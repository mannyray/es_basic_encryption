seathere are none more readily detected than birds The wide waters of theocean and its varied coastline of cliff or sand shingle or mudflatare the haunts of many birds of specialised type Many of these birdsare only found on or near the sea they are as inseparably associatedwith it as the beautiful shells and seaweeds and anemones themselvesSome of these birds are common and widely distributed others are scarceor local in their habitat some frequent the shore others the waterwhilst many are equally at home on both Again many of them aremigratory or of wandering habits some but summer visitors otherswinter refugees It matters little however what the season may be formany interesting birds are sure to be met with by the sea the widewaters and wet tideswept shores are a perennial feeding place and asafe and congenial refugeOf all the birds that haunt the sea and the shore those of the Gullfamily are the best known From whichever direction the sea is reachedalmost invariably the first indication of its vicinity is a Gullsailing along it may be in easy careless flight or wheeling andgliding high in air above the waste of restless waters The Gull and itskindred then are inseparably associated in the minds of most people withthe sea and with them therefore it certainly seems most appropriateto commence our study of marine birdlifeThe Gull family is divided by many systematists into three fairlywelldefined groups or subfamilies viz the typical Gulls or Larinthe Skuas or Stercorariin and the Terns or Sternin The Skuashowever are included with the typical Gulls by many naturalists aproceeding for which much may be said thus reducing the threesubfamilies to two In their distribution the Gulls and Terns mayalmost be regarded as cosmopolitan but the Skuas are chiefly boreal intheir dispersal four of the half dozen known species breeding in theArctic Regions and two others dwelling in the higher latitudes of theSouthern Hemisphere Some of the species are very widely distributedthe dispersal of others is just as remarkably restricted For instancethe Glaucous Gull has a circumpolar habitat and the Blackheaded Gullranges from the Fare Islands to Japan but on the other hand Larusfuliginosus is said to be peculiar to the Galapagos Islands and Larusbulleri to New Zealand Three out of the four species of Arctic Skuasare circumpolar in their distribution the fourth may possibly be soIn adult plumage the Gulls are not remarkable for any great diversity ofcolour French gray predominates upon the upper parts the under partsare white often suffused with a delicate rosy tint the primaries areusually dark gray brown or black in many species spotted and tippedwith white Some species assume by a change of colour and not by amoult a sootybrown or black head or hood during the breeding seasonRosss Gull dons a black narrow collar at that period The wings areample long and pointed the tail is even except in Rosss Gull inwhich it is wedgeshaped and in Sabines Gull in which it is forkedThe legs are comparatively short and the feet are webbedGulls moult twice in the year When first hatched young Gulls arecovered with down Young in first plumage of the Blackheaded group ofGulls have the feathers of the mantle the scapulars and the innermostsecondaries brown with pale margins the crown nape and earcovertsbrown and the tail with a broad subterminal band of the same colourThe second plumageassumed as soon as the foregoing is completedretainsbrown marks of immaturity on the scapulars and innermost secondariesthe wingcoverts are streaked with brown and the tail still retains itsbrown subterminal band This plumage is carried until the followingspring when the brown hoodassumed for the first timeis mottled withwhite the tailband is more or less broken whilst the scapulars andinnermost secondaries assume the colour peculiar to the adult Forseveral years the white markings on the primaries gradually increase inextent until the bird arrives at perfect maturity The larger Gullsofwhich the Herring Gull may be taken as a typical speciesmature muchmore slowly the perfectly adult plumage not being assumed until thebird is four years old The plumage succeeding the downy stage is brownon the upper parts each feather with a pale margin and white on theunder parts streaked with brown After each succeeding moult in springand autumn the traces of immaturity grow less the wingcoverts andtail retaining them longest The white spots on the primaries are thelatest signs of complete maturity The colour of the feet bill irisand irides slowly changes until that characteristic of the adult isassumedGulls popularly speaking are inseparably associated with the sea yetthe haunts of many species especially during the breeding season areby no means exclusively marine ones Almost every kind of coast isfrequented by these birdsrocky headlands precipitous downs sandydunes mudflats or sloblands and marshes whilst every harbour roundthe shore of our islands is periodically visited Gulls are not verypronounced migrants They wander about a good deal during thenonbreeding season and many Arctic species draw southwards duringwinter but all the indigenous British forms are residents on and offthe coasts throughout the year With these few words of introduction wewill now proceed to give a more detailed account of the strictly Britishspecies                        GREAT BLACKBACKED GULLThis the largest of the Gulls and scientifically known as Larusmarinus is one of the least common British species most locallydistributed during the breeding season It is not known to breedanywhere on the east coast of England and but very locally on the southcoast in Dorset It becomes more numerous in the wilder districts inCornwall the Scilly Islands and Lundy and thence locally along theWelsh coast and in the Solway district In Scotland it becomes morecommon especially among the islands of the west coast including StKilda and on the north coast to the Orkneys and Shetlands It is alsowidely distributed in Ireland but there as everywhere else extremelylocal and nowhere comparatively speaking numerous During thenonbreeding season it wanders more and is then seen at many placesalong the coast I have seen as many as fifty of these fine birds in TorBay after heavy gales from the eastward Montagu asserts that this Gullis locally known as a Cob but the term is of pretty generalapplication to the larger Gulls and so far as I can learn has nodistinctive significance In St Kilda where I had many opportunitiesof studying the habits of this Gull it is regarded with hatred by thenatives owing to its depredations amongst the eggs of the otherseafowl In this island it is universally known by the name ofFarspach No Gull is more wary and yet on occasion none are bolderand more daring I have seen a bird of this species tear to pieces aPuffin I had shot as it floated upon the sea and that in spite ofseveral shots I had at it with a rifle It is a sad robber of the otherand more weakly Gulls not only pillaging their nests at everyopportunity but chasing them and making them relinquish bits of foodthey may chance to pick up within view Like the Raven and the Crow itseems fully conscious of its marauding misdeeds and correspondinglyartful as if always instinctively fearing that treatment it metes outso lavishly to creatures more helpless than itselfThe Great Blackbacked Gull is one of the least gregarious of thefamily and the large gatherings of this species that are sometimeswitnessed are chiefly due to such accidental causes as an unwontedsupply of food or a continued spell of boisterous weather which oftendrives Gulls in thousands into sheltered bays and estuaries This Gullis generally met with beating about in a solitary manner lessfrequently three or four may be seen together whilst even in thebreeding season when most Gulls congregate into colonies whose sizeseems only to be regulated by the accommodation presented it iscertainly the least sociable of all the British species It is a greatnomad during the nonbreeding season often wandering far from landresting and sleeping on the sea On the other hand it is one of theleast frequent visitors of the Gulltribe to inland districts and asits specific name of marinus indicates is closely attached to thesea The usual callnote of this fine Gull is a loud whiningoftrepeated agagag Notwithstanding the purity of its plumage andthe magnificence of its presence the Great Blackbacked Gull is almostas unclean in its habits as the Raven or the Vulture No kind of carrionis refused either lying on the shore or floating on the seaweaklydeathstricken lambs or wounded birds eggs or chicks left unguarded bytheir owners fish basking or sleeping near the surface offal cast fromthe fishing boats or quays animal refuse of all kinds form the prey ofthis GullThe usual breeding place of this Gull is the top of an isolated rockstack a little distance from the mainland less frequently it selects arange of high cliffs overhanging the sea A small island in a mountainloch is sometimes selected and occasionally this may be someconsiderable distance inland In a few chosen spots the birds nest insuch close if somewhat scattered proximity that we might call it acolony but the rule is for odd and more or less isolated pairs to bemet with and often at considerable distances apart The fact that thisGull may be found nesting in one chosen spot year by year warrants thesupposition that it may pair for life The usually scanty nest is madein a hollow amongst the short turf or heath or on the flat ledge of aprecipice Sometimes the eggs are laid in a bare hollow amongst therocks It is formed of grass dry seaweed twigs and stalks of marineplants and occasionally a tuft of wool or a few odd feathers are placedin the lining The eggs are usually three in number but sometimes onlytwo or even one They are grayishbrown or brown sometimes tinged witholive in ground colour spotted with dark umberbrown and brownishgrayThis Gull is a very light sitter but is bold and clamorous whendisturbed from the nest                       LESSER BLACKBACKED GULLVery similar in appearance but much smaller in sizeit is only abouthalf the weightthis pretty Gull the Larus fuscus of Linnus is oneof the most familiar birds of the coast especially in the morenortherly portions of the British Islands It is a more trustful speciesthan its larger ally admits man to approach it with less show of fearor wariness and may often be seen on the meadows and ploughed fieldsnear the sea seeking for its food as familiarly as a Rook or a DawSingularly enough the east and south coasts of England are not resortedto by this Gull for breeding purposes It is not known to breed south ofthe coast of Northumberland or east of that of Devonshire and this isall the more remarkable seeing that one of its most important coloniesin our area is situated upon the Farne Islands It breeds locally fromCornwall to the Solway but further northwards becomes more generallydispersed right up to the Orkneys and the Shetlands In Ireland againthis Gull is a very local breeder and is only known to nest in one ortwo localities During the nonbreeding season it wanders far from homeand may then be met with on and off most of the British coasts youngand immature birds do not resort much to the nesting colonies but roamwidely at all seasons It is a very remarkable fact that adult Gulls ofthis species are so rarely seen near Heligoland as the species breedscommonly on the Baltic and Scandinavian coasts and yet its averageappearance at the island is about once in ten years The Heligolandishname for this Gull is very appropriate signifying little mantlewearer and refers to the dark slategray mantle Unlike its largerally the present species is very gregarious and socially inclined atall seasons mixing freely not only with its own kind but with theHerring Gull and the smaller forms such as the Kittiwake and theCommon Gull These latter birds however must too often prefer its roomto its company for it repeatedly robs them of their prey and isGulllike ever ready to profit by the labours of its weaker congenersLike the preceding species it is almost omnivorous in its tastes andwill as readily make a meal from stranded garbage on the shore as fromthe living fish it deftly swoops upon as they swim near the surface Onthe Lincolnshire coasts it visits the flight nets in company with theHooded Crows and preys upon any birds that may be entangled in them Itis also a persistent follower of ships attending the trawlers andfeeding upon the refuse fish cast overboard when the trawl net isemptied It swims lightly enough even on a rough sea riding like a corkon the wavecrests and sleeps upon the water when roaming far fromland Flocks of this Gull may often be seen standing upon the mudflatsor level sandy reaches preening their plumage and waiting it may befor a turn of the tide that may bring some particular food of which theyare in quest It will be remarked that these larger Gulls especiallyoften run for a short distance before taking flight and that whenalighting they frequently keep their long wings unfolded and erect for amoment or two before finally closing them Great numbers of LesserBlackbacked Gulls and other species collect in Tor Bay during theherring and sprat seasons and at these times they will wait and watchabout the harbours and quays in fluttering hosts for the odd fish andoffal The note of this Gull very closely resembles that of the HerringGull so closely in fact that no symbol can denote the difference Itmay be syllabled as klouklou and during the breeding season isvery persistently uttered Owing to its relatively longer wings thisGull looks more graceful in the air than its larger and heaviercongener its flight is remarkably easy and buoyant and on occasionrapidThe usual breeding places of the Lesser Blackbacked Gull are low rockyislandsthese larger Gulls always prefer an island covered with coarsemarine grass sea campion and the likebut in some localities a rockstack an island in an inland lake on grassy downs in mosses andflows This Gull usually breeds in colonies and some of these are verylarge One of the most extensive within the present writersexperience is situated on the Farne Islands The entire group ofislands may be regarded as one vast colony of Lesser Blackbacked Gullsif we except a few of the outlying rocks where the Cormorants breed Itis more than likely that this Gull pairs for life seeing that itresorts to the same nesting places year by year for time out of mindThe nest even in the same colony varies a good deal in size andgeneral completeness Some birds are content merely to line a hollow inthe rocks with a little dry grass others are more bulky yet slovenlystructures rude heaps of turf heather stems sea campions or drygrass and seaweed the lining being composed of finer grasses many ofthem often semigreen Occasionally a feather or two are seen but thesemay be due more to accident than to design Few sights in the birdworldare prettier than a colony of disturbed Gulls during the breedingseason As their haunts are invaded the frightened birds rise influttering thousands drifting to and fro like a snowstorm in whicheach flake is a startled bird The noisy din the rush of wings theswooping soaring fluttering Gulls the ground strewn with nestsallcombine to form a picture in the mind that time can never efface Theeggs of this Gull are usually three in number sometimes as many asfour They vary to an almost incredible degree The ground colour variesfrom pale green to dark olivebrown and gray spotted blotched orstreaked with dark liverbrown pale brown and gray Vast numbers of theeggs of this Gull are collected for food especially at the FarneIslands The birds do not appear to suffer in any way by this systematicpillage for they are always allowed to rear a brood from a secondclutch at the Farnes and most rigorously protected whilst doing so                             HERRINGGULLOf all the gulls that frequent the British coasts this the wellknownLarus argentatus ie silverwinged is certainly the mostcommon and widely dispersed It is no exaggeration to say that theHerringGull may be met with on every part of the British coasts fromthe Orkney and Shetland Islands on the north to Cornwall and the ScillyIslands in the south from the Blasquets in the wild west of Ireland tothe mouth of the Thames and the Bass Rock in the east It is the Gullpar excellence associated in the popular mind with the sea shoretheSea Gull of the visitor to marine resorts ubiquitous wellknown fromthe Lands End to JohnoGroats For its size it is certainly thetamest and least suspecting Gull found on British waters It may bereadily recognised when adult by the pale grey colour of its mantlebut the young and immature birds are less easily identified During thenonbreeding season it wanders far and wide like the rest of its kindand is a very frequent visitor to the fields not only adjoining thesea but at some distance inland Whilst tilling operations are inprogress especially in spring it passes regularly from the coast tothe fields following the plough or collecting upon the newlymanuredpastures in quest of food Wild stormy weather I have repeatedlynoticed will also drive this Gull landwards sooner perhaps than anyother species Like its congeners it is practically omnivorous Carrionis sought after as readily as living fish and other marine creatures Ihave also known this species regularly to visit a slaughterhouse nearthe coast to feed upon the offal thrown upon the pastures for manureand I have repeatedly watched the pureplumaged birds fighting with theRooks and Crows for a share of the feast This Gull will also feed ongrain grubs and worms is a constant follower of vessels andcongregates in unusual numbers at fishing harbours during the sprat andherring seasons In its flight it is graceful in the extreme and it mayoften be seen soaring at a vast altitude like a Vulture Writing on theflight of this Gull Gtke in his fascinating work Heligoland as anOrnithological Observatory says Not only are these Gulls able tosoar in a calm atmosphere in a direction straight forwards or sidewayson calmly outspread wings but as has been more fully discussed in thecase of Buzzards they can also in a manner similar to theirs soarupwards to any desirable altitude The Gulls are able to perform theirsoaring movements on the same plane in all phases of the weather duringthe most violent storm as well as in a perfect calm progressingforwards or sideways at the most variable rates of velocity now dartingalong with the swiftness of an arrow now merely gliding as it were atthe slowest pace imaginable In the latter case indeed we arefrequently even against our will forced to the conclusion that thesebirds must have at their command some unknown means or mechanism whichprevents their sinking for neither is the surfacearea of their wingslarge enough nor are these organs sufficiently concave in form toallow of their supporting the bird after the manner of a parachute Ican endorse these remarks fully from my own observations Conf IdleHours with Nature pp 261 262 That these flights are accompaniedwith any vibratory movements of the feathers is erroneous as I have hadmany opportunities of satisfying myself especially when observing theflight of the Fulmar at St Kilda the birds then not being more thansix feet away from me when I am positive every individual feather wasin perfect restBut to return from this digression to the general habits of the HerringGull The breeding season of this Gull is in May and June Owing to itsremarkable aptitude for accommodating itself to the variouspeculiarities of the coast it is certainly the most widely dispersedGull of the British species during the season of reproduction Perhapsits favourite breeding place is a low rocky island but failing this itis equally at home upon a range of sea cliffs a stack of rocks or lessfrequently an island in a loch or as at Foulshaw Moss in Westmorelanda marsh The nest is made on a ledge or in a hollow or chink of thecliffs in a sheltered hollow of the grassy downs or amongst the thickgrowth of sea campion thrift and other marine plants that often growso luxuriantly in the birds haunts I have remarked that the nest isusually larger when built on a cliff than when on the ground and insome cases is almost dispensed with It is composed of turf dryseaweed coarse grass and stalks of various marine plants lined withfiner grass often gathered green The eggs are two or three in numbervarying in ground colour from pale bluishgreen through yellowishbrownto olivebrown and the spots are small and few and dark brown palebrown and gray This Gull will lay a second lot of eggs if the firstclutch be taken as they often are for culinary purposes When thenesting places are intruded upon by human visitors the Gulls as usualbecome very noisy the birds whose eggs are most directly threatenedbeing filled with the greatest clamour I have often remarked that Gullswhose nests were safe in inaccessible parts of the cliffs have remainedquietly sitting on them while their less fortunate neighbours have beenfilled with noisy alarm as they watched the fate of their eggs from theair above The note is very similar to that of the preceding species                              COMMON GULLThis pretty Gull the Larus canus of Linnus is during the summermonths especially one of the most locally distributed of the Britishspecies The Common Gull formerly bred in Lancashire but at the presenttime is not known to do so anywhere in England From the Solwaynorthwards it becomes tolerably common as a breeding species right upto the Shetlands in many inland localities as well as on the coast Itis also a somewhat local bird in Ireland The Common Gull or BlueMaa as it is locally known is about half the size of the HerringGull with a mantle in the adult almost as dark as that of the LesserBlackbacked Gull During the nonbreeding season this Gull is fairlywell distributed along the coast and then visits localities where it isnever seen in summer It is a decided shore species rarely wanderingfar out to sea and is one of the first Gulls driven inland by stormyweather Although popularly believed to be so inseparably associatedwith the sea the Gulls and especially the smaller kinds such as theone now under notice often resort to fields even at some distance fromthe water The Common Gull seems as much at home inland as on the shoreI have seen it on the high moorlands and in Scotland flying about manya loch pool or landlocked sea arm it is equally at home on theploughed lands and the pastures yet its plumage seems strangely out ofplace in such localities and the incongruity is further intensifiedshould the startled birds take refuge in a neighbouring tree as theysometimes do There is nothing specially remarkable about the flight ofthis Gull it is performed in the slow and deliberate manner of allthese birds and is equally wonderful in many of its characteristicsThe food of this Gull is composed indiscriminately of marine andterrestrial creatures The bird will follow the plough or search thepastures for grubs insects and worms it searches the shore for anystranded creature to its omnivorous taste it hunts the wide waste ofwaters in quest of fish and follows vessels to pick up any refuse thatmay be thrown from them This Gull is to a great extent nocturnal inautumn and winter Its note is a harsh and persistently utteredyakyakyak most frequently heard when its breeding places areinvaded by man or predaceous animals The Common Gull is a thoroughlygregarious and social bird often congregating in large flocks andmingling with other speciesBy the end of April most of the adult Common Gulls have left all oursouthern coasts and retired northwards to their breeding places Asthese are visited yearly in succession it is not improbable that thisGull pairs for life Its nest colonies are situated both inland and onthe coast An island in a mountain lake the marshy shore of a loch theflat tablelike summit of a rock stack or the rolling grassy downs nearthe open sea in little populated districts may be chosen but so faras my experience with this Gull extends I have found the favourite siteto be rocky islands in quiet secluded sealochs These colonies ofCommon Gulls vary a good deal in size and in some districts perhapswhere suitable sites are scarce the bird breeds in scattered pairsonly The eggs are laid during the last half of May and the first halfof June only one brood is reared in the season but if the first eggsare taken they are generally replaced The nest of this Gull varies muchin size some structures are mere hollows lined with a tuft or two ofgrass others are more elaborate composed of heather stems pieces ofturf seaweed and stalks of marine plants lined with finer grassoften gathered green They are built indiscriminately amongst the longherbage in hollows and crevices of rocks or on ledges of the barecliffs In Norway the eggs of this Gull have been taken from thedeserted nest of a Hooded Crow in a pine tree but no instances of asimilar character have occurred so far as is known in our islands TheCommon Gull usually lays three eggs but instances of four are not rareThey run from olivebrown to buffishbrown in ground colour spotted andoften streaked with darker brown and brownishgray The eggs of thisGull are extremely good eating One often wonders why they are notgathered for the table just as much as those of the Lapwing                               KITTIWAKEThis charming Gull the Larus tridactylus of scientists so named fromits entirely absent or rudimentary hind toe is one of the best knownas it is one of the most widely distributed British species Theseremarks are however most applicable to the nonbreeding season forduring the nesting time it is rather more local owing to the conditionsunder which its young are reared The Kittiwake very closely resemblesthe Common Gull in general appearance but the mantle is paler the legsand feet are dark brown and the primaries or longest feathers of thewings have broad black tips it is also a perceptibly smaller bird thesmallest in fact of the typically marine Gulls Of all the British Gullsthe Kittiwake is certainly the most maritime in its habits and is neverknown to visit inland districts unless driven from the coast by stormsof exceptional violence Save in the breeding season it may be met withon all the lowlying coasts visiting harbours bays and fishingvillages and imbuing many a littoral scene with life The Kittiwake isa much more oceanic bird than the Common Gull and often wanders immensedistances from land in quest of food It is said that birds of thisspecies have been known to follow vessels across the North Atlantic butthis seems almost incrediblenot because the bird is physically unableto perform the feat but because we can scarcely believe any bird wouldwander of its own freewill so far from the local centre of its habitatOne of the most striking characteristics of the Kittiwake is itspeculiar cry heard to the best advantage at the nesting places Thisnote from which the colloquial name of the species is derivedresembles the syllables kittyaake requiring but little play uponthe imagination to render as getawayahgetaway It is only duringthe breeding season that this cry is heard to perfection and after thatis over the bird becomes a singularly silent one The flight of thisGull is light and buoyant but powerful and often long sustained Thebird may often be observed fishing at no great distance from shoreflying to and fro every now and then poising and hovering previous topouncing down upon a fish or other floating object It is also an adeptswimmer and very frequently sleeps whilst sitting on the waves TheKittiwake is perhaps more exclusively a fishfeeder than any otherBritish Gull It seldom searches for food on shore and does not exhibitthose omnivorous tastes that characterise so many of its congeners Itis a persistent follower of fish shoals especially herrings and spratsand will remain in the company of fishing fleets for weeks together Ascrap of food thrown from a ship will speedily be seized by one of thesebirds whilst a few crustaceans and other marine creatures are takenfrom time to timeThe Kittiwake is a rather late breeder It most probably pairs for lifeas the same nesting places are resorted to each season Of all the Gullsnone breed in more inaccessible situations The nests are almost alwaysbuilt upon a beetling ocean cliff against which the waves are for everbeating in ceaseless strife Except during the three months or so of thebreeding season this Gull is seldom seen at its nesting sites In Aprilor May the birds collect at their various stations never quite to leavethem again until the young are able to fly It is a very gregariousbird and some of these gulleries are very extensive containing manythousands of pairs In some localities however where the accommodationis either limited or unsuitable but a few birds congregate to form acolony The nests often made as close together as they can be wedgedare built upon the ledges shelves and prominences of the rocksFavourite spots are where the cliffs overhang or at the entrance of acave or hollow in the precipice They are made at varying heights on thecliff tier above tier the lowest often within a few feet of highwatermark but the most crowded places are usually about midway up from thesea The nests are large and well made many of them apparently theaccumulation of years composed externally of turf and roots with muchof the soil attached and caked together Upon this foundation a furthernest of seaweed and the stalks of various plants is formed finallylined with finer and dry grass and sometimes a few feathers The nestsand the cliffs in their vicinity are thickly whitewashed with thedroppings of the birds The eggs are two or three in number rarelyfour and vary from greenishblue through pale buff and buffishbrownto brownisholive blotched and spotted with reddishbrown paler brownand gray No words of mine can adequately describe the beauty andanimation of a colony of Kittiwakes Their cries are deafening and whenthe frightened birds flutter from the cliffs and pass to and fro inthousands like a living snowstorm the effect whether seen from thewater or from the cliffs above is charming in the extreme It is sad tothink that such a spot should too often become a scene of slaughter Butsuch is the case the poor birds breeding too late fully to profit bythe protection afforded by law Vast numbers of this pretty gentle Gullare killed yearly for the sake of their plumage Even when the breedingplaces are left the poor birds are shot in thousands out at sea TheKittiwake is the most trustful perhaps of the Gulls and a flock willremain hovering round a boat until almost decimated by the gunners Theyoung Kittiwake is widely known along the coast under the name ofTarrock                           BLACKHEADED GULLIn most inland districts frequented by this Gull the Larus ridibundusof Linnus it is known as the Peewit the Peewit Gull or theLaughing Gull It is not only one of the most widely distributed butone of the best known of our sea birds And yet to describe theBlackheaded Gull as a sea bird in the sense we have hitherto used theterm is to say the least somewhat misleading This species belongs toa small group which might more appropriately be termed marsh Gulls Itis almost as much seen in certain inland localities as it is in marineones whilst in many of its habits it bears a close resemblance to theRookfeeding on the pastures following the plough and perchingregularly in trees During spring and summer many of these Gulls resortto inland haunts to breedas for instance at Scoulton Mere in NorfolkTwigmoor in Lincolnshire and Aqualate Mere in Staffordshireand fromthese centres visit the surrounding country for miles in quest of foodSloblands and low muddy coasts are favourite haunts of this Gull butduring the nonbreeding season it may be met with on almost all parts ofthe coast In winter it often wanders up the larger tidal rivers formiles and the Gulls that visited the Thames in such abundance duringrecent winters were principally of this species doubtless from Norfolkand Essex Many of these Gulls appear to pass our southern coastsespecially in spring and I have remarked them again in great plentyduring the sprat season in late autumn I may in addition state thatthis migration has been observed along the coast of South Devon thenearest breeding station being near Poole in Dorset The birds lingerabout Tor Bay in spring until in many cases the full breedingplumagethe sootybrown headis assumedOwing to the great diversity of its haunts the Blackheaded Gull isalmost omnivorous in its diet Inland it feeds on grubsespeciallywirewormsinsects worms freshwater fish and newly sown grain as Ihave often ascertained by dissection on the sea coast it subsists onfish crustaceans and various odds and ends obtained about harbours orvessels It seeks its food both whilst swimming about the waterfluttering above it or when walking on the shore This Gull is muchmore Ternlike in its habits than the larger species we have alreadydealt with Of its services to the agriculturist there can be noquestion it is just as useful on the land as the Rook without thatbirds few little pilfering waysThe Blackheaded Gull is an inland breeding species and resorts tomarshes wet moors and meres at varying distances from the seaSometimes these breedingplaces are in fairly welltimbered districtsand often surrounded by trees and bushes This Gull too is remarkablygregarious during the breeding season and some of its colonies are veryextensive consisting of many thousands of pairs The gulleries arevisited for nesting purposes in March or April and as the birds returnto the same spots year after year they probably pair for life Nestingbegins in April Most of the nests are made upon the ground in rushtufts in hassocks of coarse grass and sedge amongst reeds in shallowwater on masses of the previous years decayed aquatic vegetation oron the flat spongy mosscovered ground Odd nests are occasionallymade in the trees and bushes or even on boathouses Many of the nestscan only be described as mere rounded hollows in the cushions of grassor sedge the more elaborate structures are usually in the wettestsituations and these latter are often added to as incubation advanceseither to replace the wear and tear from the incessant wash of thewater or to provide a sufficiently large platform on which the youngmay rest The nests are made of bits of reed and rush coarse grassflags and scraps of moss lined with finer materials of similardescription The eggs of this Gull are usually three in numbersometimes four They are subject to much variation ranging from richbrown to pale bluishgreen in ground colour spotted blotched blurredand streaked with several shades of brown and gray Large numbers ofthese eggs are gathered for culinary purposes the crop beingsystematically taken and the birds always allowed eventually to situpon their final clutch Many of these eggs are passed off for those ofthe Peewit by unscrupulous dealers notably in Leadenhall market Fewscenes in the bird world are prettier than a colony of BlackheadedGulls When disturbed at their nests the birds rise in flutteringcrowds drifting noisily to and fro anxious for the safety of theireggs or helpless young As is the invariable rule with birds thatcontinue to replace their taken eggs but one brood is reared in theseason                               THE SKUASThese birds may be readily distinguished even when on the wing by thecuneiform or wedgeshaped tail and by the dark upper plumage The billis also much stouter and hooked at the point whilst the claws are sharpand curved Skuas are only exceptionally seen by the ordinary visitor tothe seaside In the first place they only breed in our islands in theextreme north or west of Scotland and in the second place they aredecidedly oceanic in their habits after the nesting season is passedOccasionally Skuas may be seen on migration especially in autumn andalong our eastern and southern seaboard occasionally they are drivenshorewards by protracted stormy weather and under these circumstanceshave frequently been known to visit inland localities Odd birds aregenerally seen perhaps a party of half a dozen but on very exceptionaloccasions large flocks make their appearancewitness the thousands ofPomarine Skuas that visited the coast of Yorkshire during the autumns ofthe years 1879 and 1880The Skuas are birds of remarkably powerful flight displaying marvellouscommand over themselves in the air turning and twisting with greatspeed These birds are the Raptors of the sea a terror to the Gulls andTerns merciless robbers of the hardwon spoil of more weakly speciesdestroyers even of the eggs and helpless young of other sea birds Allthe four species of northern Skuas are visitors to the British Seas butonly two of them are indigenous to our islands The first of these to benoticed here is the Great Skua Stercorarius catarrhactes one of themost local of British birds during the breeding season as its onlyknown nesting places in our area are on Unst and Foula two smallislands of the Shetland Group Except during the breeding season theGreat Skua is mostly oceanic in its habitat wandering long distancesfrom land in quest of prey attending vessels and fishing fleets onlydrawing landwards by stress of weather or unusual abundance of foodThis Skua is practically omnivorous During its summer sojourn near andon the land it repeatedly raids the colonies of other sea fowl to preyupon exposed eggs or unguarded young it captures the smaller Gullsnotably the Kittiwake it also picks up any stranded fish or othercarrion and is constantly on the watch to chase any Gull or Tern thatcatches a fish following the poor bird with fatal persistency untilterror stricken it disgorges its food which is promptly seized by thevoracious Skua The call note of this Skua is very similar to that ofthe Lesser Blackbacked Gull but when under the excitement of chasingother birds or of seeking to guard its own domain the bird utters aloud cry which is likened by many observers to the word skua orskuiThe Great Skua resorts to its breeding grounds in April and the eggsare laid in May As it returns yearly to the same places it verypossibly pairs for life The nests are made upon the ground of the highmoorlands amongst the heath and grass and are mere hollows in themoss sometimes lined with a little dry grass The eggs of this Skua aretwo in number and vary from pale buff to dark olivebrown in groundcolour sparingly spotted and speckled with dark brown andgrayishbrown These eggs are large in size and very closely resemblethose of the Herring Gull But one brood is reared in the year and bythe end of August the young birds and their parents desert the nestingcolony and adopt their pelagic habits Few birds are so courageous indefence of their nests as the Skua Even such predaceous creatures asEagles Ravens and dogs are driven off whilst human intruders arescreamed at and approached within a few feet the birds wrathfullyextending their legs as if they would strike and skimming to and fro inrage Many tales of this birds daring at its nesting places are currentin Shetland where it is known almost universally as the BonxieOur second species is Richardsons Skua the Stercorarius richardsoniof some systematists the S crepidatus of others Although not quiteso local as the preceding species its breeding area is remarkablyrestricted so far as the British Islands are concerned It breeds onthe Hebrides in Caithness and Sutherlandshire and on the Orkneys andShetlands Richardsons Skua is a more gregarious species than itslarger relative but its habits generally are much the same It is forits size equally daring and rapacious is also remarkable for itspowers of flight but differs from the Great Skua in being moregregarious Richardsons Skua is for the most part a summer migrant tothe British Islands and numbers of birds pass along our coasts inspring to their northern breedinggrounds It is only during the seasonsof passage that the visitor to our southern coasts may hope to fall inwith this bird and even then it does not approach the land much Likethe other Skuas the present species is a relentless robber of the Gullsand Terns chasing them up and down until they disgorge their fish andrepeating the process at every opportunity Eggs young birds andcarrion are also eaten It is said to capture weakly birds but I donot think it is so much addicted to this Hawklike habit as thepreceding species During summer insects and ground fruits are eatenwhilst it has been known to take worms and molluscs The note of thisSkua is described either as a plaintive mee or kyow and when inchase of a bird it has been likened to the syllable yah oft repeatedRichardsons Skua reaches its breedinggrounds in the British Islandsearly in May Its haunts at this season are open moors at no greatdistance from the sea Although social at its breedingplaces it canscarcely be described as gregarious and the nests are usually scatteredup and down the moorland area This Skua appears to pair annually andthe nest always made upon the ground is merely a hollow carelesslylined with a little dry herbage and sometimes nothing but a shallowcavity in the moss The eggs normally are two but sometimes threehave been found and occasionally but one They range from olive tobrown in ground colour spotted and speckled with darker brown andgrayish brown Incubation is performed by the female and lasts about amonth At its breedingplaces Richardsons Skua is very demonstrativeand often reveals the situation of the nest by its anxious movementsabove the intruders head After the young are reared the moors aredeserted and for the remainder of the year this Skua is decidedlypelagic in its habits and hauntsWe now pass to the Terns These pretty graceful birdswidely known asSea Swallowsdiffer in many respects from the Gulls and Skuas Theymost closely resemble the former in general appearance but may beeasily distinguished by their slender form small size and forked tailOf the dozen species that have been regarded as British no less thanfive breed within the limits of our islands The Terns are far morelocally distributed than the Gulls Many miles of coast may be traversedwithout one ever seeing a Tern They are all migratory birds with usvisiting Britain in summer to breed and retiring south again in autumnIt is only during the season of passage therefore that they are at allwidely dispersed for the remainder of their sojourn on our coasts isspent at or in the near vicinity of their breedingstations The fiveindigenous British species follow                             SANDWICH TERNThis fine speciesthe Sterna cantiaca of Gmelin and the Ssandvicensis of Lathamis not only the largest of the indigenousBritish Terns but one of the rarest It was formerly much more widelydispersed along our coasts but persecution has thinned its numbers andthe seaside holidaymaker has banished it from many of its oldtimehaunts Special interest attaches to this bird because it is one of thevery few species that have been first made known to science fromexamples obtained in the British Islands It was first discovered in1784 at Sandwich on the coast of Kent and described by Latham threeyears later Alas no longer does this beautiful Tern breed in its earlyhaunts on the Kentish coast it has disappeared from there as it hasfrom many another locality without hope of return The most importantbreedingplace of this Tern and certainly the most accessible to themajority of observers is situated on the famous Farne Islands evenhere the bird is much less common than it used to be There are smallcolonies on Walney Island in Cumberland in the Solway district onLoch Lomond in the Firth of Tay and on the coast of Elgin Its onlyknown breedingstation in Ireland is in Co MayoThe Sandwich Tern reaches the British coasts in April or early in MayBut little is seen of this species whilst on passage for it evidentlykeeps some distance from shore as a rule or passes quickly andunobserved The smaller Terns for instance are commonly seen on thecoast of South Devonshire in Spring and Autumn but I cannot recall asingle strong migration of the present species in that locality ThisTern is seldom or never seen at any distance from the sea Most of itswaking time is spent in the air flying about with easy gracefulmotion in quest of its finny prey The Sandwich Tern however isnothing near so graceful looking on the wing as its smaller relativesthe heavier body broader wings and much less acutely forked tailgiving it a heavier more cumbersome appearance Most of its food isobtained whilst it hovers above the sea The way in which all the Ternsfeed is very pretty They poise and hover above their finny victims andevery now and then dart downwards like a stone into the water andcapture a fish fluttering up again or remaining for a moment toswallow their capture A flock of Terns of any species fishing is oneof the prettiest sights imaginable In addition to small fish theSandwich Tern devours crustaceans of various kinds whilst its young arefed largely upon sandlice and beetles The Terns are much cleanerfeeders than the Gulls and I have never known them touch carrion orrefuse I have however seen them pounce down upon scraps of foodthrown from a vessel The usual callnote of the Sandwich Tern is asomewhat shrill screamThis Tern probably pairs for life and returns regularly every season toits oldaccustomed haunts to breed These are by preference low rockyor sandy islands covered with marine herbage varied with barerpatches and with beaches of rough shingle Similar conditions aresought on the mainland in a secluded spot on the coast but an islandis always preferred The Sandwich Tern is gregarious but its colonieswith one exception in our islands are nowhere very extensive This oneexception is at the Farne Islands where it has been computed the birdsnumber upwards of a thousand pairs As the nestingplaces are visitedvery regularly year by year this Tern probably pairs for life I havenoticed however that the birds shift their actual breeding ground fromtime to time using several spots in succession One year they will nesthere another year there on the same small island perhaps butsometimes removing en masse to another one of the group The nests arealways placed upon the ground either amongst the sand shingle anddrifted debris a short distance from high water mark or amongst thesea campion thrift and coarse grass further inland sometimes a baremound on the highest part of the island is selected Many nests are madewithin a small area sometimes so close together as to render walkingamongst them without treading on their contents a difficult matter Thenests are slight enough mere hollows lined with a few bits of witheredherbage and in some cases even this simple provision is neglected Theeggs which are laid from about the middle of May to the middle of Juneare generally two in number but sometimes three These vary fromcreamywhite to rich buff in ground colour handsomely blotched andspotted with various shades of brown and gray During the hot June daysthe eggs seem to require little incubation but there are always plentyof birds about the spot ready to rise fluttering and screaming into theair when their breeding grounds are invaded by man But one brood isreared in the season yet if the first clutches of eggs be lost theywill be replaced                              COMMON TERNThis Tern known as the Sterna hirundo of Linnus by most Britishornithologists although there can be little doubt that the greatSwedish naturalist applied the term indiscriminately to this and theArctic Tern is one of the best known British species especially roundthe English and Welsh coasts It becomes rarer in Scotland where it islargely replaced by the Arctic Tern The Common Tern distinguished byits white underparts from the Arctic Tern is migratory and arrives onthe British coasts towards the end of April retiring south in AutumnIts favourite haunts during the summer are the various groups of lowrocky islands and the more secluded portions of the coast wheresandbanks and shingle occur Save on passage this Tern is seldom seenfar from the vicinity of its nest colony The flight of the Common Ternis exceedingly buoyant and graceful the long slender wings and acutelyforked tail assisting greatly in the general effect Like the Swallowsthe tarsus of the Terns is remarkably short so that on the ground thebirds seem awkward and rarely attempt to walk far on the sea howeverthey are quite at home and swim well There are few prettier sightsalong the shore than a flock of Terns busy in quest of food Where thebeach is rocky and the water somewhat deep inshore the birds may bewatched with ease In a serried throng they flutter to and fro ever andanon a bird falls down like a fragment of white glittering marble intothe sea with a loud splash and in a moment rises again with its finnyprey Bird after bird keeps dropping so now and then a bird remainsswimming on the water now and then two birds chase each other in rapidflight And so for miles the Terns will continue to follow the shoaluntil hunger is satisfied or the fish retire to greater depths Thefood of this species is chiefly composed of small fish but insects andcrustaceans are also devoured The note of the Common Tern is a shrillkrick or kreeick most frequently uttered when the bird is flyingalarmed over its invaded nesting placeThe Common Tern is rather a late breeder its eggs not being laid untilthe end of May or early in June It breeds in companies of varying sizethe suitability of the site being in some measure a determining causeThis Tern is equally capricious in the site selected for the nestssometimes one spot is chosen sometimes another but there can be littledoubt that the bird pairs for life and evinces considerable attachmentfor its accustomed haunts I have found almost invariably that theCommon Tern habitually lays its eggs farther from the water than theArctic Tern and always prefers to conceal them amongst vegetation ofsome kind Islands are always preferred to the mainland doubtlessbecause of their greater safety We cannot class this bird as anelaborate nest builder a mere hollow scantily lined with a littlewithered grass or weeds being the only provision The two or three eggsvary from buff to grayishbrown in ground colour blotched and spottedwith several shades of rich brown and gray But one brood is reared andas soon as the young are strong upon the wing the nesting places aredeserted and the movement south beginsTerns migrate leisurely in autumn often remaining a day or so here andthere on and off the coast and are then seen in localities which theynever frequent during summer                            THE ARCTIC TERNThis Tern widely known to systematists as the Sterna arctica ofTemminck was unaccountably confused with the preceding species untilthe German naturalist Naumann appears first to have pointed out theirspecific distinctness The Arctic Tern is par excellence the Tern ofour northern coasts say from the Farne Islands and Lancashire onwardsto the Orkneys and the Shetlands I am not aware that it breeds anywhereon the English coast between Spurn and the Scilly Islands but there area few scattered colonies on the west coast of England and Wales Thispretty Tern may be distinguished from its near ally the Common Ternwhich it closely resembles in size and general appearance by itsgrayer under parts and perceptibly longer outermost tail feathers Likeall its congeners the Arctic Tern is a summer migrant to the Britishseas and coasts arriving from the south late in April or early in MayIt prefers very similar haunts to those of the preceding specieslowrocky islands with sandy or shingly beaches and with a fair amount ofgrass and other marine vegetation upon them It is equally gregarious inits habits breeding in colonies and returning regularly to certaindistricts to rear its young Its slenderer form and proportionatelylonger wings and tail make it even more elegant looking in the air thanits congener It catches its food in the same Hawklike or Gannetlikemanner pouncing down into the water and seizing the tiny fish as theyswim near the surface No Tern dives and it is certainly exceptionalfor the bird completely to immerse itself usually it flutters on thesurface for a moment then rises again Small fish and crustaceans formthe principal food of this species Its note is very similar to that ofthe preceding Terna shrill and monotonous krick often prolonged intotwo syllablesThe nesting season of this Tern begins in June and fresh eggs may befound throughout that month Rocky islands seem everywhere to bepreferred for nesting places and the same habit of changing the exacthatching ground prevails in this as in the preceding species The FarneIslands are or used to be a great breeding station of the Arctic Ternand there I have taken great numbers of its eggs The bird probablypairs for life It differs somewhat in its nesting arrangements from theCommon Tern inasmuch that it never makes any nest No lining of anykind is placed in the hollow which contains the eggs and this hollow isgenerally selected ready made Another peculiarity is that the eggs arefar more generally laid nearer to the water and this applies not onlyto the Farne Islands but to every breeding place of this Tern that Ihave visited The two or three eggs are laid in any little depression inthe coarse sand or shingle on the line of drift or amongst smallpebbles or even on the bare ground or rock These eggs vary from buffto olive and even pale bluishgreen in ground colour heavily blotchedand spotted especially at the larger end with dark brown paler brownand gray They are decidedly smaller than those of the Common Tern moreelongated in shape and are much more olive in general colour Whendisturbed from their eggs the Arctic Terns become very noisy and risein fluttering crowds above the sacred spot continuing to fly to andfro screaming anxiously until the intruder retires                             ROSEATE TERNIt is with some hesitation that I include this species the Sternadougalli of Montagu in the present work because if it really doesvisit our coasts now to breed it is so exceedingly rare and local thatany ordinary observer of bird life by the sea could scarcely hope tomeet with it It is interesting to remark that the Roseate Tern wasfirst made known to science from a skin that was sent to Montagu fromthe Cumbrae Islands in the Firth of Clyde It was subsequently foundbreeding on the Farne Islands by Selby it formerly bred on the ScillyIslands as well as on Foulney and Walney but so far as I can ascertainthere is no direct evidence that it breeds at any of these places nowIt may be distinguished from the Common Tern by its rosy under plumagebut as this is very apt to fade a still more infallible distinctionaccording to Mr Saunders is the white inner margin to the primariesThe Roseate Tern is a very late migrant not reaching its breedingplaces until towards the end of May In its flight and habits generallyit very closely resembles those of the preceding species but its noteis hoarser than that of the Common Tern The favourite breeding groundsof this Tern appear to be low rocky islets andso far as our islands areconcernedit is partial to nesting among a larger colony of Arctic orCommon Terns It does not appear to make any nest but deposits its twoor three eggs on the bare ground usually in a little hollow amongst theshingle These eggs very closely resemble those of the Common Tern soclosely in fact that no reliable means of distinguishing them can begiven                              LESSER TERNThis species Sterna minuta is by far the smallest of the Terns thatvisit the British coasts in summer to breed It cannot be said to beanywhere common and its breeding stations are few and far betweenCuriously enough it is not known to breed on that great resort ofBritish sea fowl the Farne Islands There can be no doubt that thisTern is slowly becoming rarer and in view of this fact I do not feeljustified in assisting its extermination by naming a single localityknown to me where it now breeds The birdloving reader will I am sureappreciate this reticence Small colonies of this pretty Tern aresituated here and there round the British coasts and in one or two moreinland localities The partiality of the Lesser Tern for the coast ofthe mainland rather than for islands as a nesting ground contributeslargely to the decrease in its numbers It arrives on our coasts in Mayand is readily distinguished from all its congeners by its small sizeIn its habits it is certainly gregarious but nowhere are its gatheringsas extensive as in the other common British species Like its congenersit is eminently a bird of the air flying up and down in restlessuncertain flight living almost entirely on the wing during the daytimeonly seeking the sands or the sea to sleep or to rest It may be watchedflying along the coast a short distance from land in a slow irregularway every now and then poising for a second and then dropping into thewater with a tiny splash to seize a fish or a crustacean Its note isnot quite so harsh as that of the larger species and may be describedas a shrill pirr most frequently uttered when its breeding places areinvaded Its food is composed of small fish insects sandlice andcrustaceans most of which is secured whilst the bird is on the wingThe Lesser Tern begins breeding in June Like all the other species itreturns unfailingly to certain spots along the coast each summer andmay therefore be presumed to pair for life Its favouritebreedinggrounds are extensive stretches of sand varied with slips andbanks of coarser shingle It makes no nest not even so much asscratching a hollow for its eggs but lays them on the bare ground Itis most interesting to remark that this Tern never lays its eggs on thefine sand but always on the bits of rough beachwhere the ground isstrewn with little stones broken shells and other dbris of theshorewhere their colour harmonises so closely with surrounding objectsthat discovery is difficult The eggs are from two to four in numberIhave on two separate occasions taken clutches of the latterbut threemay be given as the average They vary from buff to grayishbrown incolour blotched and spotted with various shades of darker brown andgray During the hottest hours of the day the female sits but littleupon them and it is remarkable how quickly these shore birds will risefrom their nests at the first sign of impending dangerthe alarmdoubtless being given by the male bird from the air above It is a mostexceptional thing to see a conspicuously coloured bird rise from itsnest in a bare situation the eggs are generally coloured protectivelyand resemble the objects around them the presence of the showilyattired parent would inevitably lead to their discovery Early inautumn when the young are strong upon the wing the return journey tothe winter home on the African coast begins and it is during thesemigration journeys that the bird is perhaps most commonly observedalong the British seaboard                              BLACK TERNAllusion may here perhaps be permitted to the Sterna nigra orHydrochelidon nigra of ornithologists The Black Tern formerly bredcommonly in our marshes and fens but has long ceased to do so The CarSwallow as it used to be widely called in the fens belongs to thegroup known as Marsh Ternsbirds that rarely frequent the sea coast atall so that its absence from our avifauna although greatly to bedeplored could scarcely be remarked by the observer of marine speciesalone The Whitewinged Black Tern and the Whiskered Tern complete thisdivision known as Marsh Terns Both these latter are occasionalwanderers to the British Islands

the most part seen flying in the airor swimming upon the sea but the Plovers and the Sandpipers spend thegreater part of their time on the ground Again Gulls when adult areremarkably showy birds but the Plovers and allied species are just asinconspicuous Many of the haunts frequented by Gulls are utterlyunsuited to the Plovers and Sandpipers These principally delight in lowsandy coasts mudflats sloblands and salt marshes Rocks and rangesof cliff have no attraction for these little feathered runners of theshore they obtain their food on the shallow margin of the sea on thesand and shingle the mud and the ooze or at low water among theweeddraped stones They are emphatically beach birds Such parts of thecoast that have little or no beach uncovered at high water on whichthey may rest whilst the tide is turning or at low water on which theycan seek for food are but little frequented by these Limicoline birdsConsequently we find them much more abundant on the flat eastern coastsof England and some parts of the southern coasts with their miles ofsand and mud and wide estuaries than on the much more rockbound northand westThe Plovers with their allied forms the Sandpipers and Snipes andbetween which no very pronounced distinction is known to existconstitute a welldefined group of birds perhaps on the one hand mostclosely allied to the Gulls and on the other hand to the BustardsThere are more than two hundred species in this group distributed overmost parts of the world The Limicol under which term we include thePlovers Sandpipers and their allies present considerable diversity inthe colour of their plumage and in a great many species this colourvaries to an astonishing degree with the season The most brilliant huesare assumed just prior to the breeding season the winter plumage ismuch less conspicuous To a great extent this colour is protective thebrighter plumage of summer in many species harmonising with the inlandhaunts the birds then frequent the duller hues characteristic of winterassimilating with the barer groundthe sands and mudflats It is worthyof remark that the species which do not present this great diversity intheir seasonable change of plumagesuch as the Snipes andWoodcocksconfine themselves to haunts clothed with vegetation all theyear round oras in the case of the Ringed Ploversto bare sands andshingles In their moulting the Limicol are most interesting It isimpossible to enter very fully into the details of this function in thepresent volume nor is it necessary for the purpose of this study ofmarine birdlife to do so A few of the most salient facts howevermay be mentioned The young of all Limicoline birds are hatched coveredwith down and are able to run soon after their breaking from the shellThey consequently spend little time in the nest after they are hatchedThis down varies considerably not only in the pattern of the colour butin the colour itself Some of these chicks or young in down arebeautifully striped or spotted others are sprinkled or dusted withdarker or lighter tints than the general colour In all however thecolours are eminently protective ones and harmonise so closely with thehues of surrounding objects that discovery is difficult more especiallyso as the chicks possess the habit of crouching motionless to the groundwhen menaced by danger The first plumage of the young bird in thepresent order approaches more or less closely in colour that of thesummer plumage of the adult At the beginning of autumn however thesebright colours begin to be changed for a dress which resembles thewinter plumage of their parents This is not effected however by amoult but by a change in colour of the feathers only the very worn andabraded ones being actually replaced In the spring following theseimmature birds moult into summer plumage similar to that of the adultsalthough the wing coverts retain their hue characteristic of summer orthe breeding season until the next autumn when for the first timethese feathers are changed for the gray or brown ones of winter Itshould here be remarked that the wing coverts of the adults seem only tobe moulted in the autumn so that this portion of their plumage isalways the same colour after the bird reaches the adult stage of itsexistence The phenomenon of the alteration of colour in the plumage ofbirds and especially in Limicoline species without moulting or anabsolute change of the feathers is a profoundly interesting one One ofthe most remarkable facts in connection with this phenomenon is therestoration of the worn and ragged margins of the feathers in someLimicoline species to a perfect condition without a change or moult ofthe notched and damaged feather Schlegel was the first naturalistapparently to discover that this wonderful renovation took place buthis statements seem to have been doubted by naturalists FortunatelySchlegels opinions have been fully confirmed by Herr Gtke and thereader interested in the subject is referred to that great naturalistsremarks thereon in his book on the birds of Heligoland[1] This seasonalchange of colour may be produced both by a moult and by actualtransition without cast of feather even in the same bird therestoration of ragged feathers and development of colour upon them mayalso be progressing at the same time Thus the black markings on thehead and neck of the Golden Plover are the result of colour alterationbut the black on the breast is attained by moult The colour changes inthe Sanderling the Knot the Dunlin the Redshank and numerous otherallied birds are perfectly astonishing in the Redshank especially sothe profusely barred upper plumage being developed without change offeather and the feathers reacquiring a pristine freshness andperfectness which seem almost incredible without a complete moultComparatively speaking the haunts frequented by Limicoline birds duringsummer or the season of reproduction are not in the strict sense ofthe term littoral ones But few species breed on the actual coastinour islands they are represented by such birds as the Oystercatcher andthe Ringed Plover the vast majority rear their young in inlandlocalities on moors and downs by the side of rivers streams andlakes in swamps and so on As soon however as the duties of the yearare over great numbers of species resort to the sea coasts where inall districts suited to their requirements they form one of the mostcharacteristic avine features It is amongst birds of this order thatthe habit of migration is exceptionally pronounced some speciesjourneying every year many thousands of miles between their summerhaunts or breeding grounds and their winter homes or centres ofdispersal In the present group of birds the wings are generally longand pointed a form best adapted for prolonged and rapid flight whilstthe legs are usually longin some species as for instance theBlackwinged Stilt exceptionally soenabling the birds to wade throughshallows and over soft mud and ooze In some species the feet aresemiwebbed as in the Avocets in others they are lobed as in thePhalaropes The bill varies to an astonishing degree amongst birds ofthis class and seems specially modified to meet the varying methods bywhich food is obtained Thus we have presented to us the decurved billof the Curlew type the recurved bill characteristic amongst others ofthe Avocet or the Godwits the nearly straight bill of such forms as theOystercatcher and the Phalarope hard and chisellike in the formerand finely pointed in the latter then again the bill in many speciesis hard and horny in others it is acutely sensitive full of delicatenerves as in the Snipes and many others The bill of the typicalPlovers differs strikingly from that of the Sandpipers and Snipesinasmuch that it tapers from the base to the end of the nasal groovethen swells towards the tip It is utterly impossible in a work like thepresent which only attempts a slight sketch of marine birdlife onBritish coasts to deal adequately with the astonishing amount ofvariation even in this single organ of Limicoline birds We willtherefore now proceed to notice the most characteristic species foundon the tideways of our islands either as resident species as passingmigrants or as winter visitors It will perhaps be most convenientas well as most interesting to deal first with those species that areresident on our coasts as being the most characteristic forms of thisgroup of shore birds                            OYSTERCATCHERDuring summer this species the Hmatopus ostralegus of Linnus andother systematists south of the Yorkshire and Lancashire coasts isdecidedly local and rare but north of those localities it becomes oneof the most common and characteristic birds of the shore even extendingto the Shetlands the wildest of the Hebrides and St Kilda It is ofinterest to remark that in some parts of Scotland the Oystercatcherdrops its marine habits and frequents the banks of rivers and lochsThere is perhaps no more conspicuous no more handsome no more noisybird along the coast than the Oystercatcher It is worthily named SeaPie its strongly contrasted black and white plumage recalling at oncethe Magpie of the inland fields and woods The favourite haunts of thisspecies are long stretches of low rocky coast relieved here and thereby patches of shingle and long reaches of sand broken with quiet bayscreeks and lochs where a large amount of beach is exposed at lowwater One may generally find an Oystercatcher about rocky islands itis also very partial to resting on these between the tides Few birdslook daintier or prettier than the present species as it standsmotionless on some weedgrown rock its pied plumage richorangecoloured bill and fleshpink legs coming out boldly against theolivegreen masses of alg It is not often however that we canapproach sufficiently close to see such details as a rule the birdrises piping shrilly into the air before it is actually seen and longbefore unaided vision can distinguish colours distinctly During summerthe Oystercatcher can scarcely be regarded as gregarious but inwinter when its numbers are increased by migrants from the northflocks of varying size may be met with When flushed the flight of thisbird is very erratic and very rapid performed by quick and regularstrokes of the longpointed wings and perhaps it is now that thecolours of the bird are seen to best advantage The call note is heardmost frequently and persistently as the bird hurries away in alarm orcareers about the air overhead anxious for the safety of its eggs oryoung This note cannot readily be confused with that of any other birdupon the coast It may best be described as a loud shrillheepheepheep The food of the Oystercatcher is composed of musselswhelks limpets crustaceans and small fish together with varioustender buds and shoots of marine plants Its chiselshaped bill enablesit readily to detach limpets from the rocks or force open the closedvalves of the mussel or the cockle Oystercatchers often frequentcertain spots on the coast to feed visiting them as soon as the tideadmits with great regularity It may here be remarked that this birdwades often through the shallows but never swims as far as I knowunless woundedThe eggs of the Oystercatcher are laid in May or June in the north alittle later than in the south The nestingplace is usually a stretchof rough pebbles or a shingly beach in some quiet bay a low rockyisland or even a stack of rocks Although Oystercatchers cannot besaid to breed in colonies like some of the Gulls and Terns numbers ofnests may be found at no great distance apart The nest is simple in theextremea mere hollow in and round which are neatly arranged flatpebbles and bits of broken shells As a rule several mock nests may befound near to the one containing the eggs These eggs are usually threein number but sometimes four pale buff or brownishbuff in groundcolour blotched spotted and streaked with blackishbrown and grayTwo distinct types are noticeable one in which the markings arestreaky and often form a zone the other in which they are largeirregular and distributed over most of the surface As soon as the nestis approached the everwatchful birds rise screaming into the air andshould many pairs be breeding in company the din soon becomes generaland deafening It is under these circumstances alone that theOystercatcher permits man to approach it closely at all other times itis certainly one of the shyest and wariest of birds on the coast                             RINGED PLOVERWith the present speciesor resident large race the gialitishiaticula major of Tristram as we should more correctly describe itwereach the true Plovers The Ringed Plover is one of the most widelydistributed of our coast birds frequenting all the flat sandy shores ofthe British Islands from the Shetlands in the north to the ChannelIslands in the south And not only does it haunt the coast but it isfound on the banks of rivers and lochs in many inland districts In manyplaces this species is known as the Ring Dotterel in others its localname is the Sand Lark The favourite haunts of the Ringed Plover arethe sandy portions of the beach but in autumn and winter this birdfrequently visits mudflats The Ringed Plover is about the size of aThrush and may be easily recognised by its broad white collar blackbreast and cheeks brown upper parts and snowwhite under parts Itsactions on the shore are most engaging tripping here and there alongthe margin of the waves over the wet sand and shingle darting this wayand that as some tempting morsel of food is discovered If in autumn orwinter this Plover will generally be met with in flocks of varyingsize if in summer in scattered pairs or parties composed of the birdsbreeding in the immediate neighbourhood Ringed Plovers are mostattached to certain haunts and seem to frequent them year by yearnotwithstanding continued persecution and disturbance It is the samewhen they are feeding If alarmed they usually rise in a compact bunchfly out to sea a little way then return inshore perhaps passing two orthree times up and down before finally alighting Again and again maythis action be repeated although the flock has a tendency to break upif flushed many times in quick succession and odd birds will fall outor remain skulking amongst the shingle A dense flock or bunch of RingedPlovers is a pretty sight The birds fly quickly and wheel and turnwith astonishing precision now close to the waves then up in the airabove the horizon often persistently uttering their shrill call notewhich resembles the syllables tooit rapidly repeated Occasionally afair sprinkling of Sanderlings and Dunlins may be observed in the flocksof this species If seriously alarmed the entire flock will mount uphigh and go off to a distant part of the coast or even divide intoseveral smaller ones each retiring to a different spot but almostinvariably they return and reform into a single company on the oldfamiliar sands within a hour or so of their scattered departure Thefood of this pretty little Plover consists of the smaller creatures ofthe shore such as minute sandworms shrimps sandhoppers tinymolluscs and insects That this species occasionally eats vegetablesubstances I have assured myself by repeated dissectionAlthough the Ringed Plover appears only to rear one brood in the yearits laying season is prolonged from the middle of April to the beginningof June Early in April the winter flocks begin to disband and thebirds to disperse over their breeding places Many pairs may be foundbreeding on one large stretch of sand in a suitable district Someindividuals seek an inland site for their eggs on the bank of a streamor lake but the majority prefer the sands of the seashoreOccasionally the nest has been discovered remote from water This Plovermakes no nest The eggs sometimes are laid in a hollow of the sand butjust as frequently on the level surface The fine sand is alwayspreferred to the shingle as the eggs best harmonize in appearance withit their fine markings becoming more conspicuous on the coarsersurface The bird sits lightly indeed it is most exceptional to see onerise from its eggs unless the spot had been previously marked Whendisturbed the birds exhibit but little outward manifestation of alarmThey may be seen running to and fro about the sand but their behaviouris very different from that of the Lesser Terns which often nest on thesame sands The eggs of the Ringed Plover are always four in numbervery pyriform in shape and invariably laid with the pointed ends turnedinwards They are large in proportion to the bird and pale buff orstone colour sparingly spotted and speckled with blackishbrown andinkgray During May and June a smaller and darker race of Ringed Ploverpasses along our coasts to breed further north appearing on the returnjourney during August September and October There is some evidence tosuggest that this race breeds sparingly on the coasts of Kent andSussex                            KENTISH PLOVERThis species the gialitis cantiana of ornithologists is one of themost local of British birds Stragglers have been obtained here andthere along the coast line between Yorkshire and Cornwall but its onlyknown nesting places are on certain parts of the coasts of Kent andSussex It is now nearly a century ago since this Plover was first madeknown to science by Lewin who figured it in his Birds of GreatBritain and by Latham who described and named it in the supplement tohis great work the Index Ornithologicus from examples which had beenobtained on the Kentish shingles by Mr Boys of Sandwich The KentishPlover bears a superficial resemblance to the Ringed Plover but mayreadily be distinguished by the broken pectoral band represented by adark patch on each side of the breast and the reddishbrown nape andcrown Unlike the preceding species this Plover is a summer migrantonly to the British coasts arriving towards the end of April or earlyin May and departing again with its young in August or September Oddbirds however have been met with during winter The Kentish Ploverdoes not differ in its habits in any marked degree from the RingedPlover and frequents very similar localities stretches of sand andshingle Like that bird it also gathers into small parties duringsummer but in our islands where its numbers are limited we moreusually find it in isolated pairs on various suitable parts of theshore It possesses the same restless habits running about the wetshining sands and shingles close to the breaking waves in quest of thesandhoppers crustaceans worms and other small marine creatures onwhich it feeds It cannot be regarded as a shy bird permitting asomewhat close approach and manifesting little fear or alarm even whenits breeding grounds are invaded by man Its alarm note may be describedas a shrill ptirr but the usual call is a clear loud whit whichduring the love season is frequently uttered so quickly as to form asort of trill as the cock bird soars and flies round and round abovehis mate The Ringed Plover utters a very similar trill during thepairing seasonThe Kentish Plover rears but one brood during the summer andpreparations are made for this towards the end of May It is notimprobable that this Plover pairs for life seeing that the samelocalities are visited year by year for nesting purposes It makes nonest the eggs being laid in a little hollow amongst the coarser sand orthe shingle or on a drift of dry seaweed and other shore dbris Theeggs are usually three but occasionally four in number and are pale ordark buff in ground colour blotched scratched and spotted withblackishbrown and slategray As is the almost invariable custom withbirds breeding on bare plains and beachesand whose eggs areprotectively colouredthe Kentish Plover sits lightly rises from hereggs as soon as danger is discovered and evinces but little outwardanxiety for their safety although in some instances the feigning oflameness has been resorted to especially when the eggs have been on thepoint of hatching The young birds and their parents form a family partyduring the autumn and apparently migrate southwards in close companyWith the present species we exhaust the number of Limicoline birds thatnest upon the shore in the British Islands All the other species thatmake our sands and mudflats their winter home or their place of callduring their spring and autumn migrations breed away from the actualbeach on marshes and moors and uplands or do not rear their young atall within our area Closely associated with most of these birds are thefascinating problems of Migration We miss the feathered hosts from sandand mudflat as the spring advances we note the fleeting appearance ofothers along the shore bound to far away northern haunts and then longbefore the first faint signs of autumn are apparent these migrant birdsbegin to return and imbue the wild lone sloblands and shingles withlife To and fro with each recurring spring and autumn the stream ofavine life flows and ebbs by day and by night the feathery tides presson calling forth wonder from the least observant filling morethoughtful minds with the complexity and the mystery of it all We havenot space to deal here with this grand avine movement but content withthis passing allusion to it pass on to a study of the other feathereddwellers by the sea Conf p 281It is rather remarkable how few species of Limicoline birds breed on theBritish coastline Not a single Sandpiper nor Snipe does so and buttwo or three Plovers as we have already seen So far as summer isconcerned these wading birds cannot be regarded as a very remarkablefeature of avine life upon the coast and it is doubtless because theyare so little known to the majority of seaside visitors that theyappeal so much less to the popular mind than the more ubiquitous GullsBut from September onwards to the following spring Plovers andSandpipers are the most prominent characteristics of all the morelowlying coasts We will briefly glance at those species that not onlyfrequent such situations regularly every season but occur in sufficientnumbers to place them beyond the category of abnormal visitors orstormdriven wanderers from their natural haunts                             GOLDEN PLOVERThis species the Charadrius pluvialis of ornithologists is from theregularity of its appearance and its great abundance known almosteverywhere as the Plover of the coast It derives its trivial namefrom the profusion of golden yellow droplike spots which adorn itsupper plumage and may always be distinguished from allied species byits barred tail feathers and white axillaries Large flights of GoldenPlover begin to appear on our lowlying coasts in September and throughOctober and November the number steadily increases Many of these birdssimply pass along our shoreline to haunts in the Mediterranean basinbut many linger thereon through the winter One of the great haunts ofthis Plover is along the shores of the Washthat vast area of mud andsand and saltmarsh which extends for miles in drear monotony onlyenlivened and made endurable by the hordes of wild fowl that congregateupon its treacherous surface Here at the end of October or during thefirst week in November the migration of the Golden Plover can beobserved in all its strength Day after day night after night I haveremarked the passage of this bird in almost one unbroken stream flocksucceeding flock so quickly as to form a nearly continuous throng Uponthe sands this Plover often associates with Dunlins Gray PloversLapwings and other waders Great numbers are or used to be shot ornetted in this district and sent to inland markets for their flesh isjustly esteemed for its delicacy ranked by some as second only to thatof the Woodcock Golden Plovers feed and move about a good deal atnight especially by moonlight Their food during winter at leastconsists of sandworms and hoppers molluscs small seeds and so onThe whistle of this Plover is one of the most attractive sounds of themudflats and saltmarshes It may under suitable atmosphericconditions be heard for a long distance across the wastes and soundssomething like kleewee occasionally prolonged into kleeeeweeThis note is uttered both while the bird is on the ground and in theair In the pairing season it is run out into a trill The movements ofthe Golden Plover during winter are largely regulated by the weatherand I have known it desert a district entirely or become very restlessand unsettled just previous to a stormIn spring the sea coasts are deserted and the Golden Plover retires toits breedinggrounds These in our islands are situated on the uplandmoors and mountain plateaux The nest invariably made upon the groundis often placed on a hassock of coarse herbage or on a tuft of cottongrass and consists merely of a hollow lined with a few bits ofwithered grass or dead leaves The eggs are four in number buffblotched and spotted with various shades of brown and more sparinglywith gray They are much richer and yellower in appearance than those ofthe Lapwing otherwise closely resemble them                              GRAY PLOVERThis handsome bird generically separated by many ornithologists fromthe preceding on account of its possessing a minute and entirelyfunctionless hind toe is the Vanellus helveticus of Brisson and theCharadrius helveticus of writers who ignore the genus Squatarolafounded by Leach on the abovenamed trivial and all things consideredutterly inadequate character The Gray Plover is the first species wehave considered in the present work that does not breed in the BritishIslands Many birds of this species only pass our coast on migration ingoing to and returning from their Arctic breedinggrounds but a fairnumber linger upon them throughout the winter The Gray Plover may bereadily distinguished from the preceding as well as from all otherallied forms by the presence of a rudimentary hind toe and by itsblack axillaries In its seasonal changes of plumage it closelyresembles its ally In the adult plumage however it never exhibits anyof the yellow droplike spots on the upper parts so characteristic ofthat bird in every feather stage of its existence Gray Plovers begin toarrive on the British coasts as early as August and the migrationcontinues with increasing strength until October or November Suchindividuals as pass our islands for more southern haunts return alongthe British coasts during May and June During its sojourn with us theGray Plover confines itself almost entirely to the mudflats and saltmarshes It does not gather into such large companies as the GoldenPloverbut this may be due perhaps to its smaller numbersand is oftenseen in pairs or small parties whilst odd birds will occasionallyattach themselves to flocks of Knots and Dunlins In its habitsgenerally in its flight and in its food it closely resembles itscommoner and better known ally The note uttered whilst the bird livesupon our coasts resembles that of the Golden PloverThe breedinggrounds of the Gray Plover are on the tundras and barrengrounds in the Arctic regions of the Old and New Worlds above thelimits of forest growth The nest is always made upon the ground and ismerely a slight hollow lined with a few scraps of withered herbage Thefour eggs very closely resemble those of the Lapwing but are not quiteso olive When once flushed from the nest the Gray Plover becomes verywary and restless and does not return for some time should the youngbe hatched various alluring antics are indulged in to withdraw attentionfrom them                                LAPWINGThis bird is the typical species of Brissons genus Vanellus and isknown to most naturalists as Vanellus cristatus or vulgaris Itcannot easily be confused with any other British bird and is readilyidentified by its long conspicuous crest metallic green suffused withpurple upper parts and bright chestnut upper and under tail covertsFurther its appearance in the air so far as British Limicoline birdsare concerned is unique the curiously rounded wings and deliberateHeronlike flight together with the peculiar note make the matter ofits identification easy to the veriest tyro in ornithology The Lapwingis also not only the commonest of its order found in Britain butcertainly the most widely dispersed Nevertheless it is only during thenonbreeding season that the Lapwing can fairly be described as a marinebird From March onwards to the early autumn it retires to inland moorspastures and rough undrained lands to breed returning coastwards againwhen the young are reared especially from the more exposed and elevatedlocalities The favourite marine haunts of the Green Plover orPeewit as this bird is otherwise called are rough saltings mudflatsand sloblands sands and shingles it rarely visits unless when drivento do so by heavy snowfalls and at all times it prefers groundovergrown with herbage to the bare beaches As this species presentslittle difference between summer and winter plumage means forconcealment may have some influence in its choice of haunt Whenstanding or running on the ground the Lapwing is a very ordinary lookingbird graceful enough it is true but the moment it rises into the airthe observer is struck with the singularity of its appearance the broadand rounded wings are unfolded and moved in a slow flapping Owllikemanner very often grotesque evolutions are indulged in the bird risingand swooping down again turning and twisting in a most erratic way andall the time persistently uttering the wild mewing plaintive cry thatis absolutely characteristic of this Ploveran unmistakable and uniquenote among birds It may be expressed on paper as a nasal peeweetfrequently modulated into weetaweet peeweetweetAs the autumn days draw on the Lapwing becomes more gregarious oftenforming into flocks of enormous size which wander about a good deal asthe varying weather affects their supply of food This in winterconsists chiefly of worms grubs molluscs crustaceans and other smallmarine creatures in summer seeds shoots of herbage and variousground fruits and berries are added The Lapwing in its movements on theground is light and elegant running and walking well standing highupon its legs but it seldom seems to wade and never so far as I knowattempts to swim under any normal circumstances Great numbers ofLapwings are killed for the table but the flesh cannot be compared withthat of the Golden Plover being not only dark in appearance butunpleasant in taste especially after the birds have resided long inlittoral hauntsThe Lapwing at the approach of spring retires inland to breed visitingfor the purpose moors rough lands water meadows pastures and grainfields The nesting habits of this species are certainly better knownthan those of any other member of the Plover tribe at least as far asBritish birds are concerned Every person at all familiar with thecommon objects of the country knows the nest of the Lapwing and musttime and again have been amused with the birds erratic behaviour asits breeding grounds are invaded by human intruders The nest is alwaysmade upon the ground generally in a hollow of some kind often in thefootprints of cattle and horses Sometimes it is cunningly hiddenbeneath a tuft of rushes or hassock of sedge and grass whilst thesummit of a molehill is not rarely chosen The hollow is lined with afew bits of the dry and withered surrounding herbage and in many caseseven this slight provision is omitted The four eggs five have beenrecorded very like pears in shape are buffishbrown or pale olive inground colour handsomely blotched and spotted especially on the largerhalf with blackishbrown paler brown and gray If the flesh of theLapwing is not held in very high repute its eggs make ample amends forthe deficiency Vast numbers are systematically gathered for the tableand as the birds will replace their stolen eggs again and again theharvest may be prolonged over several weeks The first eggs are laid inApril in more northern localities not before May In the early days ofthe Plover egg season these commodities frequently realise as much astwelve shillings per dozen and are a source of profit to many a dwellerin country districts Dogs are sometimes trained to search for themWhen the young are hatched the Lapwing displays many curious tricks tolure enemies from them feigning death or broken wings or swooping withloud cries to and fro                               TURNSTONEIt is rather a remarkable fact that this species the Strepsilasinterpres of naturalists does not breed in the British Islands Somenaturalists have suspected that it does so on the Hebrides and it hasbeen said to nest on the Channel Islands but no direct proof has yetbeen obtained Under exceptional circumstances the Turnstone may be metwith inland especially during the season of its migrations butotherwise it is strictly a coastbird as much so as the Oystercatcherand rears its young upon the shore This somewhat singular bird is metwith on the British coasts most commonly during its passage north orsouth comparatively few individuals remaining upon them for the winterThe Turnstone cannot readily be confused with any other coast bird itsmottled black and chestnut upper parts black throat and breast andwhite belly being very distinctive The wings and tail during flightexhibit a good deal of white upon them Turnstones chiefly young birdsbegin to arrive on the British coasts at the end of July and themigration of the species continues through August and September thereturn passage in spring may be remarked towards the end of April andlasts for about a month Mudflats sloblands and saltmarshes are notfrequented much by the Turnstone it always prefers the low rockycoasts and seems specially fond of haunting rocks and islands Socialto a great extent in summer in winter this bird is more or lessgregarious but many odd individuals attach themselves to parties ofother shorefrequenting species An example now lying before me was shotfrom the company of Common Sandpipers The Turnstone is a restlesslittle creature ever on the run in quest of food It may be watchedhunting about the beaches or running amongst pebbles and over thepiles of drifted rubbish that the tide washes up in a long irregularline along the shore In watching the actions of this bird the observercannot fail to remark its singular habit of turning over shells andother objects in quest of the small marine creatures that lurk underthem with its conical shaped beak and perhaps occasionally with itsbreast as well This peculiarity has gained for the Turnstone itstrivial name Not only does it run about the sand and rocks but itfrequently wades and has even been seen to swim just outside the lineof breakers rising from time to time flying a little way and thensettling upon the water again The flight of this bird is not veryrapid and generally taken close to the ground its note is a shrillwhistle resembling the syllable keet During the love season thisnote is run into a rapid trill The food of the Turnstone is composed ofsandworms crustaceans molluscs and other small marine animalsThe Turnstone changes its haunts but little during the breeding seasonIt rears its young on the beaches or on rocky islets placing its nestamongst the scanty marine herbage beneath the shelter of a tuft ofgrass or a little bush This is merely a hollow lined with a few bits ofdry grass or other vegetation The four eggs are olivegreen or palebuff in ground colour blotched spotted and clouded with olivebrowndark reddishbrown and violetgray But one brood is reared in theyear and the eggs are laid in June As soon as the young are able tofly the movement south begins The Turnstone breeds throughout thenorthern parts of the Nearctic and Palarctic regions as far as land isknown to extend Its nearest breeding stations to the British Islandsare in Denmark on some of the Baltic Islands and in Iceland Duringwinter it visits the coasts of almost every part of the world south ofthe Arctic circle                              PHALAROPESBut three species of the genus Phalaropus are known and two of theseare British birds one of them the Rednecked Phalarope Phyperboreus breeding very sparingly and locally within our limits theother the Gray Phalarope P fulicarius a more or less regularvisitor to our coasts in autumn and winter From many points of view thePhalaropes are very interesting birds They are distinguished from allother Limicoline forms by the structure of the feet which are lobedlike those of the Coota peculiarity which induced Edwards in 1741 todescribe a Phalarope as the Cootfooted Tringa They are by far themost aquatic of the Charadriid swimming as readily as Gulls or Ducksand often going for hundreds of miles out on to the open sea indeedthey spend most of their time upon the water only visiting land for anylengthened period during the breeding seasonThere can be little doubt that the Gray Phalarope is a more abundantvisitor to British waters in autumn and winter than is generallysupposed It has little reason to visit land at all at such a seasonunless driven towards it by exceptionally severe weather Occasionallyhowever this Phalarope has occurred on our coasts in great numberssomething similar to the visitations of Sand Grouse with whichdoubtless most readers are familiar The autumn of 1866 is speciallyfamous for a great rush of Gray Phalaropes to the British seas andcoasts and it is estimated that upwards of 500 were caught of whichlarge number nearly half occurred in Sussex The most recent irruptionof Gray Phalaropes was in 1886 The Gray Phalarope lives almost entirelyout at sea after the breeding season is over wandering immensedistances from land and even accompanying whales for the sake ofcatching the various small marine creatures disturbed by the blowingof those mighty animalshence to the sailor it is often known as theWhale Bird So hardy is this little bird that it has been watchedswimming about amongst icebergs far from land It swims lightly andbuoyantly as a foam fleck with a peculiar bobbing motion of the headbut it is not known to dive It apparently flies with reluctance alwayspreferring to swim out of danger Its food principally consists ofinsects but crustaceans worms and scraps of vegetable substances areeaten The call note of this Phalarope is described as a shrill weetand the alarm note heard most frequently during flight as a rapidlyrepeated bickabickaThe Gray Phalarope is not known to breed anywhere on continental Europebut does so in Spitzbergen in Iceland Greenland and probablythroughout all suitable parts of Arctic America and Asia as far northas land extends In winter it is very widely dispersed even wanderingas far as New Zealand The Gray Phalarope is one of those species thatchange greatly in the colour of their plumage according to season Inwinter dressthe plumage perhaps most familiar to British observerstheback is gray and the under parts pure white but in summer the whole ofthe latter are rich bright bay and the feathers of the upper parts aredark brown with pale reddishbrown margins In this plumage it is knownas the Red Phalarope Another interesting fact is that the female ismuch more brightly and richly coloured than the male and the latter notonly performs the duty of incubating the eggs but takes the greatershare in tending upon the young It may thus be inferred that thepairing habits of this Phalarope are most singular the femaleconducting the courtship The Gray Phalarope remains practicallygregarious throughout the year breeding in colonies of varying sizeIts favourite nestingplaces are beside the marshy pools and lakes onthe tundras at no great distance from the Arctic Ocean The nest ismade upon the ground and consists of a mere hollow in the moss orlichen lined with a few dry leaves and grasses The four pyriform eggsare pale buff tinged with olive blotched and spotted with dark brownand paler brown At the nest the old Phalaropes are remarkably tame andconfiding showing little fear of man but when the young are hatchedoften trying to delude him away by various deceptive antics As soon asthe young are sufficiently matured the nestingplaces are deserted andyoung and old repair to the sea for the remainder of the yearThe second British species the Rednecked Phalarope is scarcely lessknown to the majority of people than the Gray Phalarope It seldomvisits the land except for breeding purposes and as its nestingplacesin our area are not only few but in the remotest part of itopportunities for observing its habits are few and fitful It is asummer visitor to certain parts of the Outer Hebrides to the Orkneysand the Shetlands Outside our limits its range is very extensive Itbreeds in suitable localities throughout the Arctic regions of the Newand Old Worlds above the limits of forest growth in winter it wandersfar southwards and is then found on the coasts of Europe SouthernAsia Mexico and Central America Like the preceding species it isthoroughly marine in its choice of a haunt but does not appear towander for such great distances from land It is just as tame andconfiding just as social in summer and as gregarious in winter Itswims equally as well and buoyantly with the same peculiar bobbingmotion whilst on the land it is able to run and walk with ease Itexhibits the same reluctance to take wing preferring to retreat fromdanger by swimming although it flies on occasion quickly and well Itsfood is very similar and its note is a shrill but rather low weet AsProfessor Newton has remarked both this and the preceding species ofPhalarope are entrancingly interesting in their habits Their gracefulform their lively colouration and the confidence with which both arefamiliarly displayed in their breedingquarters can hardly beexaggerated and it is equally a delightful sight to watch these birdsgathering their food in the highrunning surf or when that is donepeacefully floating outside the breakers[2]So far as concerns Scotland the breeding season of the RedneckedPhalarope commences in May but in more Arctic localities it is deferreduntil several weeks later It returns with unerring regularity to theold accustomed spots to rear its young These are on the marshy moorsbeside the pools at no great distance from the sea The nest usuallymade on the ground in the valley of the Petchora it has been found ina hassock of coarse grass a foot or more above it is a mere hollowlined with a few scraps of dead grass and rush The four eggs are buffof various shades or pale olive spotted and blotched with amber andblackishbrown pale brown and gray As previously remarked the malebird incubates them When disturbed at its breeding grounds theRednecked Phalarope slips off the nest and takes refuge in the watermanifesting little concern for its safety As soon as the young aresufficiently matured they and their parents resort to the sea movingsouthwards as autumn advances and for the most part keeping to thewater until another nesting season comes round                                CURLEWThis species Numenius arquata is not only the largest Limicolinebird that frequents the coast but also one of the best known There arefew parts of the shore during autumn and winter where an odd Curlewcannot be found whilst in some localities it may be classed asabsolutely common The Curlew is another of those species that presentlittle difference between summer and winter plumage and yet the hauntsit selects in summer differ very considerably from those it seeks inwinter It is a resident in the British Islands but its numbers arevery considerably increased in autumn by migrants from more northernlatitudes It may be found as previously inferred on almost all partsof the shore but such beaches where wide expanses of sand mud andbroken rocks occur are specially preferredas are also saltmarshes andwet meadows close to the sea Of all wild fowl the Curlew is one of thewariest never allowing a close approach unless stalked with thegreatest care or surprised in some unusual way which does not oftenhappen In some districts where little beach is exposed duringhighwater the Curlews will retire some distance inland but returnwith remarkable punctuality as soon as the tide begins to ebb Shinglebanks and islands are also often visited between tides Curlews whenfeeding are very restless birds running and walking about the beachseemingly in a very careless and unsuspecting manner but sentinels areever on the watch to sound the warning note which sends the biglongbilled speckled birds hurrying away to safer haunts The Curlewfeeds both by day and by night and its wild somewhat mournful noteshrill and farsounding curlee curlee may repeatedly be heardduring darkness The flight of this bird is both rapid and wellsustained Gtke on evidence which seems absolutely conclusiveestimates its speed on certain occasions to be not less than a mile aminute and possibly very much more Although the Curlew repeatedlywades it is not known to swim under normal circumstances but hasoccasionally been seen to perch in a tree All through the autumn andwinter the Curlew continues gregarious It migrates in vast flocks andfrequently associates with other wild fowl although it may be thatthese other and smaller species seek its company to profit by itsextraordinary vigilance Sandworms crustaceans and molluscs form itsprincipal food whilst living on the coast but in summer at itsbreedinggrounds worms grubs insects ground fruits and berries areeaten The European form of the Curlew is pretty generally distributedover the western half of the Palarctic region and in winter is foundthroughout AfricaThe Curlew begins to leave the coast for more or less inland haunts inMarch scattering over most of our swampy moorlands and rough highergrounds to breed The eggs are laid during April and May The nest isinvariably made upon the ground and consists merely of a shallowcavity lined with a few bits of withered herbage or dead leavesNumbers of pairs often nest within a comparatively small area ofsuitable ground and should one pair be disturbed the entire communityis soon thrown into a state of alarm The four eggs of the Curlew varyfrom olivegreen to buff blotched and spotted with olivebrown and palegray The Curlew begins to wander coastwards as soon as the young arereared By far the majority seen first are young birds and these arrivefrom the middle of July onwards                               WHIMBRELThis specieswhich is the Numenius phopus of systematistsis bestknown on the British coasts during its annual migrations passing ourislands so regularly that it has received the name of May Bird On theLincolnshire coast as well as in many other districts the Whimbrel isalmost universally known as the JackCurlew During its seasonalmovements it visits most parts of the British coastline but mudflatssaltmarshes estuaries and extensive reaches of sand are the mostfavoured localities Its habits are very similar to those of theCurlewa bird which it somewhat closely resembles in general appearancealthough it is much smaller It is also a less wary bird especiallyupon its arrival much stalking however soon teaches it shynessPerhaps the Whimbrel is not so often seen on the actual beach as theCurlew it seems to prefer to resort to sloblands and swampy meadowsadjoining the beach It not only wades but is said even to swimoccasionally and is fond of bathing throwing the water over itself asit stands breasthigh in the sea In autumn and winter the Whimbrel iscertainly gregarious but its gatherings are never so large on ourcoasts as those of the Curlew This however is entirely due to localcauses for Gtke reports that on the bright warm days of April and Maythey pass over Heligoland in successive flocks at a vast height andflying at a tremendous speed On migration the note of the Whimbrel maybe described as a shrill heeheehee Its food during its sojourn insmall numbers on the British coasts consists principally ofcrustaceans sandworms and molluscsThe Whimbrel is a later breeder than the Curlew During the nestingseason it is one of the most local of our birds and is only known tonest on North Ronayone of the Hebridesthe Orkneys and the ShetlandsIts favourite breedinggrounds are the wild moors at no great distancefrom the sea Although not gregarious during summer many pairs oftennest on the same portion of the moors The nest is made upon the groundsometimes amongst heather or beneath the shelter of a tuft of grassand consists of a few bits of withered herbage arranged carelessly insome slight hollow The four eggs are very like those of the Curlew butare much smaller The birds actions at the nest are very similar tothose of the preceding species Outside the British limits the breedingrange of the typical Whimbrel reaches from Iceland and the Faresacross Arctic Europe whilst its winter home is in Africa                                GODWITSThese birds rank amongst the rarest and most local of the Britishspecies of Limicol so that little more than a passing allusion to themis necessary in a work of the present character One of them theBlacktailed Godwit Limosa melanura formerly known as the Yarwhelpor Barker used to breed regularly in some of the eastern counties ofEngland but for nearly fifty years now it has not been known to do soThe reclamation of its fenland haunts and the practice of netting itduring the breeding season have probably been the chief causes of itsextirpation A few birds still continue to appear on our coastsespecially on the vast mudflats and saltmarshes of East Anglia duringtheir annual migrations and a few remain to winter Outside our limitsit nests in Iceland and the Fares and in Scandinavia but its chiefbreedingarea extends across Europe from Holland to the south ofRussia In winter it draws southwards visiting the Mediterranean basinand parts of Africa The Blacktailed Godwit appears on the Britishcoasts on passage during April and May the return journey beginning inAugust and lasting for about a month In its habits it is very like theCurlew picking up its food on the muds and marshes walkingdeliberately to and fro wading through the shallows and sometimesstanding in the water breasthigh to sleep Whilst on actual migrationit is a restless bird continually shifting its ground but later in theyear it becomes more settled and will visit certain spots to feed withgreat regularity Its food whilst on our coasts consists of insectsespecially beetles worms crustaceans and molluscs Its callnote isa loud and shrill tyiiit This Godwit breeds in May making a slightnest on the ground concealed amongst herbage in which it lays fourpyriform eggs olivebrown spotted with darker brown and grayThe second and smaller species the Bartailed Godwit Limora rufa iscertainly the best known and by far the most abundant So far as myobservations extend this Godwit occurs in greatest numbers on themudflats and saltmarshes of the Wash where it is known in some placesas the Scamell There it is often taken in the flightnets and it isa wellknown bird to the gunners of the coast This Godwit passes alongthe British seaboard towards the end of April and early in Mayreturning from the end of August up to the first week in NovemberAccording to Professor Newton the 12th of May is known as Godwit dayon the south coast of England because about that date large flocks ofthis bird arrive thereon on their passage north Whilst with us itshabits are much the same as those of the preceding species It isgregarious throughout the winter and often associates with othershorehaunting birds Both these Godwits are readily distinguished fromother Limicoline species on the British coasts by their long andrecurved bills They also present much diversity between summer andwinter plumage The most marked difference is seen in the colour of theunderparts which the present species changes from white in winter torich chestnut in summer whilst in the Blacktailed Godwit the chestnutcharacteristic of the breeding season is confined to the neck andbreast It is only in summer plumage that the tail of the BartailedGodwit is barred in winter it is uniform ashbrown Upon its firstarrival on our shores the Bartailed Godwit is often remarkably tameadmitting a close approach It is very fond of frequenting the creeksand dykes that intersect the saltmarshes and muds and during highwater often goes inland a little way to wait for the ebb The food ofthis Godwit consists of worms crustaceans molluscs and similar marinecreatures The note resembles the syllables kykyky often verypersistently repeated as the birds fly up and down the coast In itsquest for food it frequently wades but never swims nor dives unlesswoundedBut little is known respecting the nidification of the BartailedGodwit and its eggs very rare in collections have hitherto only beenobtained in Lapland These so closely resemble those of the precedingspecies that no known point of distinction can be given                               REDSHANKDuring the greater part of the year this speciesthe Totanus calidrisof modern naturalistsresides upon the coasts retiring to more or lessinland districts to breed There are few prettier and more gracefulbirds along the shore than the Redshank distinguished by its longorangered legs and white lower back rump and secondariesthe lattermarbled with brown at the base In the breeding season the grayishbrownupper plumage and the white breast characteristic of winter aremottled with rich dark brown In autumn our resident Redshanks arelargely increased in numbers by migratory individuals from morenortherly latitudes many of these pass on to winter quarters furthersouth but many others remain with us for the winter Sociable at alltimes and freely consorting with other Limicoline species on the coastin winter especially the Redshank becomes very gregarious Itsfavourite haunts are mudflats and saltmarshes and it is here that thelargest flocks congregate but many odd birds frequent coasts of a morerocky character Redshanks are sprightly restless birds almostconstantly in motion when on the feed and scattering far and widerunning to and fro with dainty action wading through the little poolsand even occasionally swimming the shallows between one mudbank andanother They are ever alert and take wing as soon as danger threatensthe scattered flock soon forming into a compact mass again Between thetides Redshanks often collect on some mudbank where in a serriedthrong they keep up a confused babel of subdued cries as if all weretalking and none listening Its flight is rapid and most unsteadylookingthe black and white wings producing an idea of irregularitywhich is more imaginary than real Upon the coast the Redshank feeds onsandworms crustaceans molluscs and such like marine creatures butduring summer at its breedinggrounds worms insects groundfruits andberries are among the substances sought The call note of this wader isa loud shrill tyty most persistently repeated when the bird isexcited or alarmed whilst during the pairing season the love song ortrill is happily described by Professor Newtonwho has had exceptionalopportunities for observing this speciesas a constantly repeatedleeroleeroleero accompanied with many gesticulations as he hoversin attendance on the flight of his mate or with a slight change to adifferent key engages with a rival or again half angrily and halfpiteously complains of a human intruder on his chosen ground[3]The Redshank breeds somewhat locally in the marshy districts of ourislands perhaps most commonly in the lowlying eastern counties ofEngland and in Scotland It is one of the earliest waders to quit thecoast in spring and to retire to its nesting places which are fen andmarsh lands swampy moors and the boggy shores of lochs and tarnsNumbers of nests may be found within a small area of suitable groundand certain spots appear to be visited annually for breeding purposesin some cases even after the district by reclamation has lost itsoriginal marshy character The nest is slight but usually wellconcealed often beneath the shade of a tuft of grass or other herbageor in a hassock of sedge or under a little bush or tall weed Itconsists of a mere hollow scantily lined with a few bits of witheredgrass or leaves The four eggs are very pyriform in shape and vary frompale buff to dark buff handsomely and boldly blotched and spotted withrich dark brown paler brown and gray When disturbed the old birdsbecome very noisy and excited careering wildly to and fro and shouldthe young be hatched they become even more demonstrative and by variousantics seek to decoy an intruder away A return to the coast is made assoon as the young are sufficiently matured Many eggs of this bird aregathered and sold as Plovers eggs                              SANDERLINGDuring the period of its spring and autumn migrationsespecially thelatterthis pretty little bird the Tringa arenaria of ornithologistswho ignore the genus Calidris named first by Cuvier in 1800 andformally founded eleven years later by Illiger established as it is onsuch a trivial character all things considered as the absence of aminute and functionless hind toeis one of the commonest and most widelydistributed of Limicoline birds Comparatively few individuals remain onour coast to winter and these collect more especially on the southernbeaches In winter plumagethe dress in which it is most familiar toBritish observersthe Sanderling is a delicate silverygray above andpure white below but in the breeding season although the underpartsremain unchanged in colour the upper parts become mottled with chestnutand black Comparatively few Sanderlings reach the British coasts beforeAugust and the southward migration continues during September By themiddle of the latter month the bulk of the individuals has passed beyondour limits by the end of October but few remain although some of theseprolong their stay over the winter The return migration begins inApril and lasts over May into June There can be little doubt that theSanderling migrates by night Few birds are more trustful and engagingthan this pretty little Arctic stranger It not only frequents the longreaches of sand but mudflats estuaries and the creeks and streams insaltmarshes its favourite haunts however are the sands During itssojourn on our coast it consorts in flocks of varying size and veryfrequently a small party attach themselves to a larger gathering ofDunlins or Ringed Plovers Indeed for the society of the latter birdsthe Sanderling shows a strongly marked preference We may safely saythat during the migration period most large bunches of Ringed Ploverscontain a varying number of Sanderlings Its actions on the sand arevery similar to those of the Ringed Plover but it does not appear everto run in such fits and starts searching the ground moresystematically after the manner of a Stint or a Dunlin During highwater the Sanderling very often resorts to the higher shingle andskulks amongst the pebbles sometimes remaining unseen until nearlytrodden upon so closely does its white and gray dress resemble thestones among which it nestles Upon the dark muds and the wet shiningbrown sands it is much more conspicuous and there are few prettiersights along the shore than a scattered flock of Sanderlings standinghead towards the observer looking like so many white balls of animatedsnow It searches for its food by running to and fro about the beachoften on the very margin of the spent waves sometimes wading throughthe shallows or quickly dodging the foamflecked indriving surf Itsfood consists of sandworms crustaceans various insects and greatquantities of small molluscs In summer however it is almostexclusively insectivorous but also feeds on the buds of the Arcticsaxifrages The note of this bird during its sojourn on our coasts is ashrill whit but this is not very frequently or persistently utteredDuring winter the Sanderling is a great wanderer visiting parts ofAfrica Southern Asia Australia and South America but in the breedingseason its range seems confined to the Arctic regions But very littleis known of the nesting habits of the Sanderling and few of its eggsare in collections It is said to arrive at its Arctic haunts in May orearly June as soon as the water is free from ice and the ground bareof snow Its nesting haunts are the barren grounds and tundras near andthe beaches of the Arctic Ocean The nest is a mere hollow scantilylined with dry grass and leaves and the four eggs are buffisholive inground colour mottled and spotted with pale olivebrown and gray                                 KNOTThis species the Tringa canutus of Linnus and most modernornithologists is another of the Arctic migrants that pass the Britishcoasts regularly on their journeys and linger here in much smallernumbers over the winter Camden in 1607 appears to have been the firstauthor to connect the name of the Knot with King Canute but muchdifference of opinion exists as to the reason thereof Some authoritiesassert that it was in connection with the story of that king upon theseashore others and perhaps with greater reason because of the RoyalDanes great liking for its flesh The bird continued to be so closelyassociated with the king by successive writers that Linnus followedthem in applying the specific name of canutus to the Knot which isstill retained by the majority of naturalistsThe migrations of the Knot are very marked and regular The bird beginsto arrive on the British coasts early in August and from then to theend of October a nearly constant stream pours upon them reaching itsgreatest volume in September By far the greater number pass on to stillmore southern haunts but a sufficiently large portion remain to winteras to render the species one of the most familiar of Limicoline forms tohabitues of the coast The return migration begins on our coasts inApril and continues throughout May The principal haunts of the Knot inthe British Islands are situated on the eastern and southeasterncoasts Mudflats saltmarshes wide expansive sands and bigestuaries are the spots where Knots most do congregate for thesefurnish it with a constant supply of food Ten years ago I remembergreat numbers of Knots used to be caught in the flightnets on the Washduring October and November but the numbers of late years haveconsiderably decreased The Knot is not only very gregarious butsocial and often mixes with companies of other waders When feedingKnots keep close together generally all heading in the same directionand moving about quickly If the flock is a very large one some of theindividuals are almost constantly in the air flying over the heads oftheir companions and alighting again as if eager to get the first lookover the ground They are very wary when congregated in such largeassemblies easily flushed and often performing various evolutionsboth over the sands or the water before alighting again The Knot moreoften runs with a series of short quick steps than walks and it fliesboth rapidly and well After feeding the entire flock will often standfor a long time on a certain piece of the shore sleeping and preeningplumage but even on these occasions they are somewhat restless and itis rare to see all still at once They feed both by night and by dayThe callnote is seldom or never uttered although when on migration thebirds appear to be noisy enough crying incessantly to each other asthey fly along in the gloomBut little is known of the nesting economy of the Knot Its greatbreeding groundsthe nesting places of the vast flocks that passsouthwards in autumnstill remain undiscovered Where they are situatedit is useless to speculate Naturalists are ignorant of its eggs whichstill remain unknown in collections although the young in down havebeen obtained The Knot breeds in the high Arctic regions in the NorthPolar Basin mostly if not entirely above lat 80 and here it hasbeen met with during summer by various travellers The Knot is anotherbird remarkable for the great seasonal changes which its plumageundergoes In winter the plumage is ashgray above white below insummer the feathers of the upper parts become black margined withreddishbrown and mixed with white those of the lower parts rich bay orchestnut It has been remarked that the birds that winter on our coastsdo not assume such rich tints in summer as individuals that pass alongour coasts from more southern latitudes This is probably because thebirds wintering with us are younger individuals only the oldestpenetrating to the remoter winter home The Knot has a wide distributionduring winter including the Southern States and Mexico Africa and itis said Australia and New Zealand It is possible that in the lattercountries the Eastern Knotthe Tringa crassirostris of scienceisconfused with the present species                           CURLEW SANDPIPERThis pretty little species known to many as the Pygmy Curlew and tomodern naturalists by the scientific name of Tringa subarquata is oneof the rarest of the British Limicol It very closely resembles theKnot in the colour of its plumage and in the seasonal changes thatplumage undergoes but it is not much more than threefourths the sizeand has a curved Curlewlike bill This little Sandpiper like most ofits order is a migrant breeding in some yet undiscovered part of theArctic regions retiring southwards to winter in Africa various partsof southern Asia and in Australia It is during these journeys betweenthe Arctic regions and the tropics that it occurs on the British coastsa few individuals even remaining upon them all the winter through Asmight naturally be expected it is most frequently observed on the vaststretches of low coast on the eastern side of England it is also atolerably frequent visitor to the south coast even as far westwards asDevon and Cornwall A few Curlew Sandpipers arrive on our coasts inApril but the greater number pass along them in May stragglerslingering until June The return flight is noticed in August andconsists mostly of young birds the older ones reaching us duringSeptember and October The habits of this Sandpiper very closelyresemble those of the Dunlin in whose company the bird is veryfrequently found and from which it may readily be distinguished evenat a distance by its pure white upper tailcoverts It prefers coastsof a muddy rather than a sandy character haunting saltings estuariesand muds Here its actions are much the same as those of all theselittle sand birds it feeds both by day and night and often retiresduring high water to some wet land near the sea to wait the ebb Thefood of this species consists of crustaceans worms molluscs andinsects Its note is described as being louder than that of the DunlinAbsolutely nothing is known of the nidification of the Curlew Sandpiperand its egg has never yet been described It is to say the leastremarkable that some of the great breedingplaces of these Arctic birdshave not yet been discovereda fact that seems to suggest a vast area ofland somewhere in the vicinity of the Pole                                DUNLINOwing to the great seasonal changes of plumage which this SandpipertheTringa alpina of most naturalistsundergoes considerable confusionhas prevailed concerning it Linnus described birds of this species insummer plumage as distinct from individuals in winter plumage namingthem alpina and cinclus but Temminck and before him B Meyer withgreater discernment united both under the name of T variabilis Birdsin the two plumages have also received distinctive colloquial names insummer dress the bird is known as Dunlin in winter dress as thePurre Other local names of wide application to this species areOxbird Stint and Plovers Page the latter being derived fromthe habit of the Dunlin to accompany a Golden Plover flying to and froover the moors where the two species chance to be nesting Perhaps theWryneck has in like manner gained the name of Cuckoos Mate from itshabit of flying in attendance with that bird although some writersattribute the term to the fact of the two species appearing in ourcountry about the same timeThe Dunlin is absolutely the commonest Limicoline bird of the shore andcertainly the most widely dispersed It possesses the habit in commonwith so many other species of this order of retiring to moors to breedbut as soon as nesting duties are done it returns to the coast and forthe remainder of the year continues to reside upon it The Dunlins thatbreed in our islands represent but a very small portion of the vastnumber that winter on the British coasts The majority of these are frommore northern haunts winter migrants that haste away again with thereturn of spring During its residence on the coast the Dunlin isremarkably gregarious assembling often in flocks of thousands whichby preference seek such portions of the shore as are lowlying andmuddy Saltmarshes sloblands estuaries and creeks and vast expansesof mudas the Wash for instance are the favourite haunts of the DunlinThese large flocks of Dunlins are much more difficult to approach thansmaller gatherings or individual birds Dunlins are active little birdsalmost incessantly in motion running daintily about the muds by themargin of the waves or wading through the shallow tide pools Duringthe course of feeding a large flock will become widely scattered and itis remarkable how quickly the broken ranks reform There are few sightsso pretty along the saltmarshes and mudflats than a large flock ofDunlins in the act of performing those graceful aerial movements socharacteristic of this little bird during its winter sojourn upon thecoast The whole flock as with a single impulse will spread out like anet close up again apparently vanish appear black or like a flash ofsilver just as the birds turn and expose their dark or white plumage tothe light Sometimes the flock will head straight away down the coastpassing the observer with a rush and whirr of wings and a chorus ofpurring cries at other times a large flock will rise en masse fromthe muds pass out to sea a little way turn and go some distance alongthe shore come back again repeating the movement time after time everand anon appearing as though about to alight dipping and rising withmarvellous regularity No doubt these movements will recall to theobserver the gyrations of the autumn flocks of Starlings for there ismuch in common between the two During its sojourn upon the coast theDunlin feeds upon crustaceans sandworms molluscs and other smallmarine organisms but in summer insects grubs worms and groundfruitsare eaten The usual note of the Dunlin is harsh and resembles the wordpurrhence one of the birds trivial names during the breeding seasonit is a long drawn peezh In the pairing season when the maleindulges in certain aerial gambols he utters a trill which has beenlikened by some observers to the continuous ringing of a small bellIt is a rather remarkable fact that the Dunlin is the only species ofTringa that nests in the British Islands It breeds sparingly andlocally in Cornwall Devon and Somerset perhaps in Wales and thencenorthwards more generally over the remainder of England and inScotland up to the Shetlands Dunlins begin to move from the coasts inMarch and April and to resort to their breeding places which aresituated on the marshy moorlands and mountain swamps often at no greatdistance from the sea or at least from tidal waters The nest is a meredepression often in a tussock of grass or rushes or beneath a smallbush or even in a patch of thrift on bare sandy soil lined with a fewscraps of withered vegetation or enclosed with a few twigs or rootsThe four pyriform eggs are pale olive or pale brown blotched andspotted with reddish and blackishbrown and gray We remark the sameextraordinary difference between summer and winter plumage as we havealready observed in the Knot and some others In summer or breedingplumage the Dunlin is rich reddishbrown above striped with darkbrown lower breast or gorget deep black remainder of under partswhite In winter the upper parts are chiefly ashgray and the underparts white except the gorget which is now grayishbrown Outside theBritish Islands the Dunlin has a very wide distribution breeding notonly in the Arctic regions of both hemispheres but in many temperatelatitudes of the same in winter it is dispersed over North AfricaSouthern Asia the Southern States of America and the West Indies AtHeligoland flocks of Dunlins invariably indicate bad weather                           PURPLE SANDPIPERThis species the Tringa maritima of Brunnich and most modernnaturalists but erroneously identified with the T striata ofLinnus by certain recent writers on ornithology is a fairly commonand widely distributed bird on the British coasts during autumn andwinter The fact that a few odd birds are sometimes met with on ourshores during the summer has led to the suppositiontotallyunsubstantiated as yetthat the Purple Sandpiper may breed here Duringsome years this species is much more abundant than others a factperhaps due to exceptionally favourable breeding seasons The PurpleSandpiper readily distinguished from all other British Limicol by itsnearly black rump and upper tail coverts the purple gloss of its upperplumage and its yellow legsmakes its appearance with us early inSeptember and continues to arrive in increasing numbers during thatmonth and October and leaves us by the following May This Sandpiper ismost partial to a rocky coast where the huge boulders shelve down intothe water and large masses of rock and shingle are exposed at low tideIt may however be frequently observed in the company of KnotsDunlins and Ringed Plovers on the mudflats and sandy reaches Itusually seeks for its food close to the water running over the rocks aseach great wave breaks and retires even darting into the seethingdrifts of surf or coursing along the very edge of the rollers whereeach one threatens to annihilate it as it breaks upon the shoreOccasionally it may be seen to swim just outside the surf and whenflushed it sometimes even alights upon the sea Its food consists ofcrustaceans sandworms molluscs and insects and during summer ofseeds as well Although most of this food is obtained whilst the tide isdriving in the bird may be seen in quest of it at the ebb Itfrequently retires inland a little way or rests upon a rocky islet orpoint between the ebb and the flow of the tide Its flight is rapid andstraightforward and often accompanied by its shrill and quickly utteredteewit The Purple Sandpiper though social is never seen on ourcoasts in very large flocks and perhaps most frequently in pairs oralone In Norway however Collett states that it assembles in countlessflocks during the winter It is certainly one of the least shy of theLimicol and often permits of a close approach especially when aloneThe best known breedingplace of the Purple Sandpiper and one of itsmost southerly summer stations is on the Fares Other breeding placesare in Iceland in Norway Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla and on variousparts of the north Siberian coasts and in Arctic America to GreenlandIt arrives at its nesting grounds in May or June These are rarelysituated far from the sea although in the Fares it retires to thefells where it begins to nest even before the snow has all melted Thenest is but a shallow depression scantily lined with scraps of witheredvegetation and is made either close to the beach on broken groundcovered with a sparse vegetation or in some marshy spot on a hill inthe vicinity of the ocean The Purple Sandpiper may pair for life asthere is some evidence to show that it returns annually to certainspots to breed The four eggs are pale olive or buffishbrownbeautifully blotched and spotted mottled and streaked with blackishand reddishbrown and gray The sitting bird lingers long upon her nestsometimes remaining till almost trodden upon before she starts up andby feigning lameness seeks to draw the intruder away So closely is thePurple Sandpiper attached to the coast that even during the nestingseason when its duties call it more or less inland it always visitsthe shore to feed In summer plumage the upper parts are marked withrich chestnut and in winter dress the underparts are more spottedThere are certain other Limicoline birds found upon our coasts more orless frequently which at least deserve some passing notice but as theyare species that are merely fleeting visitors during their annualmigrations and never occur in sufficient number to form a dominantfeature in the birdlife of the shore they do not call for anylengthened description or minute study in a work which seeks only tosketch the more enduring avine characteristics of the British seaboardWe will deal with the commonest species first During the period of itsmigrations the Common Sandpiper or Summer Snipe Totanus hypoleucusis a pretty frequent visitor to the coast especially in thesouthwestern parts of England and there is strong reason to believethat a limited number may pass the winter thereon Its habits on theshore are very similar to those of the other Limicoline species Itbreeds commonly by the side of our inland waters and is certainly asits name implies the most abundant and the most widely dispersed of theBritish waders Another fairly regular and frequent visitor to theBritish littoral in spring and autumn is the Greenshank Totanusglottis It is most often met with on the lowlying eastern coastsbut it is said a few birds winter in Ireland The Greenshank breeds verylocally in Scotland and is best known to us at its more or less inlandnesting stations It may be distinguished by its white lower back andcentral upper tail coverts and nearly uniform gray secondaries Of evenrarer and more local appearance is the Wood Sandpiper Totanusglareola sometimes met with in small parties on our eastern andsouthern coasts whilst the Green Sandpiper Totanus ochropus is aless frequent visitor still This species is remarkable for its peculiarmode of nesting for instead of laying its eggs upon the groundas isthe almost universal custom of birds of this orderit places them in thedeserted nests of other birds in trees We must also not forget to givea passing reference to the singularlooking Ruff Machetes pugnaxDrainage of the fens has long banished the Ruff from its ancestralhaunts where it was once so common that a regular trade was carried onin netting and fattening it for the table The Ruff takes it name fromthe singular yet remarkably beautiful frill of elongated feathersthat during the love season adorns the neck of the male bird Theextraordinary variation in the colour of this fleeting sexual ornamentcan only be described as marvellous it being almost impossible to findtwo birds exactly alike This sexual development of feather ornamentseems closely associated with the polygamous habits of the Ruff thecock bird takes no share in family duties and during the pairing seasonwages endless battles with his rivals for the possession of the hensOdd birds frequent our coasts during the migration periods and lessfrequently during the winter Two species of Stintthe most diminutiveof the Sandpipersalso deserve a brief allusion The first and mostfrequent visitor is the Little Stint Tringa minuta most numerous onits autumn passage south It is chiefly seen on the eastern coastlinebut is a visitor to the Solway district The Little Stint breeds in theArctic regions of Europe and West Siberia and is a late migrant inspring seldom seen in any numbers on our coasts before May Itfrequents whilst with us mudflats saltmarshes and long reaches ofsand and often joins the Dunlins in quest of food Its stay with us isbrief especially in spring and even in autumn most have gone awaybefore October It may be distinguished by its small size wing under 4inches in length tapering bill and black legs and feet The secondspecies Temmincks Stint Tringa temmincki is a larger bird thanthe foregoing and readily distinguished from all other Tring by itswhite outer tail feathers It is much rarer in its appearance too andas usual most frequent on the lowlying eastern coastline even thisdistrict is beyond the more general limits of its migrations It is alsonot so maritime in its haunts and seems to migrate along more inlandroutes                  Guillemots Razorbill and Puffin[Illustration GUILLEMOT AND RAZORBILL Chapter iii]                              CHAPTER III                   GUILLEMOTS RAZORBILL AND

those which are included in the present chapter They areinseparably associated with the sea they form one of the mostinteresting features of marine life whether in summer when they crowdin countless hosts at their breeding stations upon the cliffs andislands or in winter when they spread themselves far and wide over thewaste of waters From whatever point of view we study them they areintensely interesting birdsThe Auks as they are collectively termed form the small yetwelldefined family Alcid Although the Auks are a specialised groupsystematists pretty generally agree in associating them more or lessclosely with the Divers the Grebes the Gulls and the Limicol Auksare webfooted birds with no hind toe with the legs placed far backand the bill subject to great variation in size and in some speciespresenting considerable change in appearance according to season Allthe Auks have comparatively short and narrow wings in the recentlyextinct Great Auk these were incapable of supporting the bird in theair and the tail is remarkably short in some species being scarcelyperceptible under ordinary circumstances The Auks are exclusivelyconfined to the north temperate and polar regions of the NorthernHemisphere and by far the greater number of species inhabit theNorthern Pacific They number some thirty species The prevailingcolours of the Auks are black and white none of them are showy birdsbut some species are remarkable for their eccentric nuptial plumes andfor the brilliancy of colour of the bill The Auks are thoroughlyaquatic and not adapted in any way for a terrestrial existence Theyswim well dive with marvellous skill and save during the incubationperiod pass most of their time on the sea None of the species areremarkable for any great migration flights as a rule they wander littlefrom their high northern homes They are all gregarious birds breedingin companies wherever possible Some species undergo but little changein their appearance between summer or winter plumage others are moreremarkable in this respect During the breeding period some speciesresort to lofty cliffs washed by the sea others burrow into the groundMany species make no nest whatever but others form slight structures inwhich to deposit their eggs The young of the Auks are hatched coveredwith down assuming their first plumage in a few weeks Adult Auks moultin September the difference in the colour of the plumage peculiar tothe pairing season apparently being entirely due to a change in the huequite irrespective of a moult The complete change from white tobrownishblack observed prior to the breeding season on the necks andheads of Guillemots and Razorbills is very curious and interestingAccording to the observations of Herr Gtke the shafts of the feathersare the first portions in which the black appears yet almost at thesame time this colour is seen in the form of minute specks on the lowerthird of the feathers quickly spreading into crescentic markings andultimately covering the entire surface Half a dozen species areBritish Of these four breed more or less abundantly in our area andthe other two are irregular winter visitors The now extinct GreatAukthe largest known representative of the familyformerly bred incertain parts of the British Islands but alas is now only known as afast receding tradition We will now proceed to a short study of theseBritish Auks                               GUILLEMOTOf all the various sea birds that cluster on the cliffs of Albion thisspecies the Uria troile of most modern ornithologists is by far thecommonest and of the present family of birds the most widelydistributed During summer it may be met with in colonies of varyingnumbers here and there on most of our rocky coasts from the ScillyIslands to the Shetlands from Flamborough Head in the east to theBlaskets in the west Not perhaps so familiar to the seaside wandereras the Gull whose rial habits bring it more frequently into noticethe Guillemot nevertheless is a seldom absent feature of marine birdlife It is gregarious and social at all times but joins into greatestcompanies during the season of reproduction When the nesting season haspassed the birds spread themselves more generally along the coast andout at sea and it is at such times that they are most ubiquitousBetween October and March the Guillemot may often be met with swimmingclose in shore in quiet bays and especially in the neighbourhood offishing villages On these occasions it is not particularly shy andwill allow a sufficiently close scrutiny but it is ever wary diving atthe least alarm and appearing again well out of danger The Guillemotswims well and buoyantly it also dives with remarkable agility andobtains most of its food whilst doing so The Guillemots are rarely seenupon the land after the young have quitted their birthplaces they spendtheir entire time upon the sea seeking shelter during rough weather inbays or under the lee of headlands but not unfrequently great numbersperish in a gale their dead bodies strewing the coast where the tidehas cast them ashore Except during the breeding season the Guillemotflies very little but during that period it often feeds far from itsrocky haunts and may then be seen especially at eventide flying inlittle bunches or in compact flocks swiftly and silently just abovethe waves returning to them The food of this bird is almostexclusively composed of fish especially such small species as pilchardsand sprats it is also extremely partial to the fry of the herring andthe pollack Few birds are more expert at catching fish than theGuillemot it dives after them and chases them beneath the surface withmarvellous speed and unerring certainty In this chase of fish itsometimes comes to grief by getting entangled in the driftnets TheGuillemot is a remarkably silent bird I have repeatedly been amongstthousands of these birds both at sea and on the rock stacks where theybreed and the only sound I have ever heard them utter is a lowgrunting noise My experience has been chiefly confined to the earlierpart of the breeding season and the autumn and winter months It wouldappear though that when the young are partly grown the birds becomemore noisy for Gtke describes their cries at the breedingstations asa confused noise of a thousand voices the calls of the parentbirdsarrrrr orrrrr errrrr and mingled with these thecountless tiny voices of their young offspring on the face of thecliffirrrridd irrrridduttered in timid and anxiousaccents I should here remark that the Guillemot never flies over theland never flies inland from the rocks but always when disturbedunerringly makes for the sea which is almost if not quite as much itselement as the airThe actions of the Guillemot are interesting enough upon the sea fewsights being prettier than a number of these birds busily engaged incapturing their finny food but the most attractive scenes in the lifeof this bird are to be witnessed at its breeding places Formerly thesewere much more numerous than is now the case especially in England butthere on the southern coast line notably so many a large colony hasdisappeared for ever and many another has been sadly reduced innumbers The distribution of the Guillemot becomes much more localduring summer the birds crowding in vast numbers to certaintimehonoured spots Fortunately some of these still remain fairlyaccessible to the lover of birds One of the most famous breedingstations is at the Farne Islands another on the cliffs at Bemptonwhilst less noted places are in the Isle of Wight the Scilly Islandsand the coasts of Devon and Cornwall The great number of local names bywhich the Guillemot is known round our coasts speak to its formerabundance Lavy Marrock Murre Diver and Willockthe latterapplicable to the youngmay be mentioned as a few of the best known Thebirds congregate at their old accustomed haunts in Spring withremarkable regularity often punctually arriving on the same day foryears in succession At Heligoland and certainly other placesGuillemots return to their nesting places from time to time during thewinter appearing in the morning for a little while just as Rooks arewont to do at the nest trees The Guillemot rears its young on the faceof the lofty ocean cliffs or on the flat tops of rock stacks Cliffswith plenty of ledges and hollows are preferred and in such chosenspots the birds crowd so closely that at some stations the wonder ishow each individual can possibly find room to incubate its egg or evensecure a standing place in the general throng There can be little doubtthat in such crowded spots as the Pinnacles many of the eggs neverreach maturity The Guillemot makes no nest of any kind but lays itssingle large pearshaped egg on any suitable ledge or in any availablehollow where it can be tolerably safe from toppling over into the seaThere are few more stirring sights in the birdworld than a large colonyof Guillemots I still retain the vivid impressions made upon my mind bythe vast hordes of these birds at St Kilda at the Farne Islands andelsewhere Even whilst I write I can once more see the strugglingquarrelling rowdy hosts of Guillemots that crowd the famousPinnacles still see them pouring off in endless streams headlonginto the water as I prepared to scale their haunt Once more memoryrecalls and paints in vivid scene the beetling St Kildan cliffs withtheir rows and rows of whitebreasted Guillemots sitting tier upontier upwards and upwards towards the dark blue sky my tiny boattossing like a cork on the wild Atlantic swell and the countless swarmsof Guillemots swimming in the sea around me hastening to the cliffs orreturning from them beaten off by more fortunate possessors of a placeThe Guillemot lays a single egg without making a nest of any kind forits reception If this egg be taken however the bird will lay a secondor a third and advantage is taken of this fact by those persons thatgather them for a livelihood The egg of no other known bird varies tosuch an extraordinary extent as that of the Guillemot whilst few ifany are more beautiful Greens browns yellows pale blues and whiteform the principal ground colour the markings which take the form ofspots blotches streaks and zones are composed of browns grays andpinks of every possible tint One variety is white intricately lacednetted and streaked with pink another is a beautiful green streakedin the same manner with yellow light brown or nearly black others ofvarious ground colours are zoned with blotches or marked withfantasticshaped spots and rings Some eggs of the Guillemot closelyresemble those of the Razorbill but may be distinguished by theyellowishwhite interior of the shell when held up to the lightThere has been much controversy as to the way in which the Guillemotchicks reach the water from their lofty birthplace Some writers assertthat the parent bird carries them down to the sea on its back on theother hand Gtke maintains that the chicks tumble off the ledges intothe water being enticed to do so by the old birds swimming on the seabeneath the cliffs He writes in its distress the little chick triesto get as near as possible to the mother waiting for it below and keepstripping about on the outermost ledge of rock often of no more than afingers breath until it ends by slipping off and turning two orthree somersaults lands with a faint splash on the surface of thewater both parents at once take charge of it between them and swim offwith it towards the open sea This is the only way in which I have seenthis change of habitat of the young birds accomplished during somefifty summers As soon as the young are sufficiently matured the seain the vicinity of the breedingstations is deserted and the coloniesdisperse far and wide From this time forward to the followingbreedingseason the Guillemots movements are to a certain extentunknown As Professor Newton justly asks[4] What becomes of themillions of Guillemots and other Auks that breed in northern latitudesThe birds that are met with round the coasts of temperate Europe andelsewhere bear no proportion whatever to the mighty hosts whoseposition and movements remain unrevealed At present the only feasibleexplanation seems to be that the birds during the nonbreedingseasonare scattered in quest of sustenance over many thousands of square milesof water in summer only is their vast abundance palpable when all aregathered into a comparatively small areaIn connection with the Guillemot mention should be made of the RingedGuillemot the Uria ringvia of Latham It only differs from the CommonGuillemot in having a narrow white band round the eye which isprolonged into a streak for some distance behind and below it It may beseen breeding in company with the commoner form and is not known todiffer in its habits Whether it be a distinct speciesas Gtkestatesor merely a variety of the Common Guillemot as many naturalistsbelieve still remains to be decided                         BRUNNICHS GUILLEMOTThis Guillemot the Uria bruennichi of Sabine and most modern writersis a very rare visitor to the British Islands its home being in theArctic regions from Greenland possibly to the Liakoff Islands off thecoasts of northern Siberia It deserves a passing notice for it ispossible that it occurs in British waters more frequently than isgenerally supposed It is a perceptibly stouter bird than the CommonGuillemot and has the base of the upper mandible pale gray In itshabits and economy it is not known to differ in any special manner fromthe better known species of which it is the Arctic form                            BLACK GUILLEMOTThis species the Dovekey or Greenland Dove of northern mariners theTysty of the Shetlanders and the Uria grylle of naturalists is byfar the most local of the Auks that are indigenous to the BritishIslands During the breeding season it is only known to frequent oneEnglish locality the Isle of Man but in Scotland it is prettygenerally distributed along the western and northern coasts includingSt Kilda the Orkneys and the Shetlands Its chief resorts in Irelandare on the north and west coasts The difference between the summer andwinter plumage of this little bird is most extraordinary In spring itassumes a rich black dress glossed with green except a patch of whiteon the wings in winter it is uniformly mottled black and white thelegs and feet are bright coral red With us the Black Guillemot isstrictly marine in its haunts but in Spitzbergen it was found breedingmore than a mile inlanda habit very different from any it displays withus In its actions it very closely resembles its larger allies Likethem it is an expert diverI have seen it dive repeatedly at the flashof a gun and thus escape the shot It is on the whole a more trustfulbird often permitting a near approach and frequently remaining on thesurface until the boat is about to pass over it when it will dive andreappear quite unconcernedly a short distance away out of danger ThisGuillemot often feeds quite close in shore At St Kilda I used to seeparties of this species every evening fishing under the cliffs but onthe other hand I have often met with them searching for food many milesfrom land The Black Guillemot is nothing near so gregarious as theCommon Guillemot nor does it appear to wander so far from its breedingplaces to feed It is partially nocturnal in its habits in summerfeeding well into the dusk and during winter seldom comes upon theland sleeping out at sea Although capable of flying swiftly it alwaysprefers to escape danger by diving it swims lightly usually sittinghigh in the water but it has the power of sinking itself more than halfbelow the surface when apparently alarmed Black Guillemots may often beseen in strings flying to and from a distant feeding place hurryingalong close to the water their short wings beating rapidly andrendered very conspicuous by the broad white bar The food of thisGuillemot is largely composed of the fry of the herring and thecoalfish but other small fishes are eaten as are crustaceans andvarious marine insects I have never heard the Black Guillemot utter asound beyond a low grunting but its note has been described as awhining sound that of the young birds being more shrill In chasing itsfinny prey under the water the Black Guillemot displays astonishingpowers darting to and fro aided by its wings and feet During winterthese birds wander southwards and then they may sometimes be seen offour more frequented coastsThe Black Guillemot retires to its breedingstations in May These aresituated in our islands on rocky headlands and islands and on oceancliffs Here its colonies are never very large and often muchscattered It very probably pairs for life and resorts often to oneparticular spot year after year The bird deposits its eggs in a hole orcranny of the cliffs occasionally in the clefts amongst fallen rocks atthe foot of the precipice or on rockstrewn downs sloping to the seaIt makes no nest and the eggs rest upon the bare ground or rock TheBlack Guillemot and its allies are remarkable for the fact that theireggs are two or three in number in all other members of the Alcid theeggs never exceed one This peculiarity has induced some systematists torestrict the genus Uria to the Black Guillemots alone The BlackGuillemot lays two eggs much smaller than and not so pearshaped asthose of the Common Guillemot cream buff or pale green in groundcolour blotched and spotted with rich dark brown paler brown andgray The young chicks are said not to repair to the sea at so early anage as those of the preceding birds and to be soon deserted by theirparents after doing so congregating in flocks by themselves                               RAZORBILLThis bird the Alca torda of Linnus and ornithologists generally iswidely confused with the Common Guillemot and many local names referindiscriminately to eachsuch as Murre Marrot and Diver It is readilydistinguished from the Guillemots by its much deeper bill crossed by awhite line at its centre and by a narrow yet very conspicuous whitestripe extending from the base of the bill to the eye Otherwise theRazorbill closely resembles the Guillemot in appearance both in itssummer and winter plumage It is widely distributed round the Britishcoasts breeding in most situations where the cliffs are sufficientlysuitable but is much less abundant in the south and is nowhereperhaps so numerous as the Guillemot During the nonbreeding season itbecomes more generally scattered and may then be met with althoughever sparingly in the seas round most parts of the British coastlineIts actions in the water are almost precisely the same as those of theGuillemot Like that bird it may be seen swimming to and fro sittinghighly and lightly on the water often permitting a very close approachespecially in districts where it is not much harassed by the shooter Itdives with the same marvellous celerity as the Guillemot pursuing itsprey through the water often at a considerable depth as readily as theswallows chase an insect through the air It is a very pretty sight towatch the Razorbill in quest of food This may often be done from thesummits of the cliffs but certainly to better advantage from a boat inwhich the birds can be more closely approached and consequently betterobserved A Razorbill in the water is a remarkably striking if not anactually pretty bird He sits so lightly riding buoyantly as a cork onthe swell turning his head from side to side as the boat approachesswimming rapidly before it and often nonchalantly dipping his head intothe water and throwing a shower over his upper plumage The boat comestoo near at last and the bird with a scarcely audible or perceptiblesplash disappears into the water Several moments afterwards he risesagain to the right or left ahead or astern and the salt spray rollsoff his plumage glinting like diamonds in the sun Should fish beplentiful the birds are diving and rising again incessantly the time ofabsence depending upon the depth descended or the length of the chaseThe Razorbill ever seems to use its wings with reluctance on theseoccasions always keeping out of harms way by diving or swimming It iscapable of rapid flight though and may often be seen in strings orskeins hastening along just above the waves to or from a favouritefishing place The Razorbill is gregarious enough during summer but inwinter it is most frequently seen in small parties or often alone Italso goes some distance from land where should a gale overtake itgreat numbers often perish as their dead bodies washed up on the coastsadly testify The food of the Razorbill is largely composed of fryespecially of the herring but many other small fishes are capturedtogether with crustaceans and other small marine creatures The bird sofar as my experience extends never seeks its food upon the shore andobtains most if not all of it by diving The Razorbill is a remarkablysilent bird the only sound I have ever heard it utter has been a lowgrunting This note is uttered both in summer and winter on the rocksas well as on the seaIn May the Razorbill gives up its roaming nomad life upon the sea andcollects in numbers at the oldaccustomed breedingplaces These aresituated on the ocean cliffs such as contain plenty of nooks andcrannies being preferred to those of a more walllike character It ispossibly due to this that the Razorbills colonies are never so crowdedas those of the Guillemot and that the birds are more scattered alongthe coastline There can be little doubt that the Razorbill pairs forlife As a proof of this I have known a Puffin burrow resorted toyearly whilst eggs possessing certain peculiarities of form and colourhave repeatedly been taken from one nook in the cliffs years and yearsin succession Like the Guillemot the Razorbill makes no nest but laysits single egg in a crevice or hole in the cliffs or far under stacksof rock poised one upon another where to reach it is an utterimpossibility Like most birds that breed in such situations theRazorbill is much more loth to quit its egg than the Guillemot oftenremaining upon it until captured When alarmed by man the birds may beheard scrambling amongst the crevices and uttering their grunting criesof remonstranceThe single egg of the Razorbill though not displaying a tithe of thevariety observed in that of the Guillemot is a remarkably handsomeobject The ground colour varies through every tint between white andreddishbrown and the handsome large blotches and spots are darkliverbrown reddishbrown gray or grayishbrown No shade of green orblue is ever apparent upon them externally but the shells when held upto the light have the interior of a clear peagreen tinta characterwhich readily serves to distinguish them from such eggs of the Guillemotthat resemble them in external colour If the first egg be taken thebird will lay another and this process may be repeated several timesbut on no occasion is more than one chick reared in the season It issaid that the young of this species remain upon the cliffs for a muchlonger period than the chicks of the Guillemot and that they eventuallyfly or flutter down to the sea never revisiting the rocks The parentwill sometimes dive with its offspring just as the Little Grebe willdo                              LITTLE AUKThis species the Rotche of Arctic navigators and the Mergulus alleof ornithology is but an irregular visitor to British seas duringautumn and winter and as it seldom comes near the land under ordinarycircumstances is not a very familiar bird to the seaside observerExceptionally severe weather not unfrequently drives this little birdfar inland In its general colouration the Little Auk closely resemblesthe Razorbill but it is less than half the size and has a considerableamount of white on the wings This curious little species congregates inincredible numbers at certain spots in the Arctic regions to breedBeechey at the beginning of the present century records that he hasseen nearly four millions of these birds on the wing at one timeColonies of the Little Auk are known in Nova Zembla FranzJosef Land Spitzbergen Grimsey Island to the north of Iceland and thecoasts of Greenland Like all its larger allies the Little Auk isthoroughly pelagic in its habits apparently only visiting the land tobreed living on the sea for the remainder of the year It is welladapted for its lengthened sojourn upon the waters It swims well andbuoyantly sitting rather low flies rapidly when inclined dives withas much ease as a fish and sleeps quite safely and comfortably upon thewaves Voyagers in the Arctic regions have met with flocks of LittleAuks at most times of the year often far from land and occasionallycrowding upon the masses of floating ice All observers agree indescribing it as a somewhat noisy bird and its specific name of alleis said to resemble its ordinary note There is scarcely a winter thatthe Little Auk is not obtained in varying numbers off the Britishcoasts more frequently of course in the northern districts but underordinary circumstances it keeps too far off the land to be observed andoccurs most plentifully during periods of continued storm Where theuncounted millions of Little Auks winter that are known to breed in theArctic regions washed by the Atlantic is still an unsolved problemThe few that are observed are as nothing in comparison with the numbersthat crowd at certain spots during summer Perhaps it is because thearea of distribution is so wide in winter and comparatively speakingso restricted during summer The food of the Little Auk consists largelyof minute crustaceans and possibly of small fish The bird is said toresort to the vicinity of fishing fleets to pick up the refuse thrownoverboardIn May the Little Auk resorts to the land to breed It is eminentlygregarious and some of its colonies consist of an almost incrediblenumber of birds Curiously enough its breeding places are not always bythe sea some of them being situated a considerable distance from thecoast Sloping rockcovered banks at the foot of the cliffs seem to bepreferred to the cliff themselves A favourite situation is on thesloping ground below a range of cliffs where the surface is coveredwith stones and rock fragments that have during succeeding agescrumbled from the precipices towering above Here in cavities worn bywind and storm beneath large stones and rock fragments or in varioushollows and holes under the fallen dbris the Little Auk deposits itssingle pale greenishblue egg out of reach of the Arctic foxes thatprowl about the colony in quest of prey The actions of the Little Aukat its nesting colony seem to be very similar to those of the Puffinwhen breeding on slopes as for instance on the island of Doon one ofthe St Kilda group                                PUFFINOf all the Auks the present species the Alca arctica of Linnus andthe Fratercula arctica of modern ornithologists is not only the bestknown but the most readily distinguished The Puffin cannot readily bemistaken for any other bird along the coast his big brightly colouredbeak and comical facial expression being never failing marks of hisidentity In the colour of its plumage the Puffin somewhat closelyresembles the Guillemot or the Little Auk only the throat and the sidesof the head are white The most striking feature in the Puffin is itsbeaka deep laterally flattened coultershaped organ banded withblue yellow and red singularly grooved and embossed with hornyexcrescences although these latter are only assumed for the pairingseason and are cast again when the breeding period is over Unlike mostbirds therefore the Puffin displays his wedding ornaments on his beakAnd this singular peculiarity appears to be common to various otherspecies more distantly allied yet undoubtedly of close affinity withthe English Puffin Many local names have been applied to the Puffin inconsequence of its singular bill Bottlenose Coulterneb and SeaParrot may be mentioned as the most commonly used Like most if notall members of the Auk family the Puffin is not seen much near theland after the breeding season has passed Indeed it is very doubtfulwhether the bird ever voluntarily seeks the coast after it leaves it inearly autumn with its young continued gales and storms willoccasionally drive a bird even far inland whilst rough weather oftencauses it to perish at sea its remains being sometimes washed up inquantities Its actions on the water are almost precisely the same asthose of the Guillemot and Razorbill It is an adept swimmer amarvellous diver it flies well and strongly especially during thesummer where I have seen it in swarms drifting round and round thehighest peaks of its island haunt on apparently nevertiringwing Atthe summit of the cliffs its powers of flight may often be witnessed toperfection At St Kilda I have watched it gracefully poising itself inthe air its narrow wings beating rapidly and its two orangecolouredlegs spread out behind acting as a rudder Of all the Auk tribe so faras my experience goes the Puffin flies the most The Puffin feedsprincipally upon small fish especially sprats and the fry of largerfishes it also eats crustaceans and various marine insects It divesoften to a great depth and is remarkably active beneath the surfacewhen on the water it generally tries to escape from danger by divingSometimes the Puffin may be seen close ashore during winter but neverin any abundanceThe Puffin becomes by far the most interesting at its breeding placesThe regularity of its appearance at these has often been remarked Inmany localities it not only arrives punctually on a certain day butretires from them in autumn with its young almost as regularly In someplaces Puffins arrive on the land to breed as early as March in othersnot before April in others yet again not before the beginning of MayWith the exception of the south and east coasts of Englandwhere it isonly sparingly and locally distributedthe Puffin from Flamboroughnorthwards is widely and generally dispersed In some places itsnumbers are almost incredible as for instance at Lundy Island theFarne Islands on some of the Hebrides and St Kilda There is a veryinteresting colony of Puffins established amongst the walls of theancient fortress on the Bass Rock but so far as my experience goes thecolony on St Kilda stands unrivalled and at a very moderatecomputation must consist of many millions of birds The Puffin mostprobably pairs for life and returns time out of mind to certainfamiliar spots to rear its offspring In most places the bird makes itsscanty nest in a burrow which it excavates itself but in somelocalities rabbit holes are frequently made use of In some localitieshowever the bird makes a nest in a crevice of the cliffs or beneathheaps of rocks By the end of April both birds are engaged in scrapingout this burrow if circumstances demand it which often extends forseveral yards in the loamy soil sometimes sloping downwards sometimestortuous sometimes nearly straight At the end or elsewhere in somecases the slight nest of dry grass and a few feathers is formedOccasionally several pairs occupy one burrow each pair enlarging aportion of it for their own requirements into a kind of chamber whilstmany of the burrows have several openings and are evidently the work ofsuccessive years In this rude nest the hen Puffin lays a single eggdull white sometimes tinged with blue or gray and obscurely spottedwith pale brown and gray Contact with the earth in the burrow and withthe wet feet of the sitting bird soon discolours this egg and rendersit almost like a ball of peat in appearance When disturbed at theirbreeding places such Puffins as may chance to be outside the holes soonfly off to the sea and join the hosts of birds that swarm in the waternear every breeding station Those in the burrows however remainallowing themselves to be dragged out without making any attempt toescape Great caution and gloves are recommended for the Puffin resentsintrusion and bites fiercely being able to inflict a nasty cut with itspowerful beak and sharp clawsI still retain the most vivid impressions on my visit to the grandcolony of Puffins on Doon one of the St Kilda group Every availableplace is honeycombed with their holes the ground cannot affordaccommodation for all and numbers of birds have to seek nesting placesunder the masses of rock lying on the grasscovered hillsides or in thecrannies of the cliffs at the summit of the island As soon as we hadfairly got ashore and begun to walk up the slopes the Puffins in adense whirling bewildering host swept downwards to the sea or rosehigh in air to circle above our heads in the direst alarm It seemed asif the whole face of the island were slipping away from under me justlike flakes of shale down a quarry side Not a single bird so far as Icould ascertain uttered a note but the whirring noise of the millionsof rapidly beating wings sounded like the distant rush of wind But evenDoon does not harbour so many Puffins as find a home on the face of themighty cliff Connacher and when we fired a gun and disturbed them fromthis noble precipice it seemed as though the face of the entire cliffwas falling outwards into the Atlantic the enormous cloud of birdsoverpowering one with its magnificence As soon as the young are rearedthe land is deserted and the wandering pelagic life resumedIn connection with this species mention may be made of its former reputeas an article of food Old records inform us that the young Puffins wereregularly gathered by the owners of the breedingplaces and were salteddown for future food Gesner and Caius assert that the Puffin wasallowed to be eaten during Lent probably because in the words ofCarew of its coming nearest to fish in taste More than two hundredyears ago Ligon in his History of Barbadoes complains of the illtaste of Puffins which he had received from the Scilly Islands once agreat centre of exportation of these birds and asserts that this kindof food is only for servants The taste for salted and dried Puffinhowever still lingers in the land for at St Kilda vast numbers arecaught and so preserved by the natives for food Dried Puffin perhapsa twelvemonth old is one of the few delicacies of the island whilstthe feathers help materially to pay the rent                    Divers Grebes and Cormorants[Illustration GREAT NORTHERN DIVER Chapter iv]                              CHAPTER IV                    DIVERS GREBES

completely pelagic as the Auks and yetaccording to season many of them are interesting features in thebirdlife of the coast Unfortunately for the summer visitor to theseaside the Divers will be absent They are birds that resort chieflyto inland districts to rear their young or are only known as wintervisitors to the British Coasts The Divers form a small but wellmarkedfamily known as Colymbid consisting of a single genus Colymbus intowhich are grouped the four species that are now known to science TheDivers are allied to the Auks on the one hand to the Grebes on theother although systematists are not yet agreed upon the degree of theirrelationship United these three families form Dr Sclaters orderPygopodes In every way the Divers are remarkably well fitted for anaquatic life Their strong tarsi are laterally compressed a form bestsuited for cleaving the water the hind toe is well developed and onthe same plane as the rest the feet are webbed the bill is longstraight spearshaped and conical admirably adapted for seizing thefinny prey the wings are comparatively short yet capable of bearingthe bird at great speed the tail is short and fairly developed TheDivers in nuptial plumage are remarkably handsome birds the neck beingstriped or richly marked and the upper plumage beautifully spotted oradorned with white bars They are all more or less gregarious birdsduring winter and well marked social tendencies are displayed in somespecies during the breeding season Their migrations if comparativelyshort are pronounced and regular The young are hatched covered withdown able to swim with ease almost immediately Adults moult in autumnand assume their nuptial plumage in wintera period doubtless when theypairthe winter plumage thus being carried for a short time YoungDivers carry their first plumage through the winter until the followingspring not moulting in December with their parents when they assumetheir summer plumage but the nuptial ornaments are not so brilliant incolour as in adults Whether the vernal change in colour is effectedwithout moulting as in the Auks and some of the Limicol appears notto have yet been ascertained All the species of Divers are visitors tothe British Islands but only two breed in them and one is anexceptionally irregular straggler This is the largest of them all theWhitebilled Diver Colymbus adamsi and a species apparentlycircumpolar in its distribution The Divers are all birds of thenorthtemperate or Arctic regions during summer in winter their rangeis much more extended almost reaching to the northern tropics Withthis brief rsum of their more salient characteristics we will nowproceed to a more detailed examination of their economy                         GREAT NORTHERN DIVERThis species the Colymbus glacialis of Linnus and of ornithologistsgenerally is in its breeding plumage one of the handsomest of Britishbirds Its chief characteristics are its large sizeabout that of aGooseblack head and neck double semicollars of white and blackvertical stripes and black upper parts marked with white spots ofvarying size and arranged in a series of belts Whether it actuallybreeds within our limits has not yet been absolutely determinedalthough evidence is forthcoming that seems to point to the factUnfortunately for the seaside student of bird life the Great NorthernDiver is only known as a winter visitor At that season however it maybe met with pretty frequently off the British coasts the young birdsespecially venturing into our bays and creeks and estuaries olderindividuals as a rule keeping further out to sea Adult birds arehowever often observed near the coasts of South Devonshire andCornwall I have known them linger in the waters near here until thesummer has been well advanced Young birds of this species in the brownand white dress characteristic of immaturity may often be seen quietlyfishing under the cliffs notably in Tor Bay One very remarkable thingabout this Diver is its singular habit of immersing the body to such adepth that the back is quite under water It often so sinks itself whenmenaced by danger and then almost out of sight swims away with greatspeed If pursuit is still continued all but the neck is sunk below thesurface and finally if hotly pressed the bird will disappearentirely and swim along under water at a speed absolutely astonishingGtke records that this Diver when chased by a boat under thesecircumstances will dive and allow the boat to pass over it risingagain in the rear of it a habit which my own observations of the birdcompletely confirm How this act of immersion without apparent effortis accomplished remains a mystery and offers a problem in animalmechanics by no means easy of solutionThe Great Northern Diver is rarely seen on land perhaps never exceptduring the breeding season Its movements on shore are ungainly in theextreme the legs being placed so far back that the bird can only pushitself along in a crawling sort of a way it is equally rarely seen inthe air and apparently only uses its wings to fly when performing itsannual migrations How the species still retains the function of flightat all seems almost a mystery but perhaps the constant use of the wingsin the water keeps them to a standard of efficiency This Diver is oneof the least gregarious and save on passage is rarely met with innumbers greater than a pair It seems to be the rule for odd pairs totake up their residence in certain spots during the breeding seasonafter that period the bird is usually met with solitary and the youngindividuals unlike so many others that evince strong gregariouspropensities for the most part wander about alone This Diver likemost big birds is shy and wary although I have repeatedly watched itfrom the cliffs in Tor Bay evincing little concern at my presence Asmay be gathered from the foregoing remarks the Great Northern Diver is aproficient in the art of diving and is said to be able to remain aslong as eight minutes beneath the surfacea period of time which seemsincredible The depth to which it sometimes descends is also enormousithas been captured in a net thirty fathoms from the surface The food ofthis Diver is almost if not absolutely composed of fish During thenonbreeding season Divers are not particularly noisy birds but attheir nestingplaces the cries they utter are both loud and startlingdescribed by some listeners as similar to the screams of torturedchildren as shrieks of maddened laughter or as weird and melancholyhowls by othersIt is a somewhat remarkable fact that the Great Northern Diver breedsnowhere in Europe except on Iceland It is an American species andnests from Greenland westwards to Alaska south of the Arctic circle tothe more northern of the United States It reaches its breedinggroundsin pairs towards the end of May as soon as the northern waters are freefrom ice Its favourite nesting places are secluded tarns and lakes andan island is always selected if possible doubtless from motives ofsecurity The nestalways made upon the groundvaries a good deal insize according to the local requirements On wet marshy ground it islarge and composed of a heap of half rotten sedges rushes reeds andsuch like vegetation lined with dry bits of broken reed and witheredgrass On drier and barer situations it is little more than a hollow inthe sand or hard ground with perhaps a few bits of dry grass forlining The birds are very alert and watchful whilst nesting as iffully conscious of their comparative difficulty in escaping from dangeron the land One bird is generally on the look out whilst the othersits and at the least danger the alarm is given and the incubatingpartner shuffles off in a floundering way to the water A path is soonthus worn from the nest to the lake The eggs are almost invariably twoelongated and varying in ground colour from russetbrown toolivebrown spotted sparingly with blackishbrown and paler brown Whenthe young are sufficiently matured the inland haunts are deserted andthe nomad wandering life upon the sea resumed                         BLACKTHROATED DIVERThe present species of Diver much smaller than the preceding theColymbus arcticus of Linnus and most other writers is the rarest ofthe three that visit the British Islands regularly and perhaps we mightalso say the most beautiful in nuptial dress All its showy colours andpatterns however are on the head neck and upper parts the undersurface being white The head is gray the throat patch black abovewhich is a semicollar of white striped vertically with black the sidesof the neck are also striped with black and white whilst the blackupper parts of the body are conspicuously marked with a regular seriesof nearly square white spots becoming oval in shape on the wingcoverts the bill is black the irides crimson After the autumn moultall this finery is lost and the upper parts become a nearly uniformblackishbrown This Diver breeds sparingly in various parts of theHebrides and the Highlands from Argyll to Caithness elsewhere it isonly known as a winter visitor In many of its habits it closelyresembles the preceding species It is exclusively aquatic only seekingthe land during the breeding season but is perhaps not quite sooceanic as that bird in the winter when it not unfrequently hauntsinland waters It dives with equal skill flies with the same powerfulrapidity and utters during the nesting season very similar unearthlycries Fish form the chief food of this Diver but it is said also tocapture frogs Most of the examples of this Diver that are seen closeinshore on our eastern and southern coasts principally during winterare immature the older birds as a rule keeping further out to sea TheBlackthroated Diver indulges in the same peculiar habit of graduallysinking its body in the sea when alarmed and will frequently seek toescape pursuit by diving outright and swimming under water for aconsiderable distanceThe Blackthroated Divers that breed with us retire to their inlandhaunts in May Its favourite nesting places are on islands in moorlandlochs pools and tarns It displays few social tendencies at thisseason although several pairs not unfrequently nest within acomparatively small area of exceptionally suitable country eachnevertheless keeping to its own particular haunt This Diver may alsopair for life seeing that it evinces considerable attachment to certainfavourite nesting places The nest is always made upon the ground andseldom very far from the water to which the frightened bird can retirereadily An island covered with short herbage is always preferred inScotland but in some places the bare shingly beach is selected Thisnest often of the slightest construction is made of stalks of plantsroots and all kinds of drifted vegetable fragments lined with grassSometimes no nest whatever is made The two eggs are narrow andelongated olive or rufousbrown sparingly spotted and speckled withblackishbrown and paler brown The sitting bird is ever on the alert toslip off into the water at the first alarm and sometimes both birdswill fly round and round in anxiety for the fate of their treasuredeggs A movement seawards is soon taken when the young are sufficientlymatured This Diver has a wide geographical range outside our limitsextending across Europe and Asia to Japan and Northwest Americaperhaps as far as Hudson Bay American authorities however insist uponthe specific distinctness of most of the Blackthroated Divers found inAlaska and have named this form C pacificus                          REDTHROATED DIVERSmallest of the British Divers the present species the Colymbusseptentrionalis of Linnus and modern authorities is also the bestknown and the most widely distributed It is also the least showy innuptial dress In this plumage the throat is marked with an elongatedpatch of chestnut the head and sides of the neck are ashbrown thelatter striped with black and white the general colour of the upperplumage blackishbrown sparingly spotted with white and the underparts are white The plumage as in all the Divers is remarkably denseand compact adapted in every way to the aquatic habits of the bird TheRedthroated Diver is a fairly frequent visitor during autumn andwinter off the English coasts often entering bays and the mouths ofwide rivers In summer however it becomes much more local retiringthen to haunts in Scotland especially in the Hebrides and along thewild and little populated western districts from the Clyde northwardsto the Shetlands Outside our limits this Diver has a very widedistribution occupying in summer the Arctic and north temperate regionsof Europe Asia and America in winter migrating southwards for athousand miles or more The Redthroated Diver is certainly the mostgregarious species and in winter may not unfrequently be seen ingatherings of varying size In connection with this trait mention maybe made of the extraordinary numbers of this bird that on the 2nd and3rd of December 1879 passed Heligoland The movement was not strictly amigratory one but a grand flight of stormdriven frozenout birdsseeking more congenial haunts Gtke tells us that during thisvisitation there was about thirteen degrees of frost an easterly windand a snowstorm in the evening The Divers were by no means alone intheir distress for hundreds of thousands of Ducks Geese and SwansCurlews Dunlins and Oystercatchers passed from east to west Fromearly morning until noon on both days in succession the Divers wereseen in one incessant stream travelling northeast in numbersestimated almost by the million Well may Gtke have wondered whencesuch vast multitudes came and whither they were going and what was theinitial cause of such gregarious instincts never manifested in thisDiver under any ordinary circumstancesThe Redthroated Diver is a master at the art of diving and is oftenseen slowly to sink its body under water when alarmed It also flieswith great strength and speed and is said to show more preference forflying than either of its congeners The food of this Diver is chieflycomposed of fish Its ordinary note is a harsh ak or hark but atthe nesting places the same wild unearthly cries are uttered that areequally characteristic of the other species These cries are said toforetell rain or rough weather and have caused the bird to be calledRain Goose in many Highland districts The Redthroated Diver howeveragile and graceful it may be in the water or even in the air is aclumsy object on the land incapable of walking upright owing to thebackward position of its legs and compelled to shuffle along with itsbreast touching the surface In winter these Divers are by no means shyand I have many times watched them pursuing their fishing operationsfrom my station on the cliffsIn May the Redthroated Diver retires to its breeding stationsthe wildromantic lochs and pools so characteristic a feature of the Highlandsand the Hebrides Solitary pairs generally scatter themselves over adistrict resenting intrusion and keeping to their own particularhaunt This Diver probably pairs for life returning each successiveseason to a certain spot to nest An island is usually selected for thenest which is invariably made upon the ground and consists generallyof little more than a hollow into which is collected a few bits ofwithered vegetation As may be expected this nest is seldom made farfrom the water so that at the least alarm the sitting bird can slip offand shuffle into the water at once The two narrow elongated eggs areolive or buffishbrown spotted and speckled with blackishbrown andpaler brown                                GREBESIn many respects Grebes are remarkable birds They form so well defineda group that no other known bird can possibly be confused with themtheir characteristics being absolutely unique among the class Aves Themost noticeable external features of a Grebe are its relatively shortbody laterally compressed tarsi lobed feet rudimentary andfunctionless tail and dense compact plumage of a peculiar silkytexture The twenty or so species of Grebes are grouped into a singlefamily called Podicipedid of which the genus Podiceps or morecorrectly Podicipes contains the greater number The Grebes arealmost cosmopolitan Five wellmarked species are found in Europe allof which being visitants or regular residents are included in theBritish avifauna In the colours of their plumage the Grebes are notvery remarkable with the exception of the crests or tippets assumed bysome species during the nuptial period plain browns predominate on theupper surface the underparts are almost always glossy white The Grebesfly well dive with great dexterity but their movements on the groundare not graceful The young are hatched covered with close down andable to swim at once The Grebes have a complete moult in autumn andassume their nuptial ornaments in spring The quill feathers are moultedso rapidly that for some little time the birds are unable to fly as isthe case with the Geese and some othersIt is only during the winter months that the Grebes become pelagic ormarine in their habits and even some species are much less addicted toa sea life than others We will now proceed briefly to glance at theBritish species                          GREAT CRESTED GREBEThis the largest species the Podicipes cristatus of naturalists ischiefly an inland bird but resorts to the sea when fresh waters arefrozen I have sometimes met with half a dozen together in a quiet bayunder these circumstances and very graceful interesting birds they areThey rarely come upon the land at these times swimming about and divingfrom time to time in quest of food Like the Divers they sometimes sinkthe body very low in the water but under ordinary conditions sit ratherhigh with the long neck held well up the head turned at intervals inall directions as if on the look out for enemies They always prefer todive when pursued and as this species more especially is in greatdemand by plumasiers and subject to much persecution it is wary andshy in extreme The food of this Grebe whilst on the sea is composedlargely of fish but inland the birds tastes are more omnivorousSometimes many of its own feathers are found in its stomach mixed withthe food but as yet ornithologists have been unable to assign anyplausible explanation of the fact In Spring the adults assume two veryconspicuous crests or horns of a dark brown colour and a tippet or ruffof bright bay shading into nearly black on the margin The birds nowretire inland to meres and lakes where the shallows are full of reedssedges rushes and other aquatic vegetation and here at some distancefrom the shore a large floating nest is made composed of dead anddecaying vegetation As the bird is sometimes gregarious several nestsmay often be found within a small areahuge floating rafts moored to thereeds or built up from the bottom of the shallow water In a shallowdepression at the top four or five eggs are laid elliptical in shapechalky in texture and white until contact with the birds wet feet andthe wet nest covers them with stains Several mock nests are often madein the vicinity of the one containing the eggs probably destined asresting places for the future young The sitting bird very dexterouslycovers its eggs with weed when alarmed previous to slipping off thenest into the water The note of this Grebe is a loud kak                           REDNECKED GREBEThis Grebe the Podicipes griseigena of Boddaert and the Prubricollis of most modern naturalists is a fairly common wintervisitor to the seas off our eastern and southern coasts from theOrkneys to Cornwall The range of the Rednecked Grebe outside ourlimits is a wide one and embraces during summer the subArctic portionsof Europe Asia and America becoming much more southerly in winterDuring winter this Grebe may be met with close inshore yet it seldom ornever visits the land living exclusively on the sea Its habits at thisseason do not differ in any marked degree from those of its congenersIt may be seen swimming to and fro sometimes just outside the fringe ofrough surf diving from time to time in quest of its food which at thisseason is composed of fish principally The nuptial ornaments of thisGrebe are not so conspicuous as those of the preceding species the darkcrests are shorter the tippet is scarcely perceptible and the lowerneck and upper breast are rich chestnut In winter plumage this Grebe isbest distinguished by its large sizenext in this respect to the GreatCrested Grebeand by the absence of the white streak over the eye whichcharacterises that bird then In April the Rednecked Grebe returns toits accustomed inland summer haunts to breed These are reed andrushfringed lakes and ponds Here in the shallows a floating nest ofrotten vegetation is formed smaller than that of the preceding speciesbut otherwise closely resembling it Many pairs may be found breedingclose togetherin colonies so to speak The four or five ellipticalshaped eggs are laid in May or June dirty white in colour chalky intexture The same habit of covering the eggs with weeds previous toleaving them may also be noted                          BLACKNECKED GREBEThis bird the Podicipes nigricollis of systematists is so rarely metwith in the British area that it scarcely requires more than a passingallusion Examples occasionally occur on our eastern and southern coastsespecially but the bird is too rare to form any feature in theornithology of the British seaboard It may be readily distinguishedfrom the other European Grebes by its decidedly upcurved bill and bythe large amount of white on the primaries and secondaries In thenuptial plumage the head and neck are black In its habits generally itdiffers little from the other species                           SCLAVONIAN GREBEAlong the eastern coasts of England and round most of the Scottishlittoral as well as off Ireland this species the Podicipes cornutusof most naturalists is of tolerably frequent occurrence during winterIt requires all the skill of an expert ornithologist to distinguish thisGrebe in winter plumage so closely does it resemble the Redneckedspecies It is a shorter winged bird and has the three outermostsecondaries dusky brown instead of white as in that bird whilst theprevious species is always distinguishable by its upcurved bill Thereis nothing in the habits of this Grebe to call for special remark itkeeps exclusively to the water dives to escape danger and to captureprey and swims beneath the surface as adroitly as a frog TheSclavonian Grebe is a wide ranging species inhabiting during summer theArctic and subArctic regions of Europe Asia and America retiringsouthwards in winter This Grebe is exceptionally remarkable for itsnuptial ornaments but which as usual are confined to the head andupper neck Two chestnut or baycoloured crests start backwards over theeyes whilst the tippet is black This ornament when extended to itsutmost looks very beautiful and gives the head an appearance of beingsurrounded by a glittering aureole This Grebe is a late breeder theeggs not being laid before June It retires to freshwater pools for thepurpose of nesting and resembles the other species closely in itshabits at this season making a slovenly floating nest and laying fouror five dull white eggs                             LITTLE GREBEThis species is the smallest of the European Grebes and certainly byfar the best known member of the family found in the British Islands Itis rather remarkable that the Little Grebe was unknown as a distinctspecies to Linnus It was known to Brisson as Colymbus minor and tomost modern ornithologists as Podicipes minor although some fewwriters speak of this bird as P fluviatilis Outside the BritishIslands it has a very wide distribution in Europe Asia and Africa butthe Little Grebe of America is a distinct species The Little Grebe isfound more or less frequently on the coast during winter driven theretowhen frosts seal up its inland haunts On the coast this bird is morepartial to the brackish backwaters dykes and estuaries than to theopen sea The food of this bird consists not only of fish but smallcrustaceans and molluscs aquatic insects young frogs and variousvegetable fragments Its habits are very similar to those of the otherGrebes its swimming and diving powers are wonderful its flight onoccasion is rapid and strong whilst its note is a shrill but not veryloud weet In its nesting economy the Little Grebe closely resemblesits congeners It quits the coast in spring resorting to inland poolsoften of very small size making its usually floating orwatersurrounded nest amongst the vegetation fringing the shallows onwhich it deposits five or six eggs dull white in colour The parentsoften dive with their young from the nest to carry them out of impendingdangera habit common to all species in this genus                              CORMORANTSThe Grebes are so little in evidence to the seaside naturalist that anaccount of them seems more like a digression in our narrative than acontinuation of our observations concerning the bird life of the sea Wenow however reach another pelagic group consisting of birds that forman important and seldom absent feature in marine ornithology And yetso great is the adaptability of some species the Cormorant is by nomeans exclusively confined to the sea has many inland breedingstations and repeatedly wanders from the coast to fresh waters wherean abundant supply of fish offers a solace to its great voracity TheCormorants and the Gannet are members of the family Phalacrocoracidalthough generically distinct from each other Their principal externalcharacteristics are the webbed feet each toe including the hind onebeing connected by a membrane the long and powerful wings and thestrong beak The young birds in this family are hatched naked and blindbut soon become clothed with down The first plumage differsconsiderably from that of maturity and the latter is not rarelyattained for several years These birds have but one actual moult in theyear in autumn but just previous to the pairing season in wintercrests in some species and ornamental filaments and tufts in othersare assumed but are lost by abrasion during the ensuing breedingperiod Three members of this family are British and breed abundantlywithin our limits Cormorants and Gannets are widely dispersed speciesthe former are almost cosmopolitan only being absent from the polarregions and Polynesia the latter are most abundant in the tropics andthe southern seas A detailed account of the three British species willnow be given                               CORMORANTFrom the autumn onwards to the following spring there are few parts ofthe coast indeed where this bird the Phalacrocorax carbo ofornithologists may not be seen whilst even in summer it issufficiently widely dispersed to merit us classing it as common It ishowever seldom seen off lowlying coasts save after the breedingseason or except such individuals as have not yet reached maturityThere is but one other British species with which the Cormorant may beconfused and that is the Shag but even then the difference in size issufficiently great for the much larger Cormorant to be readilyidentified Very black very heavy and very clumsy the Cormorant looksas he rises in slow cumbersome flight from the sea or unfolds his bigbronzedgreen wings and flutters into the air from a rock shelf orseagirdled pinnacle but very soon ones opinion of him undergoes achange as when once fairly on his way he passes swiftly enough overthe sea to a distant resting place or after flying some distancepitches down into the water The colours of the Cormorant are not seento best advantage at a distance Certainly the prevailing colour isblack but this is richly loricated with green and purple tints whilstmost of the upper plumage of the body is a beautiful bronzybrown thefeathers being margined with soft velvetyblack shot with green thethroat is white as are also the sides of the head whilst the brightyellow gape and bare portions of the throat form a pleasing contrast tothe more sombre hues As the breeding season approaches the Cormorantincreases in beauty large white patches of silky feathers spring outfrom the thighs and the dark head and neck become covered by featheryfilaments of white Perhaps the Cormorant is most interesting whenengaged searching for food This bird obtains its food in various waysMost frequently of all it swims to and fro diving with a headlongplunge at intervals sometimes it swims with its body low in the waterand the head and neck below the surface peering about in quest of fishLess frequently it takes up its station on a rock or even on a treefrom which it flies from time to time Kingfisherlike to capture afish near the surface or occasionally it dives from such a situationand pursues its finny food far down into the crystal depths TheCormorant however never fishes like the Gannets and the Terns by aheadlong plunge from the sky This bird may often be met with fishing infreshwater some distance inland Waterton records how it used to visithis lake at Walton Hall but the habits of the bird on sea and shoreshall exclusively claim our attention here After a meal the Cormorantis very fond of resorting to a rock to rest and to dry its plumagestanding perfectly motionless with its wings uplifted and outspreadFew if any birds can excel the Cormorant in diving it vies with thevery fish themselves and seems as much at home beneath the surface ofthe water as in the air The Cormorant when taken young is easily tamedand from the earliest recorded times it has been trained to capture fishfor its owner To this day the Chinese and Japanese train Cormorants forthis purpose In England this sport was once a regal pleasure theMaster of the Cormorants finding a place in the Royal householdAccording to Professor Newton the sport still lingers amongst a fewWillughby asserts that the trained Cormorant was carried hooded untilcast off but nowadays its bearer protects his eyes from a stroke fromthe birds beak with a wire mask A strap or a ring is fastened roundthe Cormorants neck to prevent it swallowing its captures just as wemuzzle a ferret to prevent it lying up All who have witnessed thisnovel way of fishing testify to the birds marvellous skill in catchingfish after fish until the gular pouch will hold no more when theCormorant is taken and the fish removed The food of this bird iscomposed almost entirely of fish In winter Cormorants become even moregregarious often associating in large flocks which wander far in questof food This bird is not so completely pelagic in its habits as theAuks the Divers and the Grebes It generally retires to the caves andshelves of the cliffs to sleep whilst stormy weather will drive itshorewards soon where it will sit and mope on the rocks or shelter inthe quiet creeks or under the lee of cliffs as if waiting for the seato subside and allow of its labours being renewedAs the Cormorant returns for years in succession to one particular spotto breed there can be little doubt that it pairs for life The birdsbegin to associate closely in pairs somewhat early in spring but actualnesting duties do not commence for a little time after that event Inmost places the Cormorant breeds in colonies the size apparentlyvarying according to the amount of accommodation For the presentpurpose we need not describe in detail any of the inland nesting placesof this species beyond remarking that the bird often breeds in treeslike Rooks making a huge nest of sticks and twigs lined with grassUpon the coast the favourite breeding resorts of the Cormorant areranges of lofty cliffs and small low islands and reefs The nest maythus either be on the groundas at the Farne Islands for instanceor ona ledge of the cliffs When in the former situation it is generallycomposed of masses of seaweed stalks of marine plants and lined withgreen grass or other herbage A Cormorants nesting place is by no meansa pleasant one for persons whose olfactory nerves are sensitive thesmell from the decaying fish and from the droppings of the birds thatliterally whitewash the whole vicinity being sickening in the extremeOther sea fowl usually give these colonies a wide birth The eggs arefrom three to six in number of a delicate bluishgreenwhere the colourcan be detected through the abundant coating of limesmall for the sizeof the bird and long and oval in shape When disturbed the sittingCormorants make little demonstration but fly out to sea at once Butone brood is reared in the season and the eggs are deposited duringApril or May in the British Islands The Cormorant is a silent birdthe only note I have ever heard it utter has been a croaking one at thenest                                 SHAGThis species the Pelecanus graculus of Linnus and Latham and thePhalacrocorax graculus of most modern writers is readilydistinguished from the Cormorant by its smaller size more glossyappearance and much greener general colouration The Shag differsstructurally from the Cormorant in possessing only twelve tail feathersthe latter bird having fourteen The nuptial ornaments are also verydifferent for just previous to the pairing season in early spring anodding plume or frontal crest of recurved feathers is assumed The Shagis a much more marine bird than the Cormorant and its appearance inlandis exceptional Of the two species the Shag is certainly the commonestand most widely dispersed being met with off almost all parts of theBritish coasts but preference is shown for such as are rocky and wherethe ranges of cliffs are full of hollows and caves Outside our islandsthe range of the Shag is restricted to the coasts of western Europe andthe Mediterranean basin As a rule the Shag keeps well into the coastseeking for its food in the somewhat deep water below the rocks andretiring to some fissure or cave to sleep Its habits in most respectsare very similar to the larger species It flies well and rapidly if ina somewhat laboured manner dives as skilfully as its ally and oftenindulges in the habit of sitting on the rocks with wings extendedbasking in the sun It is equally gregarious during the nonbreedingseason and it is no uncommon thing to see a hundred or more birds ofthis species sitting in solemn statuesque rows on some seaencircledrock gorged with fish and digesting their food At these gatheringsmany birds may be noticed still fishing in the sea around or flying upto or leaving the rocky resting place The young birds congregateindiscriminately with the adults A fishing Shag is a very interestingobject He may be watched quietly swimming along and every now and thenspringing half out of the water arching his long neck and then divinghead first into the sea Soon he reappears again the body coming intoview all at once it may be close to where he dived or it may be fiftyor a hundred yards away from the spot where he descended The Shag feedsalmost exclusively on fishes and these are chased through the waterwith incredible skill The bird may thus be watched by the hour togetherswimming and diving propelling itself by its feet and bringing thecaptured fish to the surface to swallow them At the approach of nightthe Shag almost invariably betakes itself to the shelter of some cave orfissure and it is no uncommon sight along the rockbound shore to see adozen of these birds hurrying along close to the sea in silence towardsthe rocks where they sleepThe Shag breeds in May Its favourite nesting haunts are the caves andfissures in the cliffs but where such are wanting or not availablethe bird will content itself with a cranny amongst the rocks of a lowisland If plenty of accommodation exists many pairs of Shags will nestin company where suitable sites are scarce the birds breed in scatteredpairs along the coast It is more than probable that the Shag pairs forlife it returns season by season to its old nestingplace The nest ofthis species is either wedged into some crevice of the sides or roof ormade upon a ledge in a cave sometimes a hole in the face of a walllikecliff is chosen less frequently a site is selected amongst the roughboulders on a reef or even on a ledge of the cliffs where they overhangconsiderably In most cases the nest is bulky and made of sticks stalksof plants and seaweed lined with straws coarse grass and turf allmore or less matted together with droppings decaying fish and slimeand smelling most unpleasantly Many nests are enlarged and patched upyear by year The two three or four eggs are a little smaller thanthose of the Cormorant of a delicate bluishgreen where the thickcoating of lime does not conceal it The Shag shows more reluctance toleave its nest than the Cormorant does The effect is most startling asthe big birds dash out of the gloomy sea caves one after the other Theonly note I have heard this species utter has been a low croak                                GANNETThis remarkable bird differs in many important respects from all otherpelagic species inhabiting the temperate portions of the northernhemisphere Outside the limits of the British Islands its only otherbreeding places in Europe are on Iceland and the Fares The Gannet orSolan Goose the Sula bassana of Brisson and modern naturalists isone of the most pelagic of birds Except during the breeding season itis rarely seen near land the thousands of birds that congregate in afew chosen spots round the British coasts dispersing themselves far outto sea as soon as the duties of the year are over Like the Albatrossthe Gannet may almost be said to live in the air Its powers of flightare simply magnificent Occasionally a few odd birds may be observedhere and there fishing in the bays during autumn and winter but theperson who would study its habits and movements thoroughly must visitone of its breeding places There are many colonies of Gannets round theBritish coasts one of the most accessible and perhaps the most famousbeing on the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth There are small ones onLundy Island and Grassholm large ones on Suleskerry Sulisker StKilda Ailsa Craig and Little Skellig The adult plumage of the Gannetis white tinged with buff on the head and neck except the primarieswhich are black The bare skin round the base of the bill is blue Thebird probably does not attain its white plumage until nearly four yearsold passing through a series of mottled stages of black brown andwhite The young are hatched blind and naked but eventually becomeclothed in dense white down Other structural peculiarities are theclosed nostrils and the subcutaneous air cells almost covering thebody which the bird can fill with air at will as they communicate withthe lungs Whether seen at its nest or when fishing at sea the Gannetis a remarkably interesting bird As may naturally be inferred a birdso light and buoyant as the Gannet does not obtain its food by divingIt is incapable of submerging itself even for a little distance exceptby gaining sufficient momentum from a plunge headlong from some distancein the air Nevertheless the Gannet feeds exclusively on fishes whichit catches almost like a Tern by dropping from a great height andseizing or impaling them with its strong bill The Gannets follow theshoals of fish as they swim near the surface First one bird and thenanother will be seen to poise itself and then with closed wings todash downwards glinting like a piece of white marble in the sun intothe sea disappearing for a moment then rising again into the air toprepare for another descent Many Gannets at these times may perhapsbe seen swimming but they are merely resting not fishing The capturedfish is invariably swallowed at once The sitting birds are kept wellsupplied with fish by their mates These fish however are not conveyedto them in the beak but in the gullet from which they are disgorgedand left by the nest side to be eaten as required Very often a Gannetwill disgorge several large fish before leaving its nest whilst manymore fish are brought to the rocks than are actually eaten The Gannetis a voracious eater and often so gorges itself with food as to beincapable of flight The power of wing of this beautiful bird iswonderful in the extreme I have seen the Gannet repeatedly keep the airfor hours together apparently without effort wheeling in gracefulcurves and ascending to vast heights just as Vultures are wont to doAlthough the Gannet is a resident in British waters it seldom comesnear land except to breed During the nesting season it is verygregarious and some of its stations contain many thousands of pairsEarly in the spring Gannets begin to assemble at the breeding placesand towards the end of April nest building commences The nests are madeeither on the ledges of the cliffs amongst the broken rock fragments atthe summit or on the flat tablelike tops of pinnacles and stacksWhere the birds are numerous and the accommodation limited greatnumbers of nests are crowded together and as may readily be inferredsuch close companionship leads to not a few battles between the birdsthemselves Indeed a sort of guerrilla warfare is being wagedconstantly and is by no means one of the least interesting features ofthe nevertobeforgotten scene The nest of the Gannet possesses littlearchitectural beauty and is generally so trodden out of shape as toresemble a mere heaped mass of rubbish caked together with droppingsand slime and filth giving off an almost unbearable stench especiallyon a calm hot day in May or June Seaweed masses of turf straws mossand stalks of marine plants are the principal materials The nest isshaped like a flattened cone the cavity at the top being shallow It isno unusual thing to see the birds adding to their nests even whenincubation is in progress The Gannet lays but a single egg but if thisbe takenas it often is especially in colonies easily accessible tomanthe bird will replace it several times in succession It is palebluishgreen but generally so thickly coated with chalky matterandlater with stainsas to hide all trace of this colour There are fewmore noisy animated scenes in bird life than a Gannet colony during theheight of the breeding season The stirring sight once witnessed cannever be forgotten The air for many yards from the face of the cliffsand high above it is filled with thousands of flying Gannets everyavailable spot on the edges and face of the rock itself is occupied bya Gannet the standing birds vieing with each other in uttering harshcries the flying birds silently drifting to and fro in a mazybewildering throng Many of the flying birds are carrying nestmaterials many of the birds standing on the rocks are fast asleep Onevery side the Gannets are eyeing you suspiciously some disgorging fishprevious to taking wing others barking defiance as you approach themand stubbornly remaining upon their egg until absolutely pushed from itRock sea and air teem with birds It will however be remarked thatnone of the birds fly over the land all keep to the face of the cliffsAt the Bass Rock numbers of young Gannets used to be taken for foodthe proprietor baking quantities and selling them to the country peopleround about The taste for baked Solan Geese however is not soprevalent as formerly and the custom seems likely to die out At StKilda however the Gannet harvest still continues to be gathered andthe young birds form a welcome article of food                       Ducks Geese and

inlandspecies and resort to fresh waters Again the majority of these birdsdo not breed within the limits of the British Islands they are wintervisitors from more northern lands and return to those lands in springStill there are a few species resident in our area eminently marine intheir habits and forming constant and pleasing features in thebirdlife of the coast United the Ducks Geese and Swans form thewelldefined family Anatid which may be readily divided intohalfadozen subfamilies all but one of which are represented at sometime of the year on our seaboard The most important externalcharacteristics of the birds in this family are the peculiar laminatedbill the short legs the webbed feet and the dense compact plumageThe family is almost cosmopolitan in its distribution                           NONDIVING DUCKSRepresentatives of no less than three of the four subfamilies intowhich the Ducks have been divided by systematists are found on theBritish coastline Each subfamily contains some thoroughly marinespecies We will deal first with the Anatin containing the Sheldrakesand nondiving Ducks The birds in this subfamily are distinguishedfrom all others by having the tarsus scutellated or plated in front andby having only a narrow membrane attached to the hind toe A peculiarityabout these Ducks is that they never dive for their food This isobtained only in shallow water by submerging the fore half of the bodyand dabbling and probing amongst the mud and weeds In the Sheldrakesthe sexes are nearly alike in colour but in the remaining species thereis usually considerable difference in this respect the males or drakesbeing handsome showy birds the females or ducks brown andcomparatively sombrelooking The Sheldrakes moult once in autumn theremaining species the same but the drakes of these latter change theirsmall feathers twice once in early summer and once in autumn The youngare hatched covered with down and able to a great extent to shift forthemselves                               SHELDRAKEThis remarkably handsome species the Anas cornuta of S G Gmelinand the Tadorna cornuta of most modern naturalists is a resident onsuch parts of the British coasts as are suited to its needsUnfortunately continued persecution has driven this beautiful Duck frommany a haunt along the coast and it is now almost entirely confinedduring the breeding season to the more secluded districts or to suchplaces where man may accord it some measure of protection Low sandycoasts and extensive dunes by the sea are the favourite resort of theSheldrake and owing to its secretive habits and exceptional warinessit is a species that may be very easily overlooked During the breedingseason an observer may wander for hours up and down the haunts of thisDuck without seeing a single bird Once seen however it is easilyidentifiedno other bird along the coast more readily The harlequinarrangement of the colours is more eccentric perhaps than beautifulThe bill to begin with is crimson the head and upper neck are darkmetallicgreen the lower neck is white and below this is a broad bandof bay or chestnut the rump upper tail coverts and tail except thetip which is black part of the secondaries and innermost scapularsthe wing coverts the sides of the belly and the flanks are white theremainder of the wings and outermost scapulars and a broad line fromthe breast to the vent are black the alar speculum is green the tarsusand feet are pink At a distance the bird looks like a patchworkarrangement of black white and red which becomes even more pronouncedwhen it takes flight and in a slow Heronlike way with measured beatsof the wings passes out to sea or down the coast to more secludedhaunts During the breeding season this Duck frequents the sand duneson the English coast but is rare and local in the south in Scotland itis commoner and may be met with in almost all places suited to itsrequirements including the Hebrides In Ireland however it becomeslocal and uncommon although widely dispersed When the young are rearedthe bird becomes more widely distributed but even then its preferencefor the sand makes it still local The Sheldrake is known by manyprovincial names among which may be mentioned Burrow DuckBergander and Shellduck The origin of this Ducks colloquial nameis somewhat obscure although Willughby and Ray attribute it to thebirds stronglycontrasted plumagesheld being the East Anglianequivalent for particoloured[5] The Old Norse name for this Duck wasskjldungr from skjldr a piebald horse The Sheldrake is certainlya social bird but can scarcely be termed a gregarious one Smallparties may be seen feeding in the shallows or swimming in the sea Thebird obtains its food either whilst wandering along the shoreits gaitis more elegant than that of most Ducks owing to the comparativelylonger legsor when swimming in water just deep enough for it to reachthe sandy bottom when the fore part of the body is submerged and thehind quarters held almost perpendicular This food consists chiefly ofsandhoppers crustaceans molluscs and small fish but on shore thebird also eats grass stems and leaves of aquatic plants and worms TheSheldrake rarely wanders far from the sea its visits to the land seldomextending beyond the dunes or the rough saltings The note of this Duckis a harsh quack but in the pairing season an oftrepeated tremulouscry is uttered and when the young are abroad a guttural kurr isheardThe breeding season of the Sheldrake begins in April or May Althoughinstances of this bird breeding some distance from the coast are onrecord Stevensons Birds of Norfolk its ordinary nestingplaces arenever far from the sea Its favourite breedinggrounds are sand duneslinks flat sandbanks and small islands in sea lochs firths orestuaries The bird is not very social at this period and although manypairs may occupy a comparatively small area of coast each seems to keepclosely to its own particular domain The nest is made at the end of aburrow a rabbit hole being frequently selected but sometimes the birdis said to excavate one for itself in which case it follows a nearlycircular direction Sometimes the nest is ten or fifteen feet from theentrance and in places where rabbits are numerous it is often analmost hopeless task to discover it one burrow running into another inbewildering perplexity At the end of the burrow a rude nest of drygrass is formeda rabbits nest is not unfrequently utilisedwhich asincubation advances is thickly lined with down from the parents bodyFew nests are more difficult to find sometimes the parents will betrayits whereabouts when one bird relieves the other but as a rule themale is seldom seen near it and both sexes are remarkably cautious inleaving or visiting it The eggs are usually from six to twelve but asmany as sixteen have been known They are creamywhite in colour smoothand polished in texture The down in the nest of the Sheldrake is abeautiful lavendergray The young are soon taken to the beach afterthey are hatched where the little creatures are remarkably active incatching sandhoppers                                WIGEONOf all the more typical birds in this subfamily the present speciesthe Anas penelope of naturalists is by far the best known along thecoast The male bird is a very pretty and conspicuous one in hisbeautifully pencilled back and flanks and distinguished from afar byhis bright buff forehead and crown and white wing coverts The femaleis much less showily coloured The Wigeon arrives upon our seaboardfrom the Arctic regions in vast numbers every autumn and from thattime forward to the following spring resides with us This autumnmigration of the Wigeon begins late in September and lasts well on intoNovember The birds begin to leave us again in March and most havedeparted by the end of the following month The Wigeon whilst with usis one of the most gregarious of the Ducks and flocks of vast size maysometimes be observed in our shallower seas close inshore in estuariesand bays but perhaps more frequently further out at sea These birdsobtain most of their food at night in such localities where they aresubjected to much persecution as often happens for their flesh isvalued as an article for the table coming landwards at dusk andretiring to the open sea at dawn The flight of this species is rapidyet almost noiseless and the bird may sometimes be seen gliding downfrom the air to the water on stiff and motionless wings but flappingthem rapidly just as it drops tail first into the sea Its note ishighly characteristic a shrill far sounding meeow or weeow Thefood consists of grass buds and leaves of aquatic plants grass wrackcrustaceans and molluscs Many Wigeons are caught in the flightnets onthe Wash a locality which is or used to be twenty years ago afavourite resort of this DuckA few Wigeons remain in our Islands to breed frequenting the northerncounties of Scotland including the Orkneys and the Shetlands but thevast majority return to the Arctic regions to do so Its favouritenestingplaces are scrubby woodlands swamps and heaths clothed withcoarse herbage studded with lakes and tarns and intersected bystreams Although not gregarious at this period the numbers of nestsfound scattered over a small area suggests at least a social tendencyThe nest is usually made close to the waterside amongst heath orgrass or sheltered by a little bush and is made of dry herbage andleaves warmly lined with down plucked from the body of the female Thesix to ten eggs are cream or buffishwhite smooth in texture but withlittle gloss These are laid in May                             PINTAIL DUCKThis elegant species the Anas acuta of Linnus by some modernwriters generically distinguished as Dafila acuta is next to theWigeon perhaps the most abundant of the nondiving Ducks upon thecoast Like that bird it visits the British seas in some numbers inautumn returning north in spring From the extreme length of the twocentral upper tail coverts which project two inches or more beyond thetail this Duck has been termed the Sea Pheasant in some districtsalthough in others the name is applied to the Longtailed Ducka memberof the next subfamily The male is distinguished by his brown headshot with bronze tints black nape and white stripe on either side ofthe neck which runs into the white underparts by the green speculumemphasised above with pale chestnut and below with white and finelypencilled black and gray upper plumage the long pointed blackscapulars broadly edged with dull white are also a noteworthy featureThe female is much less showily coloured mottledbrown above andgrayishwhite below but the brown tail feathers obliquely barred withwhite readily distinguish her from allied species The favourite hauntsof the Pintail during its sojourn with us are the shallow estuariesespecially on our eastern and southern coasts It arrives on our coastschiefly in October and November and leaves them in April The Pintailis a remarkably gregarious species congregating in large flocks duringwinter and it has been observed that many of these gatherings arecomposed exclusively of male birds It is a shy and wary bird feedingprincipally at night visiting the land or the shallows at dusk andwhen so engaged sentinels are generally on the lookout ready to givethe alarm It obtains its food by dipping the fore half of the bodyunder water and exploring the mud with its bill but sometimes stubblesand meadows near the sea are visited for the purpose This food consistschiefly of aquatic plants grass insects worms molluscs andcrustaceans This Duck swims well and buoyantly looking very gracefulon the water it rarely dives even when wounded whilst on the groundit walks with long neck extended and tail raised The Pintail flies welland rapidly the wings making a peculiar and easily recognised swishingsoundThe Pintail migrates northwards in flocks and reaches its Arcticbreeding grounds as soon as the ice begins to break up crowding on thelittle pools and narrow belt of open water on the sides of the riversand filling the air like swarms of bees A few pairs remain in theBritish Islands for the summer Swampy moors and the banks of lakes andponds are the favourite nestingplaces of this Duck The nest madeupon the ground amongst herbage or under the shelter of a rock or bushis composed of dry grass withered leaves sedges and rushes and linedcopiously with down The eggs are from six to ten in number and arepale buffishgreen smooth but lustreless These are laid in May ThePintail is by no means a noisy bird a low chattering may be heard froma flock whilst feeding a soft quack when the bird is alarmed whilstthe drake during the season of courtship utters a deep clkpreceded by a hiss and followed by a low grating note Outside ourislands the Pintail has a very wide distribution breeding in thePalarctic and Nearctic regions and wintering almost to the EquatorOf the remaining five species of Ducks belonging to the presentsubfamily which are either regular visitors to our islands orresidents in them none can fairly be classed as being typically marinein their haunts The wellknown Mallard Anas boschas the Teal Anascrecca and the Shoveller Anas clypeata visit the lowlying coastsespecially during severe weather but they are all eminently freshwaterspecies and form no dominant feature in the birdlife of the coastStill less familiar to the seaside naturalist are the Gadwall Anasstrepera and the Garganey Anas circia The former species is rare inour islands even during winter whilst the latter is a summer visitoronly excessively local but breeding sparingly in the Broads Districtwhere from the peculiar note of the male it is known as the CricketTeal We will therefore pass on to a study of the next subfamilywhich contains birds eminently marine in their habits and economy                             DIVING DUCKSThese birds described somewhat ambiguously by certain authorities asSea Ducks for all the species are by no means exclusively marine yetall are expert divers form a fairly welldefined and homogenous groupor subfamily termed by systematists Fuligulin They arecharacterised by having a pendant lobe or membrane attached to thehind toe and by their anteriorly scutellated tarsi All the Ducks inthis subfamily habitually dive for their food and their movements inthe water are remarkably agile The sexes generally present considerabledifference in colour the males as usual being the most handsome andconspicuous The young are always hatched covered with down and soonable to accompany their parents on the water The females have a singlemoult in autumn but the males a partially double one Diving Ducks infact all species in the family in first plumage closely resemble theold female and acquire the adult plumage after the first autumn moultWe will deal first with the resident species as being constant featuresin the bird life of the coast and sea                              EIDER DUCKNo Duck is more thoroughly attached to the sea than this species theAnas mollissima of Linnus and Latham but the Somateria mollissimaof most modern ornithologists Unfortunately it is somewhat restrictedin its distribution only breeding in one locality on the English coastoccurring more or less accidentally elsewhere Ireland is not even sofortunate for no nesting station is known round the entire coastline ofthe island The Eider Duck is a decidedly northern bird and is foundif somewhat locally round the coasts of Scotland extending to theoutlying islands including St Kilda where I have taken its nest Tomost people perhaps the down of the Eider Duck in the form of acoverlet is more familiar than the bird itself Although somewhatclumsy in appearance the male Eider is a singularly handsome andconspicuous birdconspicuous one might say when standing on the rocksor paddling about the still water near the shore but even in a verymoderately rough sea the bird is detected with difficulty especially ata distance for the white crests and dark waves effectually harmonisewith and conceal its striking piebald plumage The two predominatingcolours of the male Eider are black and white the latter occupying mostof the upper surface the former most of the lower the head howeveris variously marked with black white and pale green The female isdark chestnutbrown variegated with brownishblack The Eider Duck isso thoroughly seagoing in its habits that it rarely even flies overthe land except to reach its nest and will rather follow the windingsof the coast than cross even a narrow headland In our islands it ispractically sedentary only wandering south a little way during winterIts favourite haunts are rocky islands and coasts where bays and quietfjords offer it a haven of safety The Eider is not so gregarious asmany other Ducks but it may be seen in parties all the year round thedrakes keeping company on the sea while their partners are on theirnests and when these latter come off them to feed all join into ascattered company The male bird is exceptionally wary at all times butthe female during the nesting period becomes absurdly tame in districtswhere not persecuted often allowing an observer to stroke her gentlywhilst she sits upon her eggs The food of the Eider Duck consists ofminute marine insects crustaceans and shellfish especially musselsand small crabs Most of this food is obtained by diving the Eiderbeing marvellously expert at this not only descending to a great depthbut remaining for a long time below A favourite method of feeding withthis species is to draw shorewards with the tide It may be watchedgradually swimming towards the land in some sheltered bay feeding as itcomes until the very edge of the breakers is reached Then comes by farthe prettiest sight of all as the bird swims through each mighty wavejust before it turns over and breaks upon the beach floating light as afoam fleck on the huge rollers now high up on the white crests thenmomentarily lost to view in the green glassy depths If alarmed on theseoccasions the Eider generally swims quickly out from shore but iffurther pursued or fired at it instantly takes wing rising from thewater with little splash and flying rapidly and steadily just above thesurface to a safer refuge The Eider is a day feeder abroad at dawnand continuing its labours well into the dusk As a rule the Eider is avery silent bird The usual note is a somewhat low kurr but in theseason of courtship the male utters a cooing sound when paying hisaddresses to his mate as he swims round and round her guarding herfrom the attentions of rivals This cooing noise may be heard for a longdistance across a quiet loch especially as often happens if severaldrakes are togetherThe favourite nesting places of the Eider Duck are low rocky islandswell covered with marine vegetation such as campion thrift and grassLate in spring the flocks begin to separate more into pairs althoughthe immature nonbreeding individuals may be observed to continuegregarious all the summer and not to visit the nesting stations Thelaying season is in May and June The female alone selects a site forand makes the nest the male rarely if ever visiting the spotalthough he keeps in attendance on the sea near the islands and joinsher when she comes to feed The nest is made upon the ground sometimesamongst the dense beds of campion sometimes in a crevice of theboulders or on a ledge of rock Occasionally as I remarked at StKilda it may be placed on the top of cliffs hundreds of feet above thesea It is large and well made consisting of coarse grass dry seaweedheather and bits of dead vegetation profusely lined with down and afew curly feathers from the body of the female alone This lininggradually accumulates as the eggs are laid Numbers of nests may befound close together especially where the birds are tolerably commonas for instance at the Farne Islands where by the way the Eider isknown as St Cuthberts Duck The eggs are from five to seven orrarely even eight pale olivegreen or greenishgray in colour andsmooth and waxlike in texture In many places the Eider is jealouslyprotected for the sake of its precious down especially in Iceland andNorway and the taking of the eggs or down by unauthorized persons is anoffence punishable by law Outside our limits the Eider inhabits mostof the coasts and islands of the North Atlantic The much rarer KingEider Somateria spectabilisan occasional visitor to the BritishSeasclaims a passing reference for it is by no means improbable thatthe species actually breeds within our limits                             COMMON SCOTEROf all the hordes of Ducks that pour southwards in autumn down thewestern coasts of Europe and find a winter resort in the British Seasthe present species the Anas nigra of Linnus the Fuligula nigraof many writers and demia nigra of others who regard the Scoters asgenerically distinct from the Pochard and allied forms is certainly byfar the commonest It is known on almost all parts of the coast as theBlack Duck Few other Ducks are so absolutely marine as the Scoter noweather is bad enough to drive it ashore and it seldom visits the landat all except for purposes of reproduction It is a gregarious birdand so large are some of its gatherings off the British coasts that itliterally blackens the sea with its numbers To see such a mighty hostof birds rise en masse from the water is a most imposing nay even athrilling sight The Common Scoter begins to arrive with us inSeptember and the migration continues right through the followingmonth The return passage begins in April and lasts into May All thebirds however do not pass northwards for flocks of immature Scotersfrequent British waters through the summer whilst a few pairs of adultsare even known to breed in the north of Scotland The Scoter is foundmost abundantly off our eastern coasts from the Orkneys to theGoodwins and thence but in smaller numbers along the English ChannelThe western districts are not visited so plentifully the flat coasts ofLancashire the north of Ireland and the Solway area being itsprincipal resorts This Scoter is an adept diver in fact almost allits food is obtained in that way Like the Eider the Scoter is fond ofworking shorewards with the tide feeding as it comes and retiring fromthe land again when its appetite is satisfied The food of this Duckconsists in winter chiefly of molluscs and crustaceans but in summerthe leaves roots and buds of aquatic plants are eaten as are alsoinsects The Scoter flies well and rapidly and is not unfrequently seenin the air especially when in flocks These sometimes circle and gyratefor some time after they are flushed before settling on the sea againThe usual note of the Scoter is a harsh kurr modulated into a moremusical sound by the drake during the pairing seasonEven during the breeding season the Common Scoter does not retire farfrom the sea Its favourite breeding grounds are by the lakes and riversamongst dwarfwillow and birchscrub and an island is always preferredThe nest is a mere hollow in the ground into which is collected alittle dry herbage This however is plentifully lined with down beforethe female begins to sit The bird is a late breeder the eggs not beinglaid much before the middle of June These are six to nine in numbergrayishbuff in colour smooth in texture and with little gloss Onlyone brood is reared and the female alone appears to take the entireduty of caring for the ducklings I should here remark that the adultmale Scoter is uniform bright black with the exception of anorangecoloured stripesaid to vary considerably in extentalong thecentral ridge of the upper mandible The female is nearly uniformdarkbrown The Scoter is an inhabitant of Arctic Europe and WestSiberia visiting more southern latitudes in winter                             VELVET SCOTERAlthough this species the Fuligula fusca of ornithology is a regularwinter visitor to the seas off the British coasts it nowhere approachesin numbers the preceding species It may be readily distinguished fromthe Common Scoter by its very conspicuous white wing bar and lessobservable white spot under the eye otherwise it closely resembles itin general colouration The Velvet Scoters that visit our seas aregenerally observed mixed with the gatherings of the Common Scoter Thehabits of the two species are much alike in some respects verydifferent in others Thus it exhibits the same skill in diving for foodand obtains it under very similar conditions its flight is equallyrapid and well sustained it seldom visits the land and is when on itjust as clumsy and waddling in its gait its food is similar itsmigrations take place at much the same periods On the other hand theVelvet Scoter is not such a strictly maritime species being frequentlyfound on inland waters and even during winter is partial to wanderingup tidal rivers and visiting lakes Its breedingplaces are also as arule much farther from the sea and the nest is not unfrequently foundat long distances from any water at all Odd pairs of this Scoter areoccasionally met with in our area during the summer and it has beensuggested that the species even breeds within the British limits nodirect evidence however is forthcomingThis Scoter is a late breeder its eggs not being laid before the end ofJune or even early in July Although migrating in flocks the birdsappear to separate into pairs as soon as the summer quarters arereached The duck and drake keep close company as usual until the eggsare laid after which the latter leaves his mate to bring up the broodalone The Velvet Scoter breeds in the Arctic and subArctic regions ofEurope and Asia from the Atlantic to the Pacific and winters intemperate latitudes The breedingplaces are chiefly situated on thetundras amongst scrub or coarse vegetation near the rivers and lakesThe scanty nest of dry grass and dead leaves is often made under somebush and before incubation commences is lined with down from the bodyof the female The eight or nine eggs are greyishbuff in coloursmooth and with little gloss As soon as the young are capable offlight a movement south is made                              SCAUP DUCKThis Duck the Anas marila of Linnus or Fuligula marila of modernnaturalists derives its trivial name from its habit of frequenting themusselscaups or musselscalps and is tolerably abundant round theBritish coasts during winter The adult male is distinguished by havingthe head and neck black shot with metallicgreen and purple and theback and scapulars vermiculated with white and black The general colourof the female is brown shading into grayishwhite on the belly whilsta broad white band extends round the base of the bill Scaup Ducks beginto arrive off our more northern coasts in September but not until amonth later in the south They begin to leave us again in March and themigration continues through the whole of April into May the bird thusbeing one of the last Ducks to retire north in spring Although by nomeans unfrequently met with on inland waters during migration and inwinter the Scaup Duck is for the most part a dweller on the searesorting by preference to bays estuaries and the mouths of largerivers especially where a considerable amount of mud is left bare atlow water It is gregarious at this season often congregating intolarge flocks and not unfrequently associates with other Sea Ducksnotably with Wigeon and Pintail It is a most expert and ready diverspends most of its time upon the water and appears always to prefer todive rather than to fly in avoiding pursuit If compelled to takewing it rises with much splashing but when once fairly in the air iscapable of rapid flight the quicklybeating pinions making a whistlingor rustling sound The food of the Scaup Duck consists largely ofmolluscs but crustaceans and marine plants are also eaten by thisspecies When thus diving for food the bird often remains below for aminute at a time It feeds much at night and passes pretty regularlyfrom its usual haunts by day to its feedingplaces The note of thisDuck is a most harsh and discordant scaup but during flight orcourtship a hoarse and grating kurr is utteredThe Scaup Duck arrives at its Arctic breedinggrounds with the breakupof the ice The bird may probably pair for life as the sexes keep closecompany all the year Even at its breedinggrounds it is a social birdmany pairs nesting in a small area and collecting at certain spots tofeed Its breedinggrounds are on the Arctic tundras near therushandgrassfringed lakes amidst the thickets of birches junipersand willows The nest is placed under a bush or amongst herbage on abank and is merely a hollow lined with dry grass and sedge and deadleaves To this however the usual lining of down is added The eggsfrom six to nine in number are greenishgray and of smooth textureThe female as usual takes sole charge of the young The Scaup Duckinhabits during summer the Arctic regions of Europe Asia andAmerica drawing southwards in winter almost to the tropics                              TUFTED DUCKThis species the Anas fuligula of Linnus and the Fuligulacristata of most modern ornithologists is a fairly common wintervisitor to the British coasts It is not so exclusively a marine speciesas some of the other diving Ducks being often met with on inland watersduring that season The Tufted Duck derives its name from the bushycrest or tuft of feathers growing from the top of the head and droopingdown over the back of the neck on the male The head neck and crestare glossy black shot with purple and green the upper parts thebreast and the under tail coverts are black the remainder of theunderparts and the alar speculum are white In the female the black isreplaced by dark brown and the white with brownishgray the whitespeculum remains Many Tufted Ducks breed and are apparently residentin our islands in certain inland districts but the majority of thebirds that occur round the coasts are migrants from the north This Duckbegins to arrive off the British coasts towards the end of October andcontinues to do so into November It remains in our area until thefollowing spring passing north in March and April Its principal hauntsare the more lowlying coasts especially in the vicinity of estuariesand mudbanks It is gregarious enough at this season some of theflocks consisting of many thousands of birds In its habits generallyit very closely resembles the Scaup Duck a species whose company itoften keeps It swims in much the same low manner dives with equallymarvellous adeptness and shows the same propensity for keeping well outto sea during the day coming shorewards and into shallower water atnight to feed It rises from the sea in the same apparently labouredway striking the water with its feetthe splashing thus made by a flockof birds being audible for a long distance Its alarm note during winteris a harsh kurr but the bird is not a very noisy one The food ofthis Duck consists of molluscs small fish and the roots stemsleaves and buds of various water plantsall of which is obtained bydiving the bird sometimes remaining beneath the surface for as long asa minuteThe Tufted Duck retires to inland waters for the summer its favouriteresorts being meres lakes and marshy grounds full of small ponds Apartiality is also shown for small pools on heaths or fairlywelltimbered ground This Duck probably pairs for life in the breedingseason it is certainly social many males consorting together and manyfemales making their nests within a small area The nest is usually madein a tussock of sedge beneath a bush or amongst rushes and coarsegrass and is a mere hollow lined with a little dry vegetation and anabundance of down from the female The eggs are usually from eight toten in number and greenishbuff They are laid according to localityfrom April to June The female alone brings up the young Outside ourislands the Tufted Duck breeds in the Arctic or temperate parts ofEurope and Asia visiting the southern portions of those continents aswell as North Africa during winter                                POCHARDThis handsome Duck the Anas ferina of Linnus and the Nyroca orFuligula ferina of modern writers is another winter visitor to theBritish Islands where however it breeds locally and in somewhatlimited numbers thus coming within the category of our residentspecies In some districts the male of this Duck is known as theRedheaded Poker the female as the Dunbird or Dunker The coloursof this Duck are very distinctive The head and neck of the male arerich chestnut the back scapulars and flanks are white finelypencilledor vermiculated with black the gorget and tail coverts are black theundersurface grayishwhite the quills brown The female has the headand neck reddishbrown the chin white and the remainder of the plumagemuch browner and more dingy than in her mate The Pochard is by no meansexclusively a marine Duck in fact this species appears to be as muchattached to freshwaters as to the sea Unfortunately there is onething about most of these Sea Ducks which does much to detract fromtheir interest and that is they cannot readily be observed from theshore and appear upon our seas at a season when the elements render thecoast least attractive Most of these Ducks lie well off the land wherethe wildfowler alone is tempted to follow them or if approaching theshore more closely it is generally during rough tempestuous weatherwhen all but the enthusiastic naturalist and the gunner prefer to remainwarm and comfortable at home The Pochard is no exception in thisrespect It arrives along our coasts in October and remains with usuntil the following March It is thoroughly aquatic in its habitsrarely visiting the land feeding both by day and by night chiefly thelatter and often flying for considerable distances about dusk towaters where food is abundant Although its flight at first is slowand laboured it soon becomes very rapid and the quicklybeating wingsmake a rustling sound very characteristic of this species The Pochardis another expert diver and by this means obtains most of its foodvisiting the bottom and bringing up masses of weeds to eat them on thesurface On the coast its food largely consists of crustaceans andmolluscs as well as marine plants The note of this species is a loudand harsh kurrThe haunts of the Pochard in summer are large and open sheets of watersurrounded by a luxuriant growth of sedge rush iris and similarplants or situated on higher ground clothed with heath gorse andcoarse grass It is a social bird during the breeding period severalfemales often nesting close together The nest is always made near freshwater and in many cases absolutely floats on rafts of fallen androtting vegetation several yards from the bank or rests in some tussocksurrounded by shallow water A bed of iris or a crown of rushes isanother favourite spot It is made of dry grass and fragments of anyaquatic vegetation obtainable and lined with down from the femalesbody The eggsusually from eight to twelve sometimes morearebrownishgray As is usual among Ducks the female alone brings up thenumerous family This Duck is widely distributed over many parts ofEurope Northern Asia and North America the birds of the lattercontinent being regarded by some ornithologists as a distinct species                              GOLDENEYEMisled by the variations of colour due to age sex or season in thisspecies Linnus described different examples of it under the names ofAnas clangula and A glaucion whilst even in our own day thefemales and immature birds are known as Morillons and regarded asdistinct from the muchrarer adult males or GoldenEyes which arelocally termed Rattle wings or Whistlers from the noise produced bythe wings during flight The GoldenEye forms the type of thewellmarked genus Clangula of Fleming and of Boie and is known tomost modern ornithologists as C glaucion The male is a singularlystriking and beautiful bird with the general colour of the upper partsblack shot with metallicgreen tints on the head which is adorned witha small yet distinct drooping crest with a large white patch at thebase of the bill under each eye and with the drooping elongatedscapulars and the underparts white The female is much lessconspicuous the black being replaced by dark brown the elongatedscapulars are wanting and the spot under the eyes only faintlyindicated The white double alar speculum is however very stronglymarked in both sexes The GoldenEye is certainly more addicted tofreshwater than the sea and in most cases only quits these inlandlakes and ponds when continued frost compels it to do so It thenprefers such coasts as are lowlying especially delighting inestuaries It usually arrives in the British Islands in October andremains in them until the following April or May It is not sogregarious as some of the other Ducks and generally assembles inparties rather than in flocks the larger gatherings being caused byexceptional circumstances Its habits very closely resemble those ofallied birds It is seldom seen on the land and there walks with thewaddling gait peculiar to most Ducks on the water however it isactive and graceful enough swimming well and diving with greatcelerity usually seeking by this means to escape from danger The noteof this Duck is a low croaking kurr uttered both when the bird isflying and when at rest Its food consists of crustaceans molluscssmall fishes and various water plants and weeds Most of this isobtained by diving and whilst a flock of birds is feeding severalindividuals keep watch all never diving togetherThe evidence for this Duck having bred in Scotland is neither reliablenor conclusive The Goldeneye breeds throughout the Arctic andsubArctic regions of Europe Asia and America up to the limits of thegrowth of trees its winter range extends to the tropics It retires toits northern summer haunts with the first signs of spring The favouritebreeding resorts of this Duck are tracts of more open forest countrywhere the woods are full of swamps and lakes and the timber containsplenty of holes The nest is usually made in a hollow tree in a hole inthe trunk or in a hollow branch sometimes as many as thirty feet fromthe ground whilst the partiality of the bird for a tree near awaterfall or running stream has been noticed by more than oneobserver The nest consists entirely of the down plucked from thefemales body The ten or twelve eggs are laid in May or June and arebright green in colour The nesthole is never made by the Duck itselfThe peasants of Northern Scandinavia place hollow logs in suitableplaces on the treetrunks which the GoldenEyes appear readily to availthemselves of and from which the eggs and down are systematicallytaken The young are conveyed to the ground one by one pressed betweenthe females bill and her breast The male is not known to assist in thetask of incubation but may possibly do so                           LONGTAILED DUCKThis beautiful and remarkably elegant species the Anas glacialis ofLinnus and the Fuligula or Harelda glacialis of modern writers isanother winter visitor to the British seas It is only of somewhat rareoccurrence in our southern waters but northwards off the Scotchcoasts it becomes more frequent and in certain localitiesnotably theHebrides and the Orkneys and Shetlandseven abundant In the latterislands it is locally known as the Calloo in other parts of Scotlandthe clear gabbling cry of this Duck has been freely translated into thewords coalancanlelicht To many American gunners the bird isknown as Old Squaw from its oftrepeated cries The male bird issingularly graceful in appearance his long black central tail feathersprojecting five inches beyond the remaining white ones The head andneck are white but on either side below the ears is a dark browncircular patch the gorget and the upper parts generally are blackagainst which however the long elongated white scapulars are veryconspicuous the underparts below the gorget are white The female ismuch less showy the black parts in the male being dark brown in thissex and the white parts are suffused with brown the elongatedscapulars are wanting During exceptionally severe weather theLongtailed Duck sometimes approaches our coasts in unusual numbers andin districts where it is generally a scarce bird This Duck is a latemigrant seldom reaching even our most northerly coasts before NovemberIt returns north in April It is strictly marine in its haunts duringwinter often wandering long distances from land and approaching theshore usually under pressure of stormy weather Then it shows a decidedpreference for rockbound coasts frequenting the creeks and inletswhich afford a considerable amount of shelter The Longtailed Duck isgregarious at this season like most of its kind although the flocksare seldom or never so large as the gatherings of Scoters and othersIts flight is remarkably quick the long tail making the bird lookextremely elegant It is also an expert diver disappearing as quick asthought and often going for long distances beneath the surface like aGrebe or a Shag It obtains most of its food by diving and like theEider often comes shorewards with the tide It feeds in deeper watertoo than many of its allies as much of its prey is captured not atthe bottom but floating in the sea This food consists of smallmolluscs crustaceans minute marine animals insects and water plantsand weeds Its note may be described as a loud callooooThe Longtailed Duck breeds in the Arctic regions of Europe Asia andNorth America above the limits of forest growth and possibly as farnorth as land exists During summer it frequents inland pools andlakes odd pairs taking possession of the former many pairscongregating on the latter The birds arrive in the Arctic regions withthe breakup of the ice congregating in the pools amongst the floesThe nest is usually placed in some sheltered nook amongst birch andwillow scrub in long grass or on the drifted rubbish by the banks ofthe subsided rivers It is little more than a hollow lined with downIn this during June or early July from seven to twelve buffishgreeneggs are laid by the female It is a most remarkable fact that the drakeof this species assists the duck in bringing up the young but not sofar as I can learn in incubating the eggs During the whole breedingseason this Duck is remarkably tame loth to take wing and swimming outinto the centre of the lake for safety if threatened by danger Thewinter migrations of this Duck are not very extended the MediterraneanBasin perhaps marking the extreme southern limits                              MERGANSERSThe Mergansers are a welldefined little group of fisheating Ducksforming the subfamily Mergin They are characterised by their slendernarrow bill furnished on both upper and lower mandible with sawlikelamell or denticulations The head is always more or less crested inmost other respects they resemble the Diving Ducks all the speciesseeking for their food by diving The sexes differ in colour of plumagebut not perhaps to such a marked extent as in some other divisions ofthe Anatid Six species of Mergansers are known to science of whichfour are included in the British listone as a rare visitor from NorthAmerica Of the remaining two species one inhabits South America theother the Auckland Islands The young as usual are hatched coveredwith down and able soon to follow the female to the water In theirmoulting and progress to maturity they resemble preceding species                        REDBREASTED MERGANSERThis handsome seabird the Mergus serrator of Linnus and most modernornithologists is unfortunately a winter visitor only to Englishwaters In Scotland and Ireland however it is one of the most familiarcoast birds all the year round The Redbreasted Merganser cannotreadily be confused with any other Duck The crested head and upper neckare black shot with green and purple the lower neck and upper breastare buff streaked with black the feathers on the sides of the breasthaving broad black margins the flanks are strongly vermiculated withblack the back is black vermiculated with gray on the lower portionsthe inner scapulars are black the outer ones white the speculum iswhite barred with black and the underparts except the flanks arewhite The female has the head and neck reddishbrown and the upperparts brown the blackbordered feathers on the sides of the breast areabsent Although found in many inland districts the favourite resortsof the Redbreasted Merganser are wild rocky coasts such as containplenty of quiet bays and creeks and lochs studded with islands Waterswhere the bottom is sandy or rocky are preferred to those in which itis composed of mud Many birds of this species visit our coasts for thewinter from more northern haunts whilst some of those dwelling inScottish waters draw southwards at that season This Merganser is moreor less gregarious and may be met with in flocks out at sea or duringrough weather sheltering nearer the land in lochs Early in spring andonwards through the summer the Redbreasted Merganser lives closely inpairs flying and feeding in company I have noticed that this birdvisits certain spots to feed very regularly according to the state ofthe tide almost to the minute I could depend upon certain pairs passingcertain spots on their way to these feedinggrounds I know of fewprettier sights than the actions of a pair of Mergansers in some quietdeep sea loch in early summer The birds swim side by side close inshorebelow the rocks first one diving and then another rarely if everboth descending at the same time when feeding but when engaged incourtship the drake will pursue the duck and splash about in the waterin a most uproarious way often diving after her in the eagerness of hischase The bird swims well if rather low in the water and dives headforemost with a leap just like the Shag The food of this speciesconsists largely of fish but crustaceans crabs especially andmolluscs are also devoured Most of this food is obtained whilst divingeach capture being brought to the surface to be swallowed the birddrinking after doing so and not unfrequently rising three parts out ofthe water and flapping its wings The note is a guttural kurr heardchiefly during flight The bird flies well and rapidly when once freefrom the water but often flaps along the surface for several yardsbefore that is accomplishedThe Redbreasted Merganser breeds in May the eggs being laid during thelatter half of that month and the first half of June Although notgregarious during this period it is at any rate social for severalpairs may be found nesting very close together if keeping somewhat tothemselves An island is always preferred to the mainland The nest isplaced under a rock or bank in a rabbit burrow or amongst denseheather and gorse at no great distance from the water In many cases theeggs are laid upon the bare ground in others a few dry vegetablefragments are collected into a slight hollow but a plentiful bed ofdown gradually accumulates around them From eight to twelve olivegrayeggs are laid upon which the female alone sits The male however isin attendance on the water near by and the duck joins him there duringthe short periods that she leaves her charge to feed and to bathe Ifalarmed the hen bird slips off very quietly When the young are hatchedthe drake retires to moult and the female brings them up unaidedOutside our islands this Merganser is widely distributed over thenorthern parts of Europe Asia and America drawing southwards inwinter                               GOOSANDERAs this beautiful Duck the Mergus merganser of ornithologists notonly occurs in some numbers in British waters as a winter visitor butbreeds sparingly within our limits it has some claim to be included inthe present volume although it cannot be regarded as a very strikingfeature in coast bird life It is also far less exclusively marine thanthe preceding species The Goosander is an even more handsome bird thanthe Redbreasted Merganser and is the largest species in the presentsubfamily The colours of the male are arranged in a most effective andstronglycontrasted way The head and neck are dark metallicgreen thebreast is a delicate and beautiful pink the upper parts and the wingsare black and white the under parts below the breast white The femalehas the head reddishbrown the upper parts grayishbrown or palechestnut the lower buffishwhite In its habits and in the haunts itfrequents the Goosander very closely resembles its smaller ally Whenin winter frequenting the coast it delights in the bays and fjords butoccasionally wanders to less precipitous shores notably estuaries andthe mouths of tidal rivers It is a remarkably agile bird in the waterswimming and diving with equal ease but on the land its movements areungainly the bird wriggling along with its breast almost touching theground in a very Diverlike manner In diving it often descends to agreat depth Although not often seen much on shore it possesses theCormorantlike habit of basking on some rock jutting from the watersitting with its body upright and wings half expanded Its food consistsof fish crabs molluscs and aquatic insects Most of this is obtainedwhilst the bird is divingThe Goosander in our islands is as yet only known to breed in a fewlocalities in the Highlands Its eggs are laid during April and May Itsfavourite nesting haunts are open swampy forests containing lakes androcky streams The nest is generally made in a hole in a tree butcrevices in rocks or cavities in exposed tree roots by the water sideare sometimes selected But little nest is made although when the fullclutch of eggs is deposited a thick and abundant bed of down surroundsthem The eggs are from eight to twelve in number creamy white andglossy It is not known whether the drake assists in the duty ofincubation The Goosander has a wide geographical range which extendsover Arctic and North temperate Europe Asia and America and moresouthern areas during winter                                 SMEWThis species the Mergus albellus of systematists is not only thesmallest of the Mergansers but by far the least common in Britishwaters Its visits are chiefly confined to the eastern coast line ofEngland and Scotland and the south coast of England Even in these areasadult malesfrom their stronglycontrasted blackandwhite plumagelocally known as Nunsare much more rarely met with than females andyoung birds called by the gunners of the east coast Redheaded SmewsUnfortunately the male Smew is a bird that does not approach the coastmuch and the female from her duller colouration and small size isreadily overlooked Lastly it is the least maritime of the family Themale Smee or Smew in nuptial plumage is black and whitesome of theformer colour displayed in curious crescentic markings on the shouldersand in front of the wings the elongated crest is pearly whiteemphasised by greenish black and the flanks are finely vermiculatedwith gray The female has the head reddishbrown During winter the Smewis gregarious living in flocks of thirty or forty individuals mostlyimmature It prefers the more open water at some distance from shoreseeking to evade pursuit by swimming but if fired at diving at onceand reappearing far out of danger When feeding most of the birds diveat once rising in scattered order but soon bunching together as eachbird swims to a central rallying point The Smew does not visit the landmuch and even sleeps upon the water It is a most accomplished diverdescending to great depths and using its wings to assist it through thewater which it traverses with as much ease as a Cormorant or an AukUpon our coasts its food consists principally of small fishes andcrustaceans Its note is a harsh kurr but at its breeding grounds itis said to utter a belllike call hence in Northern Asia it has beencalled the Bell DuckThe Smew breeds in the forest swamps of the Arctic regions making itsnest in a hollow fallen log or in a hole in a tree or stump The eggsare laid upon the powdered wood but are eventually surrounded with aquantity of down from the body of the parent The seven or eight eggscreamywhite in colour are laid late in June or early in July Theducklings are said to be conveyed to the water by the female in herbill                                 GEESEThe Geese form an extensive and welldefined subfamily of the Anatidtermed Anserin They are distinguished from their allies by having thelores covered with feathers and the tarsus reticulated back and frontThe Geese differ further from the Swans in having a relatively longertarsus and much shorter neck and from the Ducks by their shortrobust subconical bill Geese frequent both land and water inlanddistricts as well as the coasts and seas The sexes do not present suchstriking contrasts of colour as in the Ducks Geese moult once in theyear in autumn The distribution of the subfamily is almost acosmopolitan one but the New World contains the greatest number ofspecies Halfadozen species are more or less abundant visitors to ourislands in winter but one species only breeds within our limits andeven this has been extirpated from most of its ancient haunts Thesehalfdozen species divide themselves into two distinct groups four ofthem consisting of the Gray Geese and two the Black Geese The birds inthe former group are the least maritime in their haunts visiting theland to feed whilst those in the latter division are inseparablyassociated with the sea during their sojourn in our area As the formergroup contains the familiar Wild Goosewhich is the original stockfrom which the farmyard Goose has been derivedwe will deal first withthe species contained in it                            GRAY LAG GOOSEThis fine bird the type of the genus Anser and the Anser cinereusof most modern writers claims distinction not only as being the originof the domestic race but as the one species indigenous to the BritishIslands For nearly a hundred years however the Gray Lag Goose hasceased to breed in its old haunts the English Fens it continues tobreed yet very locally in the Hebrides and in certain parts of theHighlands Its domestication must extend to a very ancient date yetcaptivity beyond increasing its size and its fecundity has caused buttrifling variation in its colour The bird therefore must be toofamiliar to every reader to require any description here Onceapparently so common the Gray Lag Goose is now one of our rarest birdsa fact of great significance to the student of the geographicaldistribution or dispersal of species The derivation of one of thisbirds trivial namesLaghas given rise to much speculation untilProfessor Skeat[6] apparently solved the riddle by suggesting that thewordwhich is an equivalent for lateapplied to the birds habit oflagging behind to breed in the Fens after other migratory Geese haddeparted north A few Gray Lag Geese locally appear chiefly on oureastern seaboard in winter and it is more than probable that normallymost of these birds are the individuals still continuing to inhabit theBritish Islands These birds generally resort to the coast frequentingsandbanks and low islands during the day as a safe retreat in which torest and sleep coming landwards again at dusk to feed This Goosealthough gregarious during winter seldom or never consorts with otherspecies although ready enough to mingle with its tame descendants onthe stubbles and pastures Where not persecuted this Goose is a dayfeeder but incessant shooting has caused it to vary its habits in thisrespect and to defer its visits to dangerous grounds until darkness hasset in It shows little partiality for water only resorting theretowhen alarmed or during the helpless period of its moult when itsquills all drop out together and incapacitate it for flight It swimswell and buoyantly however and when wounded has been known to diveThe flight of this species is both rapid and powerful the birds usuallyforming into Vs or Ws to perform their journeys The callnote is aloud farsounding gaggag variously modulated on differentoccasions Its food consists largely of grass and tender grain plantsbut grain of all kinds is sought together with various buds and leavesThe Gray Lag Goose breeds early in some localities the eggs being laidin March or April a month later in the more northern districts It is asocial bird at this period and numbers of nests are often made closetogether Its breeding grounds are secluded moors and swamps The hugenest made on the ground is placed amongst heath or dense vegetationand is composed of branches of heather dry grass rushes brackenturf and so on and lined with down The six or eight eggs arecreamywhite The gander keeps guard close to the nest whilst the gooseincubates the eggs and when the young are reared a move is usually madeseawards                          WHITEFRONTED GOOSEThis Goose the Branta albifrons of Scopoli but the Anser albifronsof most modern writers is a winter visitor to our islands not onlylocal in distribution but much more abundant in some years than othersIt may be readily distinguished from the preceding species by itsorangeyellow bill white face a narrow and varying line of whitefeathers round the base of the bill and broad black bars across thebelly It is perhaps most abundant on the Irish coasts those of thesouth and southwest of England coming next whilst on the east coastaregion so famous for Wild Fowlit becomes rare In Scotland itsprincipal resorts are in the Outer Hebrides The habits of all theseGray Geese are very much alike During winter the present species isgregarious and passes with great regularity from the sandbanks whereit rests and sleeps to the more inland pastures where it feeds Itsfood flight and actions generally resemble those of allied birds Thenote is said to be more harsh and cackling than that of the precedingspecies hence the name Laughing Goose applied in many places to thisbirdThe Whitefronted Goose breeds in the Arctic regions and was met withby Middendorff breeding in great numbers on the Siberian tundras Thenest was a mere hollow at the summit of a grassy knoll lined with downThe eggs from five to seven in number are creamywhite                              BEAN GOOSEThis species the Anas segetum of Gmelin and the Anser segetum ofmodern ornithologists is locally distributed round the British coastsduring winter but of more general occurrence on passage especially inautumn The Bean Goose may be distinguished from the two preceding Geeseby the colour of its bill which has only the central portionorangeyellow the base and the nail being black This species arrivesin our area during October and November It is gregarious during wintercongregating in flocks of varying size which wander about considerablyinfluenced by the exigencies of the weather and the supply of foodThese gatherings are difficult to approach During the day the BeanGeese come inland to search for their food on the stubbles andnewlysown grain lands A longcontinued frost will keep them to thecoast but during spells of open yet rough and stormy weather theyprefer to remain in inland haunts from which however they soon departat the sign of a coming frost When feeding Bean Geese generallystation sentinels to guard the flock by giving timely notice of theapproach of an enemy Their food consists of grass grain tender shootsof grain and the roots of various plants During night when they arecertainly more easily approached they repair to sand banks and lowislands or to the open sea where they sleep and preen their feathersThis Goose swims well but rises from water in a somewhat labouredmanner Its note is the familiar gaggag variously modulatedaccording to circumstancesThe Bean Goose breeds on the Arctic tundras beyond or near the limitsof forest growth across Europe and Asia from the Atlantic to thePacific The nest is made early in June amongst the tall grass andsedge of an islet on one of the tundra lakes or on rising ground on thebank and is merely a hollow into which is gathered a little dry grassand a quantity of down from the body of the parent In this nest threeor four creamywhite eggs are laid As soon as the young are halfgrownthe Bean Geese begin to collect into flocks again and to complete theirmoult Like other Geese at this time they are very helpless beingincapable of flight as the quills drop out suddenly and nearly alltogetherAllusion must here be made to the Pinkfooted Goose the Anserbrachyrhynchus of Baillon long confounded with the Bean Goose andperhaps only subspecifically distinct from it As pointed out by MrCecil Smith the characters mainly depended upon to distinguish thisbird from the Bean Goosepink legs and central portion of the billarenot constant but this may be due to accidental reversion A moreimportant difference because apparently constant is the bluishgraycolour of the upper wing coverts These however are questions that donot come within the scope of the present volume and must be left to themore advanced students of birds The Pinkfooted Goose is a tolerablycommon winter visitor to our islands especially to the easterndistricts Its habits are not known to differ in any important respectBut little is known of its habits during the breeding season The nestis said to be made on low rocks near the sea or on higher cliffs in thefjords some distance inland The four or five eggs are creamywhite                              BRENT GOOSEThe Black Geese differ in many important respects from their alliesthe Gray Geese and are generally separated from them under thescientific terms of Bernicla or Branta These birds arecharacterised by their short subconical bills in which the lamellare concealed or nearly so and by the general dark colour of theplumage relieved by white or in some cases variousstronglycontrasted colours Two species are British in the sense ofvisiting us during winter The first of these the Brent Goosethe Anserbrenta of Brisson and the Bernicla brenta of modern naturalistsisby far the most common and widely distributed of the Geese in ourislands but it exclusively confines itself to the sea It may be metwith off almost all parts of our coastline but is most abundant alongthe east and south The adult bird may readily be distinguished by thegeneral black colouration of the breast and upper parts relieved bysmall white patches on the sides of the neck the pale margins to thewing coverts and mantle and the white upper tail coverts The lowerparts below the breast are dark slategray many of the feathers havingpaler margins Young birds however do not display the white neckpatches The Brent Goose is seldom seen in any numbers on our seasbefore October but from that date onwards vast flocks continue toarrive and the bird continues abundant until the end of the followingMarch Certainly some districts are far more favoured by this speciesthan others In my own experience I may name the Wash where I have seenthis Goose in such enormous packs as densely to cover many acres ofmudflat whilst their noisy clamour in the still hours of earlymorning could be heard for a mile or more across the wide desolatesaltmarshes The Brent Goose passes its time either on the sea or onthe muds It is remarkably gregarious young and old congregatingtogether wary and watchful always and never allowing a close approachon the land So densely do the birds pack that a disturbed flock takingwing looks as though the very surface of the mud or sea were rising inone solid inseparable mass The principal food of this Goose consistsof grass wrack and laver On certain mudbanks these plants grow verythickly and to these the Brents resort as soon as the tide recedessufficiently for them to reach and to tear up their favourite food Instudied order the birds advance feeding as they come sentinelsremaining on the lookout in turn until all are satisfied or theincoming tide covers their foodplants Then back in a solid mass theygo towards the open sea or to some low bank there to rest and preentheir plumage and to wait until another tide has ebbed and leftexposed their pastures This bird for the most part is a day feederbut during moonlight nights it will visit the exposed banks doubtlessthe tide having considerable influence on its habits in this respectThe flight of this Goose if rather laboured is powerful andwellsustained and during its progression the birds often form into Vsor Ws or some other lineal pattern The note of the Brent Goose is aloud oftrepeated and variouslymodulated hank or honk utterednot only when the bird is on the ground but during flightBut very little is known of the nidification of the Brent Goose Itbreeds in the highest Arctic latitudes selecting if possible anisland near the coast making a rude nest in some hollow in the groundof dry grass stalks of plants and moss and warmly lined with downThe four or five eggs are creamywhite in colour The gander keeps watchand ward near the nest whilst the goose incubates the eggs By the endof July most of the Brent Geese begin to moult and during some part ofthe time they are quite incapable of flight At this critical periodthey keep closely to the sea Mr TrevorBattye in his interestingbook Icebound on Kolguev gives a graphic description of the way theSamoyeds capture the Brent Goose whilst it is incapable of flightInstinctively aware of their helplessness the Geese endeavour to get tothe sea and on it congregate in large flocks until their quills havegrown But the Samoyeds cleverly surround themoften taking advantage ofa dense seafog to do soand quietly drive them into a netted enclosureon the shore where they are killed at leisure One of these granddrives witnessed by Mr TrevorBattye resulted in the capture ofupwards of three thousand Brents A form or variety of the Brent Goosewith the under parts below the breast nearly white is commonly foundconsorting with birds of the typical colour It is the Berniclaglaucogaster of Brehm and as far as is known breeds only in theNearctic region It is not known to differ in its habits from the moretypical form                            BERNACLE GOOSEThis somewhat larger species the Anas leucopsis of Bechstein and theAnser leucopsis of most modern naturalists is a fairly common wintervisitor to the British coasts where it is most abundant on the westernlittoral from Cornwall up to the Hebrides Unlike the Brent theBernacle Goose frequently wanders inland to winter on large sheets offreshwater This Goose is readily distinguished by its white cheeksand much lighter underparts below the breast Owing to peculiarities ofdistribution rather perhaps than to choice the Bernacle Goosefrequents more rocky coasts than its ally It is also just asgregarious but owing to the nature of its food is more of a landspecies and certainly more nocturnal in its habits Althoughfrequenting sandbanks and mudflats to sleep and to rest it does notobtain much food upon them Its food is principally composed of marshgrass and to obtain this it comes up from the sea to the saltings andthe banks of lakes and tidal rivers Its flight and actions generallyvery closely resemble those of the Brent Goose The note is similarNothing is known of the breeding grounds or the nesting habits of theBernacle Goose It has however been known to breed in confinement Theeggs are creamy white                                 SWANSThese large and handsome birds form the small but welldefinedsubfamily Cygnin They may be distinguished from all other species inthe Anatid by having the lores or space between the eye and the baseof the bill bare of feathers and by their reticulated tarsus In thissubfamily as in the Anserin the sexes are nearly alike in colourSwans moult only once in the year in autumn The young birdsknown asCygnetsare hatched covered with down and able to swim In firstplumage they are uniform grayishbrown and unlike the Geese theyappear not to undergo any moult during their first autumn but after themoult which takes place in their second autumn they acquire the purewhite plumage of the adult Although this subfamily contains but sevenspecies probably all referable to one genus its distribution is wideembracing the Palarctic Nearctic Neotropical and Australianregions Besides the Mute Swan two other species are British in thesense of visiting our area to winter                              HOOPER SWANThis fine bird the Cygnus musicus of Bechstein as well as of mostmodern ornithologists is a tolerably common winter visitor to theBritish Islands frequenting inland waters as well as the coasts It isof more frequent occurrence in Scotland than in England or Ireland TheHoopersometimes rendered Whooperor Whistling Swan both names beingderived from the birds notes may be distinguished from its two Britishallies by having the basal portion of the bill extending below thenostrils yellow Like many other species that visit us during winterfrom the high north its numbers vary a good deal in different yearsaccording to the mildness or severity of the winter in regions lyingdirectly north or northeast of our area In periods of long continuedfrost great numbers of this Swan collect off certain parts of ourcoasts driven seawards from inland waters This Swan is rarely seen inBritish waters before October or November whilst in some years it doesnot make its appearance in certain localities before midwinter Itsspring migration northwards lasts through April and May Whilst onpassage the flocks of this species form into some rectilinear figure andfly at vast heights Gtke remarks that at Heligoland this Swan is seenmost frequently during longcontinued frost flights of ten twenty ormore passing in long rows one behind the other uttering their loudclanging cries as they go The flight of this species is rapid andregular the swish swish of the long wings being heard for a longdistance and the birds long neck outstretched There are few moregraceful birds on the water than the Mute Swan with its arched neck andraised plumes yet the Hooper is even ungainly looking the neck beingheld straight Hoopers are shy and wary birds and generally keep wellout from shore except when feeding The food of this Swan is mostly ofa vegetable nature aquatic plants and grasses but insects and molluscsare also eaten Its note sounds almost like the short blast of atrumpet uttered in successionThe Hooper Swan breeds in the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia itsfavourite resorts being the islands in the deltas of the great riversthat flow into the northern ocean or on the banks of the great lakes onthe tundras or beside one of the many creeks or inlets spreading outfrom the main rivers This Swan pairs for life The huge nest iscomposed of coarse grass and other herbage piled up on the ground andoften increased in bulk as incubation proceeds The eggs from three toseven in number are creamywhite in colour and rough in texture                             BEWICKS SWANLong confused with the preceding Swan the distinctness of the presentspecies was recognised by Yarrell who named it Cygnus bewicki inhonour of Thomas Bewick naturalist and engraver on wood known to mostreaders as the author of the British Birds and British QuadrupedsBewicks Swan is only a winter visitor to the coasts and inland watersof the British Islands spending the summer far away in the Arcticregions of Europe and Asia The habits of this Swan are very similar tothose of the preceding species The bird may be distinguished from theHooper by its much smaller size and by the yellow patch at the base ofthe bill being much less in extent never extending below the nostrilsBewicks Swan is perhaps not quite so maritime as the Hooper preferringthe large inland sheets of water and more or less sheltered lochs andfjords to the open sea It is seen in greatest numbers in Ireland andScotland and during severe winters visits us in greatest numbers Atthese times some of the flocks are remarkably large numbering hundredsor even thousands of individuals Its food is not known to differ fromthat of the preceding species its flight is equally rapid and itsnote short and musical has been syllabled as tong Imposing as thesebirds are and by no means rare they can scarcely be classed as veryprominent features of the birdlife of the sea so far as ordinaryobservation goesBewicks Swan reaches its Arctic summer haunts towards the end of MayAlthough its eggs have been obtained on the islands in the deltas of thePetchora and the Yenesay these were taken by unscientific observersMr TrevorBattye so far as I know was the first naturalist to see thenest and take the eggs of Bewicks Swan on the island of Kolguev Thisnestof which he gives a beautiful figure[7]he describes as a moundabout two and ahalf feet high and four and ahalf feet in diameter atthe base perfectly smooth and tapering to the circular top which wasnot more than two feet across It was made of little bunches of greenmoss with a few scraps of lichen and a little dry grass pulled up withthe moss The cavity at the top was lined with dead grass mixed with alittle down This nest contained three eggs These are smaller andwhiter than those of the Hooper                               Petrels[Illustration THE STORMY PETREL Chapter vi]                              CHAPTER VI                                PETRELS  PetrelsCharacteristicsChanges of PlumageFulmar PetrelForktailed  PetrelStormy PetrelManx ShearwaterOf all seabirds the Petrels are the most pelagic They are the birdsof the wide ocean even showing small partiality for narrow seas andchiefly frequenting for breeding purposes only such spots as face thewidest expanses of water They are the most marine of birds yet theyform one of the least apparent features in the birdlife of the sea andmore especially when that birdlife is studied from the coast Theircrepuscular or nocturnal habits during their short visits to the landto breed their sombre hues their low flight just above the waves allcombine in rendering these birds exceptionally difficult of observationThe Petrels present such exclusively distinctive characters that manysystematists relegate them to an order by themselves This order istermed Tubinares because the birds contained in it have the nostrilstubulara character which serves at a glance to distinguish a Petrelfrom all other species Other external characters are their hooked beakwebbed feet and long wings More than a hundred species of Petrels areknown to science which are dispersed throughout the seas and oceans ofthe world The young as far as is known are hatched covered with downbut they remain in the nest until capable of flight These birds moultonce in the year None of the species are very remarkable for brightcolouration although in some the coloursbrown black gray andwhiteare strongly contrasted Several species of Petrel wanderoccasionally to the British seas but only four species breed within ourarea and of these we now propose to treat                             FULMAR PETRELThis Petrel the Fulmarus glacialis of ornithologists is very like asmall gull in appearance and is one of the largest representatives ofits family in the northern hemisphere Although it abounds in variousparts of the British seas and was said by Darwin to be the mostnumerous bird in the world so oceanic is it in its habits that thewanderer by the shore might not catch a glimpse of a single exampleduring the course of an entire year Perhaps this Petrel is morefrequently observed off our eastern coasts than anywhere else except inthe vicinity of its breeding place it is often caught in theflightnets on the Wash and is said to be a common frequenter of thedeepsea fishing grounds in the North Sea Occasionally stormdrivenbirds may be met with close inshore The Fulmar Petrel is one of themost familiar birds of high latitudes following in the wake of whalingvessels and sealers and known to the sailors by the name of MollyMawk In its actions above the sea the Fulmar very closely resembles aGull beating about in the same dilatory manner and searching for anyfood chancing to float upon the surface following in the wake ofvessels for miles to pick up the scraps thrown overboard Its usualfood however appears to be cuttlefish and sorrel It is also verypartial to whale blubber It often alights upon the sea either to restor sleep or to eat its food whilst its flight is not only powerfulbut capable of being sustained for long periods When searching forfood this bird flies close to the waves every now and then glidingalong with wings nearly motionless maintaining its speed with a fewvigorous beats from time to timeThe Fulmar Petrel becomes by far the most interesting at its breedingstations These however are isolated and few In the British areathere is only one important nesting place of this species and that isat St Kildaa group of rocky turfcovered islets that form an idealhaunt for every species of Petrel that frequents the British seas oreven a considerable portion of the North Atlantic A fortnights sojournon St Kilda has made me familiar with many of the Fulmars habitsduring the breeding season It is the bird of all others characteristicof the place one is reminded of its presence in many ways but mostpersistently by the strong smell emitted by this and all birds of thePetrel family and which scents everything and every person on theislands The Fulmar is extremely gregarious during the breeding seasonand many thousands of birds congregate here during the summer It isalso exceedingly attached to its breeding places visiting them seasonby season for time out of mind and very probably pairs for life AtSt Kilda its favourite nesting places are on the downlike cliffsplaces where the soil is deep and loamy and allows the bird to excavatea hollow of varying depth But there is not sufficient accommodation ofthis kind for all and great numbers have to resort to the ledgescrevices and hollows on the face of the beetling cliffs or find a sitein some cranny amongst the rough piledup masses of rock Whereverpossible the Fulmar evidently likes to burrow into the ground but thehole in most cases is not big enough to conceal the bird These hollowsare lined with a little dry grass but in many instances a nest of nokind is made Some of the nests I examined on the bare ledges of thecliffs were made of small bits of rock Vast numbers of nests are madeclose together and from a distance the sitting birdsall blendedtogetherlook like patches of snow The Fulmar lays but a single eggeach season white in colour rough and chalky in texture and with astrong pungent smell which is retained by the shell for years after theegg has been taken This egg is laid in MayThere are few more stirring sights in the bird world than a colony ofFulmars Time can never efface the vivid scene that was presented to meas for the first time I peered over the mighty cliff Connacher andviewed the countless hosts of Fulmars at their nestingplaces Justbefore the summit was reached a few Fulmars could be seen flying abovethe cliff then dropping behind the ridge out of sight When I got tothe top and looked over the scene became grand imposingindescribable The suddenness of it all was wellnigh overpowering Onemoment not a bird to be seen the next countless thousands of driftingbirds flying about in all directions along the face of the cliffspassing to and fro backwards and forwards like snowflakes in a gentlebreeze far as the eye could follow them All the Fulmars drifted to andfro in silence not a single bird uttered a cry No bird flies moregracefully than this Petrel it seems to float in the air withouteffort often passing to and fro for minutes together withoutperceptibly moving its wings They are remarkably tame and confidingbirds flying past one at armslength the brightblack eye contrastingstrongly with the snowy plumage When disturbed by the firing of a gunthe Fulmars and other seabirds leave the rocks in masses so dense thatone is apt to think the entire face of the cliffs is crumbling awayLarge numbers of Fulmars are snared by the natives and upwards of20000 young birds are killed every season at St Kilda which afterthe fat and oil are extracted from them are salted and kept for foodWhen caught the Fulmar vomits a quantity of clear ambercoloured oiland a little flows from the nostrils During the Fulmar harvest inautumn the birds as they are taken are made to vomit this oil intodried gullets of the Gannet which the fowler carries for the purposehung round his waist This oil is valued as a sheep dressing and issaid to be a sovereign remedy for rheumatism The typical race of theFulmar is an inhabitant of the North Atlantic basin ranging southwardsin winter as low as the latitude of New York in the west and Gibraltarin the east                          FORKTAILED PETRELA year after this species was first described by Vieillot under thename of Procellaria leucorhoa it was discovered at St Kilda byBullock This was early in the present century but the islands knowncollectively by that name still continue to be its most famous breedingplace in our area or even in Europe Three years after its discoveryit was rechristened P leachi by the French naturalist Temminck aname which has found favour with many writers The Forktailed Petrel isknown to breed on North Rona and at some other spots in the OuterHebrides as well as on the Blaskets off the coast of Kerry There canbe little doubt that many other breeding stations of this Petrel remainto be discovered This species readily distinguished from the StormyPetrel by its larger size and deeplyforked tail is rarely seen nearthe land unless during the breeding season or when driven thence byboisterous weather I have known it to be caught in the flightnets onthe mudbanks of the Wash whilst it is of tolerably frequent occurrenceelsewhere off our eastern and southern coasts In its habits generallyit very closely resembles its better known ally the Stormy PetrelDuring the nonbreeding season it wanders vast distances from landsleeping and resting on the sea when tired following ships for milesfluttering along close to the ocean now down into the trough of thewave anon skimming over the crest to halffly halfrun with pattingfeet down the smooth surface of the next Except during the breedingseason this Petrel is not very gregarious it may often be seen inparties of perhaps halfadozen scattered over a considerable surfaceof water The exact nature of the food of this species is apparentlyunknown It is said in a vague and general way to feed on crustaceansand small molluscs and the scraps of refuse cast from passing vesselsbut birds which I have dissected contained similar substances to thosefound in the Fulmara nearly clear oil mingled with the jaws ofcuttlefish and scraps of sorrelThe Forktailed Petrel resorts to its breeding stations to nest in JuneAlthough gregarious during this period its colonies are never so largeas those of the Fulmar Most probably the bird pairs for life andreturns season by season to certain spots to rear its young The largestcolony of this Petrel known to me is at St Kilda Here its principalcolony is located on the island of Soay but there is another andsmaller one on Doon and doubtless others on Borreay At the colony onDoon the ground was full of long winding burrows probably disusednesting holes of Puffins and Shearwaters and in these the ForktailedPetrels had made their nestsin some cases one earth accommodatingseveral pairs of birds Usually the selected burrows are in the loamysoil near the summit of the cliffs but in some cases the birds willselect a hole or crevice in ruined masonry or in rocks At the end ofthe burrow or crevice a scanty nest of dry grass is formed but insome cases no provision whatever is made Here the female deposits asingle egg white with a zone of dustlike brown specks round thelarger end These eggs are remarkably fragile and very chalky intexture The Forktailed Petrel is a close sitter remaining broodingover its egg until dragged out Many nests may be found within an areaof a few yards This Petrel is not seen abroad much at its breedingplaces during daylight all day long the little birds skulk in theirburrows but with the approach of night they begin to sally forth fromtheir retreats and nests and their fluttering forms may be seenflitting to and fro in the deepening gloom backwards and forwards toand from the sea The Forktailed Petrel is not a very noisy bird Thosethat I dragged from their nests uttered a few squeaking notes but atnight the species becomes more garrulous But three breeding stations ofthis Petrel are knownone in the North Pacific another in the Bay ofFundy and the third within the British area Its migrations arelimited                             STORMY PETRELThis diminutive species the Procellaria pelagica of Linnus and mostmodern writers and the Mother Careys Chicken of mariners isperhaps the best known of the Petrels that frequent the British seasIt is remarkable for being the smallest webfooted birda nearly blacklittle creature with a white patch on the upper tail coverts Small asthis Petrel is it is just as oceanic in its haunts as its larger andmore robust congeners During boisterous weather especially about theperiod of the equinoctial gales in autumn Stormy Petrels are notunfrequently driven some distance inland and examples of this specieshave been picked up more or less exhausted even in the centre of busytowns At this season it is also noticed a good deal about certainlighthouses at night After rough nights I have seen odd Stormy Petrelsflying over the fishermens cottages like swallows and many of themare or used to be caught in the flightnets in the Wash The actionsof this Petrel at sea are characteristic of its congeners It fliesabout in the same fluttering manner following the curves of the wavesand pattering along their sloping surfaces with its tinywebbed feet Itmay be met with hundreds of miles from land following ships or payinga vessel a short visit then disappearing again lost in the lonelywastes of water It is able to weather many a storm at sea doubtlessobtaining much shelter in the deep hollows of the mighty waves It maybe seen flitting about the stormstirred sea quite at its ease and fromthis fact it is very popularly believed to be a harbinger of badweather and disliked accordingly by sailors Except during the breedingseason the Stormy Petrel rarely visits the land it rests and sleepsupon the sea swimming just as buoyantly as a Duck It is seldom seen toalight however unless to pick up some morsel of food and rarelyremains long upon the water At its breeding stations it is certainlyvery nocturnal in its habits but otherwise it may be seen at all hoursof the day fluttering above the sea Its food probably consists almostentirely of cuttlefish I have dissected many specimens of this Petreland never found anything but oil mixed with sorrel in the stomach Whentaken in the hand the bird usually throws up a drop of this oil orsquirts a little from the nostrils just as the larger ForktailedPetrel will do I have never heard the Stormy Petrel utter a soundexcept at the breeding stations where its note is a noisy twitter Itis more or less gregarious at all times of the year and generally roamsthe sea in small scattered parties but its gatherings are mostextensive at certain of its breeding stationsIt is a difficult matter to specify with any degree of exactness thebreeding stations of such a secretive species as the Stormy Petrel Itmay breed for years in a place and the fact never become known Aspecially interesting instance of this has lately occurred within my ownexperience Lundy Island has long been thought to be the most easterlybreeding station of the Stormy Petrel in England but all the time foraught we know to the contrary it has regularly nested on the Big Rockin Tor Bay where during last season 1895 a young bird was takenand is now preserved in the Torquay Natural History Societys MuseumThe egg had been taken here several years ago with the parent bird thelatest nest owed its discovery to the acuteness of a dog attracted bythe strong smell emitted by this Petrel Here then was the Stormy Petrelbreeding actually within sight of my front windows and I giving LundyIsland and the Scilly Islands as its only nesting places in thevicinity I have seen this Petrel on the whiting grounds outside TorBay and Manx Shearwaters too during summer but where they breed isanother matter so skulking and secretive are their movements near andon the land So far as is known there is no breedingplace of theStormy Petrel on the entire eastern coastline of England and ScotlandThe German Ocean is a landlocked sea and it is more than probable theStormy Petrel breeds nowhere on its coasts but that its nestingplacesextend far up the English Channelmuch further east than Tor Baytherecan be little doubt There are many known breedingplaces of this Petrelfrom the Scilly Islands northwards along the west coast of EnglandWales and Scotland to the Shetlands and many others round the coastsof Ireland The favourite breeding haunts of the Stormy Petrel are rockyislands rising in uneven turfclad downs strewn with masses of rockand stones The bird probably pairs for life and is more or lessgregarious at its breedingplaces The slight nest of dry grass isplaced in an old rabbit earth or Puffin burrow under a rock or heap ofloose stones or in ruins and amongst masonry In some cases no nestwhatever is made The single egg is laid normally in June This is purewhite in ground colour with a faint zone of minute dustlike red specksround the larger end Like all its kindred the Stormy Petrel is a closesitter remaining in its hole until dragged out It is also crepuscularin its habits at its nestingplaces becoming lively at dusk when itmay be seen flitting to and from the sea in a silent batlike manner Sofar as is known the breeding area of the Stormy Petrel is exclusivelyconfined to the islands and coasts of the East Atlantic                            MANX SHEARWATERThe Shearwaters are a welldefined group of Petrels numbering twenty ormore species distinguished by their long slender bill long wings andshort tails As the Fulmars bear a superficial resemblance to the Gullsso may the Shearwaters be compared with the Auks Four of these birdsare known to visit the British seas and coasts but only one of themthe Manx Shearwater Puffinus anglorum is known to breed within ourlimits and to occur in any abundance The upper parts of thisShearwater are black the lower parts white The Manx Shearwater is sofar as is known a resident in the British seas and widely distributedalong our coasts during the season of reproduction Like its allies thePetrels this Shearwater is closely attached to the open sea living forthe most part away from shore and only frequenting land during itsnesting period Its flight is much more erratic and rapid than that ofthe small Petrels or the Gulllike Fulmar and reminds one more of theSwift It may be seen dashing impetuously along close above the wavesthis way and that one moment high above the horizon the next deep downin the trough of the billows pausing here and there for a moment withrapid beating wings legs let down and feet striking the water to pickup some scrap of food During the breeding season it is for the mostpart nocturnal in its habits but at other times it seems to be abroadboth by day and night That it can swim well and buoyantly I know fromabundant experience but whether it dives as some writers assert Iam not prepared to say Some Petrels however are habitually known todo so as for instance the species composing the genus HalodromaShearwaters delight in a rough sea and a brewing storm every bit asmuch as the smaller Petrels no weather seems too boisterous for themWhen on our rough night voyage to St Kilda we must have passedhundreds of Shearwaters holding high carnival above the gray watersflitting round our vessel in weird erratic flight like bird ghoststheir gambols in the gloom being most interesting So far as myexperience extends the food of the Manx Shearwater consists entirely ofcuttlefish and sorrel but the bird will pick up various scraps thrownfrom vessels At St Kilda this Shearwater is regarded as a delicacyThe natives also obtain quantities of oil from itThroughout the summer the Manx Shearwater is nocturnal and at theapproach of darkness becomes very garrulous Its note may be expressedas kittycooroo uttered two or three times in succession and then apause So far as I could determine this note is never uttered by thebird at sea only when flying about its breeding station or in or nearits burrow and is only heard at night At St Kilda the island of Soayis the grand breeding place of this Shearwater The St Kildans visitthis island at times during the breeding season going at nightknocking down the birds as they flutter about and dragging others fromtheir nests Four hundred Shearwaters are sometimes slain thus in asingle nightThe Manx Shearwater is a somewhat late breeder its eggs being laidtowards the end of May or during the first half of June There are noknown breeding places of this bird along the eastern coast line ofScotland and England nor have any yet been discovered on the southcoast of England although I am positive the species nests in the SouthHams of Devon Its breeding area so far as it is known is almostprecisely the same as that of the Stormy Petrel Its favouritenestingplaces are islands with a good ocean aspect covered with turfand soft loamy soil Although gregarious during this period manyscattered pairs breed here and there along the coast The bird probablypairs for life returning year by year to a favourite nestingplace Itusually excavates a long and often winding burrow making a slight nestof dry grass at the end on which is laid a single white egg Both birdsassist in making this burrow which often runs under some mass of rocksand many holes are begun and deserted for no apparent reason just as wefind to be the case with the Sand Martin and other holeboring speciesAt the entrance of all of the holes that are occupied there is aconsiderable heap of droppings Few if any Shearwaters are astir evenat a populous breedingstation during the day all keep closely to theirburrows remaining stolidly upon their nest until dragged forthstruggling into the light Many burrows are made close together and insome cases one main entrance will lead to several chambers eachcontaining a nest                         Littoral Land Birds[Illustration THE CHOUGH Chapter vii]                              CHAPTER VII                          LITTORAL LAND BIRDS  Littoral Land BirdsWhitetailed EaglePeregrine  FalconRavenJackdawHooded CrowChoughRock PipitMartinsRock  DoveStock DoveHeronVarious other speciesOur survey of marine ornithology can scarcely be considered completewithout a brief allusion to the various land birds that reside upon thecoast Many of these birds are perhaps most closely associated withinland districts but others are just as essentially marine Some ofthese species constantly reside by the sea others are but found thereduring the bright summer days whilst others yet again appear duringautumn and winter only Be the shore low sand or marshy sloblandbuttressed by precipitous cliffs or fringed with rocky beaches and opendowns certain land birds form decided features in the scene some ofthem very widely and very generally dispersed In some cases thesespecies show us how very readily birds can adapt themselves to theirsurroundings or reconcile themselves to circumstances finding ascongenial a home on the seaboard as in the woods or fields or evencities of the interior                          WHITETAILED EAGLEHalf a century ago this fine bird the Haliaetus albicilla ofornithologists was very generally distributed round our northerncoasts in earlier years than that it bred in certain parts of Englandpossibly on most of our highest headlands Trap gun and poison havedone their sad work only too well and now the Whitetailed Eagle isbanished almost entirely from the land The birds that still survive aremostly confined to the Hebrides to the wild waste of islands and seaalong the western seaboard of Scotland Occasionally stray birds arenoticed during autumn and winter on the coast of England but theseare almost invariably immature individuals on their migration south TheWhitetailed Eagle almost exclusively frequents maritime districtswhere it may be seen at a vast height soaring on nevertiring wing orstanding on some rock pinnacle It preys upon every bird or animal thatit is able to capturenewlydropped lambs and fawns hares rabbitsgrouse and waterfowl But its favourite fare perhaps iscarrionstranded fish and other garbage on the shore dead sheep and soon This Eagle makes its eyrie on some stupendous ocean cliff and asthe birds pair for life the spot is occupied years in succession Thenest is a huge pile of sticks and branches lined with dry grass wooland other soft material The two eggs laid in March or April arewhite This Eagle may be distinguished from the Golden Eagle by its baretarsi The note is a yelping or barking cry Outside our limits thisbird is found in the northern portions of Europe and Asia from theAtlantic to the Pacific                           PEREGRINE FALCONThis bold and handsome bird the Falco peregrinus of naturalists inspite of much persecution still survives on many of our rocky coastsbecoming most abundant in Scotland and Ireland The favourite resorts ofthe Peregrine are precipitous cliffs especially such as are constantlywashed by the sea From these it not only sallies in quest ofseabirds but flies inland to hunt for prey The dash and courage ofthe Peregrine are proverbial few birds on land or sea escaping fromits fatal swoop Near the coast the food of this Falcon is largelycomposed of Ducks Plovers Sandpipers Pigeons Partridges sea fowland rabbits The flight of the Peregrine when the bird is in the act ofchasing its prey is rapid and full of sudden turns and twists but atother times it is slow and deliberate Witness the aerial gyrations ofthis species above its nestingplace when it may be seen soaring andwheeling in lofty flight Its note heard principally in the vicinity ofthe nest is a loud chattering cry This Falcon probably pairs forlife resorting year after year to one particular cliff to breed eventhough the nest be robbed repeatedly No actual nest is made the threeor four eggs laid in April or early May resting in some slight hollowin the soil on an overhanging ledge in the cliffs They arecreamywhite in ground colour thickly mottled freckled and cloudedwith reddishbrown brickred or orangebrown of various shades Whenflushed from the nest the female becomes very noisy and is soon joinedby the male both then flying about in angry alarm dashing past theface of the cliff from time to time The Peregrine may be readilydistinguished from the other indigenous British Falcons by its superiorsize The upper parts are dark slategray the head and moustachiallines are black the underparts are buffishwhite spotted on the throatand breast and barred on the remainder with blackishbrown ThePeregrine is distributed over most parts of the world but has beendivided into several wellmarked forms or races Two other Raptorialbirds may be met with on the coastone the Kestrel commonly and theother the Buzzard locally                                 RAVENThis species the Corvus corax of naturalists still manages tosurvive and is of tolerably common occurrence in many localitiesFormerly it was commonly distributed over the inland districts but nowespecially in England it is most frequently seen along the coast Hereits favourite retreats and nestingplaces are lofty cliffs From theseits headquarters it roams far and wide not only along the shore butfar inland in quest of food It is a fine sight to see this big sablebird dash out from the cliffs and fly upwards on powerful wingcroaking and barking as it goes or better still when male and femaletoy with and buffet each other high in air uttering a series of shrilland sometimes by no means unmusical notes The Raven feeds on almosteverything in the shape of flesh carrion as well as living creaturesindiscriminatelyThis bird is an early breeder It pairs for life and continues tofrequent one spot for nesting purposes year after year Formerly manyRavens made their nests in trees but now the usual situation is someledge or crevice in a lofty precipice The nest added to or repairedeach season is made of sticks and lined with turf moss wool furand hair and is generally a large bulky structure Five eggs areusually laid bluishgreen blotched and spotted with olivebrown andgray The Raven very closely resembles the Carrion Crow in colour butmay readily be distinguished by its much larger size This bird has avery wide distribution over Europe Northern Asia and North America                                JACKDAWOf all the land birds that frequent the coast this species the Corvusmonedula of Linnus and most other writers is one of the most abundantand best known Colonies of Jackdaws are established on most of ourocean cliffs in some places as at Bempton or Flamborough mixed withseafowl in others apart by themselves The birds frequent thesecolonies all the year round coming inland to feed at intervals eachday returning at nightfall to rest in noisy cackling crowds Sometimesthe birds where circumstances permit may be seen feeding on the beachor rocks below their haunts This bird is more or less gregarious allthrough the year and some of its assemblages consist of severalhundreds of pairs Its food is chiefly composed of worms insects andgrubs but on the coast the bird picks up a variety of creatures fromthe sands There can be little doubt that the Jackdaw pairs for lifeThe same breeding places the same nests are occupied year by year Itis a later breeder than the Rook the eggs being laid during April andMay On the coast the nest is made in crevices and hollows in thecliffs in Tor Bay a small cave is frequented the nests being built incrannies near the roof The nest is composed of sticks turf the stalksof marine plants and litter from the fields lined with dry grassstraws fur wool and feathers Some nests are much larger than othersthe peculiarities of the site determining the size of the structure to agreat extent The four or five eggssometimes halfadozenare paleblue spotted and blotched with olivebrown of different shades andgray The Jackdaw has the general colour of the plumage black shadinginto gray on the nape and sides of the neck                              HOODED CROWThis species the Corvus cornix of Linnus and ornithologistsgenerally is only known as a winter visitor to certain parts ofEngland but is a common resident in Scotland and Ireland From Octoberto March the Hooded Gray or Royston Crow is a very familiar object onthe lowlying coasts of East Anglia Its migrations to this districtfrom the Continent are extremely interesting All day long the birds maybe seen coming in from over the sea in flocks and parties crossing fromcontinental Europe along a due west course Sometimes great flights ofthis Crow pour across the North Seacolumns of migrating birds estimatedto be forty or more miles in breadth and travelling at the enormousspeed of more than a hundred miles per hour All the winter throughHooded Crows frequent the saltmarshes or the grain fields close to thesea The food of the Hooded Crow is not known to differ from that ofallied species the bird being practically omnivorous There are fewinstances known of this Crow breeding in England but elsewhere in theBritish Islands it nests freely In many Scottish and Irish districts itmakes its nest on a seacliff This resembles that of the Raven or theJackdaw being made of sticks twigs turf and stalks lined with mosswool and other soft materials Five eggs are usually laid green ofvarious shades in ground colour spotted and blotched with olivebrownand gray The note of the Hooded Crow is a hoarse kra modulated invarious ways                                CHOUGHFor reasons which have been variously assigned the present species thePyrrhocorax graculus of ornithologists has now become one of therarest and most local of British birds Once fairly common not only incertain inland localities but on the seagirt cliffs many of itscolonies have now become deserted It is a bird of the rockbound coasteasily recognized by its blueblack plumage and long curved red billIt is not necessary here to indicate the places where colonies stillexist The Chough is a gregarious bird and many of its habits resemblethose of the Jackdaw or the Starling Its flight is often curiouslyerratic the bird after rising a little way dropping again with wingsclosed Upon the ground it runs quickly its bright red legs and feetbeing conspicuous The note is very like that of the Jackdaw achuckling or cackling chowchow hence the birds name of Choughwhich by the way is often used with the prefix Cornish although thebird is just as scarce in Cornwall as elsewhere now The food of thisbird is chiefly composed of beetles worms grubs and grain The Choughbreeds in colonies which resort to lofty ocean cliffs especially suchwhere caves and fissures are plentiful The nest is very similar to thatof the Jackdaw and varies a good deal in size Sticks heather stemsand dry stalks of plants form the outside the cavity is lined with drygrass roots wool and similar soft material From four to six eggs arelaid in May creamywhite in ground colour blotched and spotted withvarious shades of brown and gray When disturbed the Choughs fly out oftheir nestholes and behave generally in a very Jackdawlike mannerThe Chough appears to be a sedentary species in all parts of itsdistribution                              ROCK PIPITIn the present bird the Anthus obscurus of ornithologists we haveone of the very few species of Passeres that are confined exclusively tomaritime haunts During the breeding season the Rock Pipit frequents therockbound coasts often resorting to cliffs washed incessantly by thewaves rock stacks some distance from shore and precipitous islandsbut in winter it may be observed on the saltmarshes and stretches ofsand It is an olivebrown little bird on the upper parts streaked withdarker brown the eye stripe and throat are nearly white the remainderof the under parts are sandybuff streaked with brown During flightthe smokebrown patch on the outer tail feathers is very conspicuousDuring autumn and winter Rock Pipits may generally be met with inparties sometimes even in small flocks congregating on the rockybeaches the cliffs and downs or at low water searching amongst theseaweed and shingle for food They are by no means shy birds but ifalarmed rise in scattered order and after flitting aimlessly aboutagain pitch a little farther on and resume their search In spring theRock Pipit separates into pairs the lowlying shores are deserted andthe birds resort to their several breedingplaces In early spring thesimple song of the cock bird may be heard at intervals all the livelongday sometimes uttered as he perches on a big stone or clings to thecliffs hundreds of feet above our heads but more frequently as heflutters in the air The food of this Pipit is composed of insects andworms and small seeds Although small and unobtrusive the Rock Pipitis not easily overlooked It flits before the observer in a waveringuncertain manner uttering its plaintive weet as it goes then alightsa little further on and waits our approach when once more it risescheeping into the air to alight far up the cliffs or turn back toseek its original haunt Although this species pairs early the nest isseldom made before May Few nests are more difficult to find than theRock Pipits hidden as it is under stones or clods of earth or wedgedinto crevices of the rocks and cliffs It is made of dry grass mossscraps of dry seaweed and lined either with horsehair or fine grassThe four or five eggs are dull bluishwhite in ground colour freckledwith grayish or reddishbrown and sometimes streaked withblackishbrown Two broods are often reared in the season the eggs forthe latter being laid in July Many pairs of birds may be found nestingon a short stretch of coast but no gregarious instincts are manifestedat this season The Rock Pipit has a very restricted geographicaldistribution being confined to the European coasts of the Atlanticincluding our islands and the Fares                                MARTINSBoth the species of British Martins resort to many localities on thecoast to breed To the walllike cliffs the House Martin Chelidonurbica often attaches its mudbuilt cradle I know of large coloniesof this Martin on the sea cliffs of Devonshire where the nests areplaced in rows or stuck here and there in every sheltered niche In thesame manner the Sand Martin Cotyle riparia bores its tunnels intothe soft earth at the summit of the sea cliffs or into the solid banksof earth that in some districts take the place of cliffs It is notnecessary to enter here into details of the economy of these MartinsBoth engaging little species add to the life and animation of the coastas they fly to and fro and in and out of their nests Then during theperiod of migration many Martins pass along the seaboard and sometimesthe observer may be fortunate enough to witness their actual arrivalfrom over the sea or their final departure across its lonely expanse                               ROCK DOVEWe here have another exclusively marine species the Columba livia ofLinnus and most modern writers confined to such portions of the coastas are precipitous and full of caves and hollows The Rock Dove may bereadily distinguished from all the other British species of Pigeons byits white lower back and rump and stronglybarred wings As maynaturally be inferred from the cliffhaunting propensities of this Doveit is practically absent from the lowlying eastern coasts of Englandlocal on the south coast but becomes much commoner further north andwest where the cliffs are rugged and lofty and full of those wavewornhollows and fissures that are the Rock Doves delight As most readersmay be aware this species is the original stock from which the numerousraces of dovecot Pigeon have descended Curiously enough this bird isinseparably attached to the coast it is a rockhaunting species andone which rarely or never perches in trees Usually our firstacquaintance with the Rock Dove is made as the startled bird dashes outof the cliffs with rattling wings and impetuous haste It is more orless gregarious all the year round and may frequently be seen in flockson the fields near its native cliffs Its food is composed of grain andseeds of all kinds and the buds and shoots of plants Its flight israpid and well sustained I was told by the natives of St Kilda thatthe Rock Doves frequenting the islands cross the sea every dayadistance of seventy milesto feed on the Hebrides and there can belittle or no doubt about this for St Kilda contains little suitablefood for this grainloving bird Its note is the familiar cooThe Rock Dove is an early breeder congregating in colonies on suchcliffs as afford it the necessary shelter Wherever possible the nestsare made in caves where these are wanting the birds scatter themselvesabout the cliffs and place their nests in any convenient fissure orcleft The bird pairs for life and yearly resorts to the same breedingstations some of the caves gaining a local reputation in this respectThe nest is placed on some ledge or in a cranny and consists of alittle dry grass twigs roots or stems of plants arranged in a flatplatelike form The two eggs are pure white This species may be foundbreeding all the summer through and rears two if not more broods eachseason The Rock Dove is found on almost all parts of the rocky coastsof Europe and the outlying islands                              STOCK DOVEThis Dove the Columba nas of naturalists is very often confusedwith the preceding species from which however it may readily bedistinguished by having the rump uniform in colour with the back andthe wing bars broken up into patches Mistaken identity is also renderedeven more easy by the bird frequenting the coast in just the samelocalities we associate with the Rock Dove As most readers are awarethe Stock Dove is a dweller in wooded inland districts as well as onthe coast I have however often remarked that the two species rarelyinhabit the same parts of the coast and that the Stock Dove showspreference for cliffs that are more or less densely clothed with ivystunted trees and thickets In its flight shyness method of searchingfor food and habits generally when frequenting littoral districts theStock Dove very closely resembles the Rock Dove The note of the StockDove heard most incessantly during spring and summer is howeverdifferent and may be described as a grunting cooooup At all timesthis Dove is socially inclined and becomes to a great extentgregarious during winter its numbers being increased during that seasonby migrants from Scandinavia Its food is chiefly obtained from grainlands clover fields and stubbles and consists chiefly of grain andseeds berries and various shootsThe breeding season of the Stock Dove begins in April and extends overthe entire summer into the succeeding autumn When resorting to maritimecliffs the nest is often placed amongst ivy in a rabbit burrow or ina crevice of the cliffs and is a mere platform of twigs roots orstraws In many cases a nest is dispensed with altogether The two eggsare creamywhite smooth and polished In inland localities a hole in atree or the deserted drey of a squirrel or old nest of a Crow orMagpie is usually selected Several broods are reared in the seasonThis Dove is one of those species that is rapidly extending its area ofdistribution in our islands the trend of its advance however beingalways northerly Outside our limits the Stock Dove is found over mostparts of Europe and NorthWest Africa eastwards to the Caucasus andAsia Minor                                 HERONAlthough this bird the Ardea cinerea of most writers is usuallyassociated with fresh and inland waters it is frequently enough metwith along the coast especially about estuaries saltmarshes and suchportions of the shore where pools are left by the tide amongst the rocksat low water Moreover it sometimes establishes its colonies on marinecliffs or in woods adjoining the sea Although of recent yearsconsiderably reduced in numbers the Heron still justifies the prefix ofCommon which custom generally attaches to it There are few placesround the English coast known to me where the Heron forms such adistinctive feature in the scene as on the wide estuary of the Exe orbut not so abundant on that of the Teign a little lower down theDevonshire coast Sometimes a score or more Herons may be counted heretogether standing like big blue sentinels on the marshes wading in thetidal pools or flying in their slow deliberate way above the flatsMany of these Herons breed in the valley of the Dart Odd Herons mayalso be flushed here and there along more rockbound coasts The flightof this species is very imposing witnessed to perfection as the birdpasses to or from its feeding or fishing grounds and its nightlyretreat in some distant wood or perhaps better still when mobbed bysome Gull or mobbing one in return The Heron feeds largely on fisheseither those from salt or freshwater together with frogs waterinsects and even small mammals The Heron fishing is a perfect pictureof still life an ornament to the shore As a rule the Heron is aremarkably silent bird he fishes like all good anglers in absolutequietness but when passing through the air on his frequent journeyshe often utters a short deep trumpetlike note startling andstrangesounding enough when heard from the evening skyThe Heron breeds locally throughout the British Islands its favouritenesting places being in woods and plantations although a ledge on acliff or a ruin is sometimes selected In many places where the Heronis sufficiently abundant it breeds in colonies like Rooks andresorts year by year to the same localities The nest is usually ahuge pile or platform of sticks the cavity containing the eggssometimes being lined with turf and moss Some nests are much largerthan others the accumulation of years and most are whitewashed withthe birds droppings The eggsthree to five in numberaregreenishblue and chalky in texture When disturbed at their nests thebig birds rise crashing through the branches into the air and sailabout above the place in anxiety until left in peace They utter few orno notes of any kind When the young are nearly full grown they may beseen climbing about the trees using their beak to assist them inpassing from one part of the tree to another The Heron is a bird ofvery wide distribution and is found throughout Europe Africa Asiaand even AustraliaIn conclusion we may remark that there are many other land birds foundupon certain parts of the coast from time to time especially during thetwo great periods of migration in spring and in autumn The above shortlist must not be regarded in any way as being exhaustive It containshowever the most constantly characteristic species Many smallPasserine birds frequent the shoreespecially on our eastern andsouthern seaboard but they are arrivals from other lands and oftenpassing south or north as the case may be to yet more distant hauntsAmong the more prominent of these we may mention the Goldcrest whichoften abounds on the coasts of the German Ocean the Skylark and theStarling that come each year in countless hosts the various Finchesand Thrushes that visit us each season to pass the winter in our landThen more locally there is the Snow Bunting and the Shore LarkArcticbirds that visit us more or less commonly The Common Bunting too is acommon resident on many parts of the littoral area Of other species wemay mention the Shorteared Owl the SparrowHawk the Woodcockmigrantsfrom over the sea tarrying but a short time to rest near the shorebefore speeding inland or yet further south The Rook obtains much ofits food from the sands in littoral districts the Starling oftencongregates in vast flocks on the saltings I have even seen the Rooktake its food from the surface of the sea precisely in the same manneras a Gull                        Migration on the Coast[Illustration

in this  Direction to EastThe Vast Rushes of Birds across the German OceanThe  Perils of MigrationBirds at Lighthouses and Light VesselsNetting  BirdsRare BirdsIn order to make the subject of Birdlife on the Coast complete it isnecessary for us briefly to sketch the phenomenon of Migration as it maybe studied on the shore A person could select no better situation forthe observation of this grand avine movement than the coastUnfortunately however all coasts are not equally favoured in thisrespect and unless a proper selection of locality be made the observerin quest of information will meet with nothing but disappointmentUnquestionably the best portion of the British coastline for the studyof bird migration is that washed by the German Ocean and the EnglishChannel The western districts are everywhere less favourable than theeastern due partly to their much more isolated position and the widerextent of the frontier seas Two reaches of the British coast deservespecial mention for the numbers of migrant birds that frequent themThese are the coasts between the Humber and the Thames and the seaboardof Hampshire Sussex and Kent The observer of migration on the coastwill do well to bear in mind the following facts Many birds do notabsolutely confine their flight to the indentations of the coast butfly from one headland to another so that on the coasts of theintervening bays but little migration may be witnessed Headlands appeareverywhere to be exceptionally favourable points for observationRockbound coasts again are not so much frequented by migrants asthose that are lowlying or present a considerable area of beachwhilst there is some evidence to suggest that where the shore iscomposed of cliffs falling sheer to the water fjords and river valleysare exceptionally favoured During the migration period both in springand autumn the early hours of morning or the dusk of evening will befound to reward observation best Due regard should also be paid to thedirection of the wind and the prevailing state of the weathera changein either being often followed by migratory movementA very large percentage of the birds described in the present volume aremigratory although the seasonal movements of many of the species cannotbe remarked to any great extent by the wanderer along the coast Suchthoroughly aquatic species as the Auks the Petrels the Divers and theGrebes move south or north according to season some distance from theland and it is often only by the chance of rough weather driving thesebirds near to the land that we are enabled to learn that theirmigrations are in progress or that certain species have once morereturned to our area for their winter or summer sojourn therein TheDucks Geese and Swans are birds of migratory habits and in certainlocalities much of their seasonal movements may be observed from theshore Then again the Gulls and Terns although often migrating somedistance from the land may not unfrequently be seen passing up or downthe coast on passage This is especially the case with the BlackheadedGull and the various species of Terns These latter birds are oftenseen in spring and autumn in flocks of varying size flying north orsouth close inshore fishing as they go sometimes remaining a day hereor there where food chances to be plentiful The migrations of certainspecies of land birds that reside in littoral districts are alsopronounced and regular and easily remarked along the coast the arrivaland departure of Martins and Swallows being a specially interestingfeature But the most remarkable birds of all so far as concernsmigration are those to which our second chapter is devoted viz thePlovers and the Sandpipers Perhaps in this group more than in anyother the habit of migration is most strongly displayed The journeyssome of these birds undertake in spring and autumn can only be describedas marvellous The Sanderling breeds in the North Polar Basin and inwinter is found in the Malay Archipelago in the Cape Colony and inPatagonia the Knot has a similar distribution in summer but in wintervisits such enormously remote localities as Australia New Zealand theCape Colony and Brazil Well may these little birds excite exceptionalfeelings of interest in the observer who watches them each recurringseason running blithely over the sands and the mudflats when heremembers the distances they travelBut migration on the coast is by no means confined to the birds thathabitually reside upon it All the migratory species that dwell ininland districts must pass the coast on their annual journeys in springand autumn At these seasons in suitable districts of which we havealready indicated the most favourable for observation birds may bewatched day after day and week after week entering our area to rendersummer glad with their cheerful presence passing along our shores toyet more distant destinations or departing in autumn for warmer landsand sunnier skies Many of these birds of course enter our islandsduring the night and thus escape observation many others it may bepass to inland haunts by day but without alighting upon the coast atall flying at altitudes which render their identification or evendetection impossible but then there are many more and especially inautumn when the flight is generally far more leisurely than in springwhich crowd upon the coasts or pass along them within easy view of themost casual scrutiny It may here perhaps be advisable to allude tothe general order in which migrants usually appear upon the coast Ofcourse it is utterly impossible within the narrow limits of thepresent chapter to enter very minutely into the many and intricatephenomena connected with the migration of birds The reader anxious forfurther and more detailed information on this very interesting subjectmay be referred to the present writers works upon Migration and tothat on the birds of Heligoland by Herr Gtke[8] Now as regards theactual order of appearance In spring the observer will almostinvariably find that the adult males are in the van the females are thenext to arrive whilst the young of the preceding summer and the moreor less weakly individuals bring up the rear Many of these young andsickly birds pass the summer far south of the usual breedinggrounds sothat it is by no means an uncommon thing to find individuals of certainArcticnesting species frequenting the British coasts throughout thatseason The presence in our area of these northern birds during summerhas not unnaturally led to the supposition that they actually breedthere In autumn the order of migration is to some extent reversed Atthat season a few old birds of either sex are the first to arrivesometimes preceding and always invariably accompanying the flights ofyoung birds which are then moving south Many of these young birdsstart off from their birthplace almost as soon as their wings arestrong enough to bear them and individuals of certain Arctic specieshave been met with on our coasts with particles of the down of theirnestling plumage still adhering to their feathers The adult males comesouth next the females following and last of all come the cripples andthe weaklythe individuals that have been retarded in their flight byaccidents of various kinds such as the loss of wing feathers bydeformities or by disease The observer on the coast will also remarkconsiderable diversity in the social or gregarious tendencies of thesemigrants Some migrate gregariously in numbers that are as uncountableas the pebbles on the shore others journey in family parties in smallflocks or even singly The migration of each species is usually firstremarked by the appearance of an odd bird or two then the numbersincrease perhaps with two or more great rushes when the flight of thatparticular species becomes exceptionally marked the migration thengradually falling off almost if not quite as imperceptibly as itcommencedWe now propose briefly to sketch a few of the more salient features ofmigration on the coast during spring and autumn If the weather befavourable the spring migration of some birds commences in FebruaryThe species moving at that early date are birds that we have in theBritish Isles all the year round such as Thrushes Hedge SparrowsTitmice Wrens Finches Buntings Jays Rooks and Carrion Crows Thedifficulty in distinguishing migrating individuals of these species fromothers that are sedentary is sufficiently great to render the movementunseen except perhaps to experts or to the keepers of light vesselsoff the coast The observations of these men however prove that thesebirds actually pass from our islands to the Continent from that dateonwards These birds all migrate nearly due east The next birds toleave their winter quarters in Britain are those whose line of migrationextends northeast and amongst these we must include such familiarspecies as Blackbirds Robins Goldcrests Greenfinches ChaffinchesStarlings Hooded Crows Jackdaws Ring Doves and Lapwings For quite acouple of months these species continue to leave us for Continentalbreedinggrounds and their presence on the coast during early springis an unfailing sign of their departure Then comes the departure ofsuch birds that are found only in winter in the BritishIslandsRedwings Fieldfares Bramblings Siskins Snow Buntings and soon The departure of these birds begins in February or early March andlasts until the beginning of May About the same time also many coastbirds pass from our islands such as Golden Plovers Lapwings CurlewsRedshanks Woodcocks and Snipesthat is to say the migratoryindividuals of these species that only visit us during winter Ducks andGeese also begin to move north and many indications of their passagemay be seen by the careful observer of birds along the shore MarchApril and May the two former months especially is the period of theirdeparture At this season also many individuals of these species passalong our coast districts from more southern countries on their way tonorthern haunts These birds are known as coasting migrants The mosttypical of these coasting migrants and those that may be readilydistinguished are such species as Whimbrels Ringed PloversSanderlings Stints Skuas and Curlew Sandpipers Whimbrels are veryregular in their appearance arriving at the end of April and themigration continuing through MayEarly in March on our southern coasts the purely summer visitors beginto be seen Woodcocks and Pied Wagtails amongst others making theirappearance Towards the end of March or very early in April the firstof the purely southern species reach us Two of the most familiar arethe Wheatear and the Chiffchaff Ring Ouzels Willow Wrens and YellowWagtails follow them closely As April passes on the numbers of oursummer migrants increase Whinchats Redstarts Wrynecks CuckoosWhitethroats Blackcaps Swallows Martins and so on appearing inforce Towards the end of the month and in May Terns variousSandpipers Turtle Doves and Quails may all be found upon the coastson their spring migration Among the last to appear are such species asLesser Whitethroats Spotted Fly Catchers Garden Warblers andRedbacked Shrikes This spring migration of birds along the Britishcoasts lasts for a period of quite four monthsfrom February to the endof May or the first week in June Some birds may be observed on passagealmost throughout this period others not more than half thistimeespecially the Warblers Wagtails and Pipitsothers yet againcomplete their migration in a month or less amongst these being theRedbacked Shrike and the Greenshank For the spring migration of suchspecies that visit the British Islands to breed the southern coasts ofcourse are the best points of observationnone of these birds breedsouth of their point of entrance to our area as they all reach us fromwinter quarters in more southerly latitudes than oursThe spring migration of birds over the British Islands has scarcelyceased before the first signs of the autumn flight begin to be apparentalong the coast Of course this early autumn migration is firstnoticeable upon our northern and eastern coastlines Certainly by themiddle of July a few of the Arctic wading birds may be noticed on theshore or flying south along the coast Towards the end of the monthand early in August the number of these returning migrants increasesYoung Knots and Gray Plovers with odd adult birds appear upon thesands and mudflats Almost at the same time we may notice the CommonSandpiper back again upon the shore followed by Lapwings RingedPlovers Greenshanks and Curlews Then various small birds begin todrift along the coast on their passage southSwifts Wheatears WillowWrens and Whinchats Throughout August the migration of birds getsstronger and stronger and towards the end of the month and early inSeptember our own summer migrants begin to leave the country Warblersand Swallows Wheatears Flycatchers Thrushes Wagtails and Pipitsmay be met with from time to time along the coast all bent upon earlydeparture The wide reaches of mud and sand often so dull anduninteresting and devoid of birdlife in summer are rapidly fillingwith a new population Plovers and Sandpipers appearing upon them fromday to day in everincreasing numbers whilst the seas near by arebecoming sprinkled with the earliest hosts of Ducks and Geese TheTerns once more are on the move this time flying south to warmerseas With the advent of October most of our summer birds have gone afew belated Swallows and Wheatears a few venturesome Chiffchaffs andWagtails being all that remain All the autumn through howevercoasting migrants of many speciesthe same that passed north inspringcontinue flying south Most of this migration is from the northand northeastEarly in October however the direction of this great migrant tidefalls nearly to due east and from this time onwards the English shoresof the German Ocean say from Yorkshire to the estuary of the Thamesbecome by far the most interesting of all our coastline to the studentof Migration Normally the number of species is not very extensive butthe number of individual birds can only be described as stupendous Thevast feathery tides of migrants that break in countless waves upon oureastern coasts in autumn are composed of birds that breed incontinental Europe and Western Asia and return to the BritishIslandsthe centre of their dispersalto winter The mighty inrush ofbirds must be seen to be properly appreciated For days for weeks thewild North Sea is swept by these migrating myriads By day by nightthe feathered hosts pour in the bulk of the migrants being composed ofsuch birds as Starlings Larks Goldcrests Thrushes Finches Rooksand Crows Some idea of their numbers may be gained from the fact thatthese waves of birds often strike our coastline simultaneously northto south for hundreds of miles Waves of Goldcrests have extended fromthe Fares to the English Channel Larks for weeks have poured in insuccessive waves by day and night The Hooded Crow is another speciesthat crosses the North Sea in myriads every autumn This bird prefers tomigrate by day and appears to do the journey across in an astonishingshort time Starlings again often migrate across in a succession ofclouds which defy all attempts to estimate their numbers Thismigration of birds say on the coasts of Lincolnshire and Norfolk isone of the most fascinating sights the shore can yield To be out bydawn on the crisp October mornings and to watch the vast inrush ofbirds to the English coast for hour after hour is a treat no lover ofbirds can fail to appreciate Here and there the seabanks and the roughsaltings are strewn with birds skulking and resting amongst the grassor in the hedges that have made the passage of the North Sea during theprevious night and are soon about to pass inland Tired Woodcocks risereluctantly from the dry grass in the hedge bottoms Hooded Crows incompanies are hungrily feeding on the mudflats Goldcrests perhapsare swarming on the thornbushes Overhead Sky Larks are arriving incountless numbers from over the sea often breaking out into gladsomesong as soon as the welcome land is reached whilst Rooks Ring DovesJackdaws and Finches of various species arrive from time to time Thisstate of things continues through October and well into November thesteady influx of birds from time to time culminating in an overwhelmingrush It should also be remarked that in some years birds are morenumerous than others and the duration of the migration of anyparticular species varies a good deal sometimes lasting but a fewweeks sometimes as many months The autumn migration of birds lasts forabout five months beginning in July and continuing to November Of thetwo seasons of passage perhaps the autumn movement will prove the mostinteresting to the ordinary observer of birdlife on the coast Birdsare much more numerous in autumn and travel slower The movements ofbirds during winter along the coast are also intensely interesting butthis scarcely comes within the scope of the present chapterWe cannot well conclude this brief account of Bird Migration on thecoast without some allusion to those perils which beset the birds ontheir journeys and which arise principally from lighthouses andlightvessels Vast numbers of birds kill themselves every spring andautumn by striking against these gleaming beacons of the coast Fromthis great mortality however naturalists have learnt much concerningthe annual movements of birds for the records kept by our light menextending as they do over a number of years of these fatalities andperiodical visits of migrants are most instructive and suggestive Someof the scenes witnessed at these lighthouses and vessels during theseasons of migrationespecially in autumnare intensely interestingThese beacons are most fatal during cloudy weather few birds strike onclear and cloudless nights Odd birds are continually striking againstthe lanterns Now and then however there come nights when birds swarmlike bees round the lamps and kill themselves in thousands by strikingagainst the glass sometimes with such force as to shatter it tofragments The illustration at the head of the present chapter alsoshows another peril of migration Many nets are placed on the shores ofthe Wash and great numbers of birds are or used to be caught duringthe autumn months Information however has recently reached me thatthe birds are learning by many years experience to avoid thesesnares flying over instead of through them and that nothing like thenumbers are caught nowadays Fifteen years ago thousands of birds musthave been taken in these netsAnother peril of migration is the danger of losing the way Many youngand inexperienced birds go astray each autumn and the British listcontains the names of numbers of rare species that have visited us onabnormal flights Many of these birds have been captured on the coastFrom Eastern Europe from Siberia from Africa and even from Americathese wanderers have come Each period of migration the observer onthe coast may be agreeably surprised to meet with one of these lost andwandering individuals and it is this glorious uncertainty that addsconsiderably to the pleasure of a ramble along the shore in spring andautumn
