tell you the story of the war as itunfolded itself during the year 1915 It was a year of lifeanddeathstruggle during which two other nations were swept by the seethingwhirlpool into the waters of strife and eight out of ten persons in thecontinent of Europe were living under war conditions It was a yearduring which the three greatest empires of the world and seven otherPowers fought fierce and bitter combats on five different battle frontsin Europe alone It was a year in which some millions of men fell on thestricken field and yet the issue of the vast and terrible struggleremained undecidedIt was a year in which the Allies who were quite unready when war wasforced upon them strained every nerve to set their military houses inorder to enlist and train for the field their reserves of manhood andto furnish themselves with those weapons and munitions in which theywere deficient It was a year in which millions of hardearned moneywere spent every day and the combatants piled up mountains of debt forfuture generations to pay offIt was a year during which the Allies had good cause to thank God forthe long years of peaceful industry which had given Britain greatriches and for the splendid navy which maintained for her the freedomof the seas Britains vast reserves of wealth enabled her to raiseplentiful money for carrying on the war and thanks to her navy hermerchant ships were able to carry the products of her mines mills andfactories to other lands Great Britain alone of all the combatants wasthus able to produce wealth in time of war and to assist hersorelyhampered friends with timely loans[Illustration The Modern Pied PiperFrom the picture by A C Michael By permission of The IllustratedLondon NewsYou remember Brownings poem about the Pied Piper who drew the childrenafter him by the magic of his music This picture shows the pipers of aHighland regiment drawing men after them to the recruiting offices Irejoice in my Empires effort said the King and I feel pride in thevoluntary response of my subjects all over the world    The end isnot in sight More men and yet more are wanted to keep my armies in thefield and through them to secure Victory and enduring Peace]During 1915 the British nation for the first time began to organizeitself for warfare on a vast scale It found itself forced to raise anarmy thirty times as great as it had ever marshalled before and toequip millions of men with every weapon known to the science of warMoreover it had to do this while the small forces which it had alreadyplaced in the field were struggling to maintain themselves againstterrible odds It was a work that called for every ounce of energy anddetermination that the Empire possessed and it could never have beendone at all had not the British people as a whole given willingsupport to their leadersThe year was not many months old when it became evident that we couldnot hope to hold the enemy in check and drive him from his stronglyfortified trenches unless we had an almost unlimited supply of big gunsand high explosive shells Early in the struggle the French had settheir gun and ammunition factories working at high pressure and theyhad taken good care that they should be fully manned with skilledworkmen Britain on the other hand had far too small a number offactories for manufacturing the vast supplies of war material which sheneeded and many of her skilled workmen had been allowed to enlist andproceed to the frontCommittees were formed to organize all the workshops in the countrycapable of making weapons and ammunition and vast supplies of machinetools guns and shells were ordered from the United States and CanadaWhile this was being done a strong feeling gained ground that thegovernment of the country should no longer be in the hands of aparticular political party but should be composed of the best men ofall parties in the State In May a National Government was set up and aminister was appointed to devote himself wholly and entirely to thebusiness of speeding up the production of munitions by every possiblemeans in his power Mr LloydGeorge filled this post and forthwithflung himself with great zeal and energy into the work His first dutywas to convince the nation of the great and crying need for moremunitions He pleaded with workmen to realize the danger and to allythemselves with brothers in the trenches by working early and late andat the very top of their energy Great posters appeared all over thecountry showing a soldier and a workman clasping hands Behind the onewas a battery of big guns and behind the other the smoking chimneys ofa munition factory Above was the legend Were both needed to servethe guns and beneath the cry Fill up the ranks Pile up themunitionsUnhappily even in this time of great national danger there were labourtroubles Masters and men quarrelled about rates of wages and hours ofwork while their sons and brothers were dying at the front for lack ofshells with which to keep down the fierce bombardment of the enemy Notuntil laws were passed preventing masters from making undue profits outof the nations needs and punishing workmen who kept bad time was thestrife allayed The Trade Unions were persuaded to relax their rulesand gradually most of the difficulties were removed Slowly but steadilythe supply of arms and ammunition increased until in the latter part ofthe year the shortage was overtaken and it was possible to meet theenemy on more than equal terms A wellknown public man who visited thetrenches in November was able to say For every shell which the Germansthrow today we are throwing five Mr LloydGeorges complimentssaid a British gunner to the shell as he closed the breech of his gunand theres plenty more where that came fromBritain had not only to supply the needs of her own army and navy butto help her Allies as well Before the year was half over the Russiansupply of rifles and shells almost gave out Russia as you know is farmore an agricultural than an industrial country She has no great numberof machine shops that can be turned into munition factories nor has sheanything like the number of skilled workmen required to furnish her withthe enormous supplies of war material which she needs In May when theGermans brought against her a tremendous force of artillery and machineguns her shortage was so great that she could not resist and wasobliged to make a long retreat from Poland and Galicia Many of herrecruits had no rifles at all and at one time the artillery of herSecond Army could only reply to the incessant fire of the enemy with twoshells a dayThe Russians strove manfully to increase their supply of munitions andGreat Britain and Japan gave them much help By November they hadincreased their supplies to such an extent that they were able not onlyto resist the enemy but to attack him Some idea of the spirit shown bythe Russian munition workers may be obtained from the following messagewhich was found written on an ammunition box Do not spare the shellsthere are plenty more coming comrades We are working hard to keep yousupplied Cheer upPoor little Serbia had all along to struggle against a great lack of warsupplies Her factories were never able to give her more than a tithe ofher needs You will remember that but for the ammunition which theAllies sent to her in December 1914 she could not have driven theAustrians from her country In December 1915 when the Serbian army wasdriven into Albania[1] it became entirely dependent for food andsupplies upon Britain France and ItalyGreat Britain had not only to produce weapons and other munitions forherself and her friends but she had to enlist and train more and moremen to fill up her ranks and to repair the wastage of war While everyother nation engaged in the struggle could force men to serve in thearmy she alone used no compulsion but left each man to decide forhimself whether he would take up arms or remain in civil life Greatefforts were made to persuade sound men of military age to join thearmy Every blank wall was covered with posters calling upon men toserve their king and country and recruiting meetings were as the sandsof the sea for number But though the response was wonderful it wasfelt that some better method of securing men was needed Many peoplethought that all suitable men should be compelled to serve but theGovernment was reluctant to change the system which had served thecountrys needs so well in former times[Illustration The Minister of Munitions introducing the Munitions Billin the House of Commons June 23 1915From the drawing by S BeggThree millions of young men have offered their services for theircountry it depends upon us at home to support them with skillstrength and every resource of machinery and organization at ourdisposal so as to drive the conviction into the heart of nations forall time to come that those governments who deceive their neighbours totheir ruin do so at their peril]At the end of June a law was passed which enabled the Government todiscover exactly what resources of men and women the country containedAll persons male and female between the ages of fifteen and sixtyfivewere required to fill up a form stating their names and ages the numberof those who were dependent on them whether or no they were marriedand what was the nature of their occupation Early in October LordDerby who had shown great energy in raising recruits in Lancashire wasappointed Director of Recruiting for the whole country and speedily heput forward a new plan for bringing in men The registration forms weresorted out those men who were engaged in Government work werestarredthat is they were not to be considered as available for thearmyand the names of all other men between the ages of nineteen andfortyone were placed on cards which were handed over to jointcommittees of the political parties in order that a great nationalcanvass might be conductedThe canvassers used all their powers of persuasion to get men ofmilitary age and sound health to enlist in one or other of fortysixgroups which were arranged according to the ages of the men andwhether they were married or unmarried Men were permitted to enlist intheir respective groups and remain in civil life until their ownparticular group was called up Courts were set up before whichenlisted men could appear and ask to be starred or transferred to somelater class Only those persons without whose services the business ofthe country could not be properly carried on could claim to bestarred While the canvass was in progress the Government gave noticethat unmarried men would be called up before married men and that ifthe unmarried men did not come forward in sufficient numbers they wouldbe compelled to do so The canvass was successfulit resulted in theenrolment of very many recruits but whether compulsion could be stavedoff by this system remained to be seen Late in November it was saidthat Britain would have four million men in arms by the following MarchMoney as you know is the sinews of war Without money and a greatdeal of it armies and navies cannot be arrayed or kept in the fieldThe British Empire according to the statement of the Prime Ministerhas a yearly income of 4000000000 This sum is vast but so was thecost of the war In March we were spending five millions of money a dayIf you work out a little sum you will see that one year of war at thisrate uses up not far short of half the total money earned in a year bythe whole British Empire Of course in war time the Empire cannotproduce as much wealth as it can in times of peace Large numbers of menare taken away from their work and instead of being producers theyhave to be kept and fed by the nation Thousands of factories areengaged in making war material for the Government and they do nottherefore add to the national wealth at all Our overseas trade fallsoff greatly because we need many of our merchant ships for transportand supply because we cannot produce such large quantities of goods forexport and because we cannot trade with enemy countries at allIn time of peace the goods which we get from other countries are paidfor by the goods which we send to them by the money which we receivefrom foreigners for carrying goods to all parts of the world and by theinterest which comes to us from money which we have invested abroadUsually these three items not only pay for our imports but give us alarge profit as well In time of war however we are in quite adifferent positionAt all times we must import much material from abroad We are alwaysobliged to import the greater part of our food and the raw materials forour factories During the present war we have also been obliged toimport large quantities of machinery and munitions from the UnitedStates Our imports of goods always exceed our exports of goods invalue but in time of war the imports soar up to a great height whilethe exports sink For example the excess of imports over exports duringthe first nine months of 1914 was 99 millions while for the same periodof 1915 it was 256 millionsThus you see that while the war lasts our exports the profits on ourshipping trade and the interest which we receive from foreigninvestments are not sufficient to pay for our imports In order to makeup the balance we must either draw on our national savings or run intodebt If we draw on our savings we shall have so much the less moneyleft for the expenses of the war If we run largely into debt we shallfind ourselves heavily burdened when the day of peace arrivesBy the end of May the Government was seriously considering theallimportant question of money and before long was urging on thepeople the necessity of being as thrifty as possible and of savingevery penny that they possibly could Speakers went to and fro pointingout that householders must avoid waste and stint themselves of foreigngoods if the nation was to have sufficient money with which to carry ona long war Those who saved money and gave up the use of such things ashad to be imported from abroad were doing a patriotic service and werecasting the silver bullets with which the war was to be won In manythousands of homes these wise words were taken to heart but on theother hand many people who were earning high wages showed but littledesire to save Something was also done to lessen the enormous sumswasted on strong drink in this country every year by restricting thehours during which publichouses might be kept open and by confiningthe sale of spirits to certain fixed times The King set a splendidexample which was largely followed by banishing strong drink from histable altogetherProbably you think that all this talk about exports and imports and thenecessity for saving is very dull and you are eager to hear ofstirring deeds by land and sea We shall come to them in good time butI must claim a little more of your patience before I begin the story ofthe years fighting Always remember that when the money which a nationpossesses or can borrow gives out it must cease to fight and mustmake peace with its foes That nation wins which has money to continuethe struggle when the resources of its opponents are exhaustedHow do we obtain money with which to carry on the war There is only oneplace where it can come from and that is from the pockets of theBritish people In time of peace the money for carrying on thegovernment is raised by various kinds of taxes People with incomesabove a certain sum per year have to pay to the Government so much moneyfor every pound which they earn or receive from investments Those whohave a lesser income do not pay what is called income tax but you mustnot suppose that they go scot free Spirits beer tea coffee tobaccosugar cocoa dried fruits and other things have to pay a dutythatis a certain sum is added to their price and this sum goes to theGovernmentIn time of war when the expenses of the Government are much greaterthan they are in time of peace the old taxes are raised and new taxesare imposed In September 1915 for example the taxes were raised some40 per cent Money is also raised from the savings of the people Theyare asked to lend money to the State at a certain rate of interest withthe promise that the sum which they lend shall be paid back again infull at the end of a certain period Of course this interest has alsoto be provided by the taxpayers Three hundred and fifty million poundswere borrowed in November 1914 but by June 1915 it was found necessaryto borrow more money and a loan of nearly six hundred millionsfarand away beyond any amount ever subscribed in the worlds historywasplaced at the disposal of the Government One feature of this loan wasthe attempt to get persons of small means to participate in it Vouchersfor 5s 10s and 1 were issued and working men and even schoolchildren were encouraged to buy them Unfortunately only about fivemillions were raised in this way and later in the year otherarrangements were made in the hope of bringing in more money from thesavings of the working classes In September the people of the UnitedStates lent the British and French Governments one hundred millions andthis money was used to pay for some of the munitions and other thingswhich we were buying from America                           War brought about many changes in our national life We became a sobererpeople and we refrained largely from those sports which are so dear tous in time of peace Expensive entertainments were frowned uponholidays were shortened or given up altogether and many men beyond themilitary age spent their annual weeks of leisure in munition or farmwork Special constables were enrolled to take the place of the policewho had joined the colours and volunteer corps sprang up everywhere[Illustration Womens Volunteer Reserve on a Route March in LondonPhoto Alfieri]From the moment the war began British women played a noble part Notonly did thousands of them qualify as nurses and offer their servicesin the hospitals at home and abroad but many of them became munitionworkers ticket collectors tram conductors motorcar drivers farmservants and letter carriers In every town and village there were workparties busily engaged in making socks mufflers mittens etc for themen in the trenches or for the wounded in the hospitals The neglectedart of knitting wonderfully revived and women were seen plying theneedles everywhere in trams and trains or at lectures and concertsWhen the Germans first used poison gas against our troops and the WarOffice asked for half a million respirators wagonloads of them arrivedthe next day Girls schools womens societies groups of friends andfamilies buckled to and in a remarkably short time the War Office wasable to announce that no more respirators were neededThousands of charitable societies made appeals for almost every warpurpose imaginable There were flag days in every town and singersactors and lecturers gave their services in every good cause TheBritish Red Cross Society received the most generous support while themany Belgian refugees in Britain were carefully tended and whereverpossible provided with work Money was freely given by the public inevery part of the Empire to set up hospitals and send nurses doctorsand ambulances to France Belgium Russia and Serbia and even woundedhorses were not neglected One notable gift announced towards the end ofNovember was the sum of 10000 sent by the Canadian Government toassist in the upkeep of the AngloRussian hospital In Great Britainmany country houses were offered as hospitals and convalescent homesand on the great sporting estates game was shot for the sick andwounded Children gathered apples for the men of the Fleet worked inthe fields for shorthanded farmers and collected eggs and sphagnummoss[2] for the hospitals There was no lack of ready and willinghelpers for every good causeAt this time of stress and anxiety the British nation learned the nobleart of giving There was scarcely a British household in the world whichdid not practise some selfdenial in order to be able to send smallluxuries and comforts to the men at the front or muchneeded help tothe prisoners in Germany Remote cottages in the Highlands of Scotlandlonely farms in the NorthWest of Canada outlying homesteads inAustralia New Zealand and South Africa were thus linked together bythe same generous impulse[Illustration Queen Elizabeth of Belgium visiting a HospitalPhoto Newspaper Illustrations LtdQueen Elizabeth is patron of the Belgian Field Hospital to which thereaders and friends of The Childrens Story of the War have presenteda motor ambulance]While I am speaking of the noble way in which our people far from thedin of strife ministered to the gallant men who were fighting theirbattles I must not neglect the small but very useful effort made by thereaders of these pages and their friends While our third volume was inthe course of serial issue it was suggested that our readers shouldcombine in some practical work of war charity Then came the questionsWhom shall we help and How shall we helpIt was well known that the story of how poor little Belgium had been setupon by the great bully Germany and how her gallant sons had foughtand suffered and died for us had strongly moved the hearts of childrenFor this reason it was decided that the Belgian soldiers who were stillstruggling bravely in the last bit of their native land that was leftto them should be assisted They were terribly poor and they had nomoney with which to set up hospitals and buy ambulances for theirwounded A number of devoted British doctors and nurses had establisheda hospital for the Belgian soldiers who had been stricken down inbattle Their hospitalthe Belgian Field Hospitalwas the only one ona proper footing which was caring for the wounded soldiers of our noblelittle ally What better and finer work could we do than set aboutcollecting money to provide this hospital with a motor ambulanceAs soon as the object of our effort was decided upon a letter waswritten to her Majesty the Queen asking her to permit the motorambulance to be named after Prince George to whom these pages arededicated The Queen who nobly devotes herself to every good work wasgraciously pleased to express her warm interest in our effort and topermit us to inscribe Prince Georges name on the ambulance Then anappeal was printed and inserted in successive parts of The ChildrensStory of the War[Illustration The Prince George Motor AmbulanceOur readers will be gratified to see this photograph of the ambulancewhich they and their friends have presented to the Belgian FieldHospital It is a 159 Whitlock Motor Ambulance Express speciallyconstructed for field service and can be adapted either to carry fourstretcher cases or two stretcher cases and four sitting cases or maybe used as an omnibus for eight persons Its cost complete with fourstretchers is 418]The appeal was issued on 4th September and on 6th September money beganto flow in Our first contribution came from Prince George Collectingpapers were returned from every part of the United Kingdom and Canadaand even from Ferrol in Spain and from the West Indies Most of themoney consisted of the pence and halfpence of the children themselvesAn infant school in a very poor part of London sent 298 farthings as itscontribution while a school of poor little blind children sent a sumwhich represented much selfdenial Dayschool and Sundayschoolcollections were taken up one generous vicar gave a church offertory inaid of the fund lectures were delivered to help it and on no singleday for many weeks did the tide of money cease to flow Many of ourcollectors wrote letters expressing their pleasure at being able tohelp and sending us best wishes for the success of the scheme When itis stated that 450 were raised by more than 11000 subscribers it willbe seen how small the individual contributions must have beenTowards the end of November sufficient money was in hand to warrant usin offering an ambulance to the Committee of the Belgian FieldHospital The following reply was received    I am directed by Lord Sydenham and the Committee of the    Belgian Field Hospital to thank you most cordially for your    splendid efforts which have met with so much success in    raising funds to provide this hospital with a motor ambulance    We most gratefully accept the gift[Illustration The Prince George Motor Ambulance Interior arrangedfor four Stretcher Cases]Lord Sydenham the president of the hospital also wrote a specialletter of thanks in which he said It is splendid of the readers ofThe Childrens Story of the War to have subscribed so large a sumOur warmest thanks are due to all who have in any way helped to make thescheme a success We know that we shall have the unspoken gratitude ofmany wounded Belgians but we did not set about this work in order towin gratitude We wanted to be a real help to those who have helped usWe know in our hearts that we have done a little act of mercy andkindness and that is a reward which we are all entitled to enjoy[Footnote 1 Wild and mountainous country of the Balkans to the west ofSerbia with its coast on the Adriatic Sea][Footnote 2 Sphagnum or bog moss occurs in large patches of a palegreen or reddish colour on moors and sometimes fills up small lakes orpools The growth of bog moss has played a large part in the formationof peat There are many varieties of bog moss and some of them have nowbeen put to practical use in our field hospitalsThe story of the discovery of the properties of the moss is interestingOne day in a peat moss litter works some distance from Kiel a worker metwith a serious injury There were no appliances to deal with the case atthe works but the men did the best they could They took a quantity ofthe article which they manufactured peat moss litter and laying it onthe wounds tied bandages over it The injured man was then conveyed toKiel and taken to a hospital When the doctors undid the bandages andfound the dirtylooking moss litter in the wound they were horrifiedand declared that the injured limb would have to be cut off Very soonhowever their horror gave way to surprise and they said Ah here issomething which we do not know about They found that far from thepoisoning which they had expected the injury had been beautifullycleaned by the rude dressing and had actually begun to heal WithGerman thoroughness they made further experiments and so discoveredsphagnum moss from the surgeons point of view]  CHAPTER II  THE LOSS OF THE FORMIDABLEThe new year opened with a naval disaster On 31st December eightvessels of the Channel Fleet left Sheerness for a cruise in the EnglishChannel and by three oclock on the morning of 1st January werecrossing the fishingground not far from the Start Lighthouse The shipswere steaming at a moderate speed and in a single line the rearmostship being the Formidable a preDreadnought of 15000 tons and asister ship to the Bulwark which had been mysteriously blown up atSheerness in the preceding November The sea was rough the moon wasshining brightly and a cold piercing wind was blowingSoon after three oclock the dull roar of an explosion was heard on thestarboard side of the Formidable and was followed shortly afterwardsby another The ship shook from stem to stern and a cloud of blacksmoke and coal dust arose She had been struck fore and aft by twotorpedoes discharged by a German submarine At once she began to listheavily to starboard there were gaping holes in her side and it wasevident that she could not remain afloat very longThere was not the slightest sign of panic on board the doomed shipCaptain Loxley one of the ablest of our younger sailors was on thebridge setting an example to his crew of cool courage and utterforgetfulness of self The watertight doors were closed the men werepiped to quarters and telephone bells were set ringing all over theship to give warning of danger Captain Loxley might easily have calledupon his consorts to come to his rescue but he knew that the submarinewhich had discharged the fatal torpedoes was still lurking hard by sohe signalled to his sister ships Stand off submarines aboutA bugle rang out and the men below sprang from their hammocks andrushed upon deck some of them only half clad They fell into rank onthe sloping deck and Captain Loxley gave his orders as calmly as thoughhis ship were riding at anchor in harbour He was smoking a cigaretteand his favourite old terrier Bruce was standing by his side He washeard to say Steady men its all right No panic keep cool beBritish Everything of wood that might help the men in the water wasflung overboard and finally the captain gave the order Every man forhimself A survivor saw him standing with folded arms as the ship wentdown[Illustration Captain Loxley giving his Last Order as the Formidablewent downFrom the picture by C M Padday By permission of The IllustratedLondon News]As the Formidable was listing badly to starboard it was not possibleto launch boats on the port side Owing to the rough sea a cutter wasstove in but the men stuffed their jumpers into the hole and bailedout the water with their boots A barge fell perpendicularly from thedavits and threw the crew into the sea Meanwhile the stokers haddrawn all the fires and had shut off steam so that when the ship wentdown there was no boiler explosion By this time it was clear that allcould not be saved Many of the crew knew that their last hour had comeOne of the survivors thus described the scene on the decks as theFormidable sank into the waves    On one part of the ship where the men could see there was no    hope all eyes were turned upward to the flagstaff and then the    Old Jack was saluted for the last time The last impression of    the scene left on my mind was a long line of saluting figures    disappearing below the skyline At least half of the men got    clear of the ship but many must have been lost while waiting    for rescue It was almost dark at the time and the water was    icy cold                           Let me tell you how a bluejacket nobly gave his life for another as theship was sinking You shall hear the story in the words of the man whoowed his life to his comrades splendid generosity When everything hadbeen done to save the Formidable the boats came alongside and tookoff as many as possible There were five boats and two were swampedAll the boats had left the ship when the crew of one cried Room forone more Two of us tossed for it and the other chap won but he saidYou have got parents I havent Go onjump for it I did so I hadto swim for it but I was savedThe men in the leaking cutter after being tossed and buffeted by thesea drenched to the skin by the waves and numbed by the bitter windwere picked up by the Brixham fishing smack Providence about fifteenmiles from Berry Head The Providence which was owned and skipperedby William Pillar was running before the gale to Brixham for shelterbut off the Start found herself obliged to heave to owing to the forceof the wind Just then one of the crew noticed a cutter tossing underthe lee An oar had been hoisted and from it a sailors scarf wasflying as a signal of distressThe cutter was drifting towards the smack and every now and then waslost to sight amidst the heaving waves Four times did the gallantsmacksmen try to get a rope to the boat while the skipper at the helmmanoeuvred his little vessel with great skill At last a small warp wasthrown from the smack and was caught by the men on board the cutter Bymeans of the capstan the rope was hauled in and the cutter was broughtup on the lee The rescued sailors jumped on board but even in the actof doing so they were in great peril for the seas at times were risingthirty feet above the deck of the smack The work of rescue occupiedhalf an hour Seventyone men including two officers were thus savedAll were on board the smack by one oclock and a course was shaped forBrixham Before long the Providence fell in with a tug which took herin tow and brought her safely to harbour The residents of Brixham gaveblankets coats and boots to the survivors and provided them withcomfortable quarters Many of the men were utterly exhausted For hoursthey had been battling with the heavy winter seas which had almostcontinuously washed over them and they had hoped against hope until thebrown sails of the Providence had providentially come in sightOne of the Formidables boats came unaided to the shore After tossingabout for twentytwo hours in a raging sea it drifted with the tideinto Lyme Regis with forty men on board Nine of her crew had died ofexposure and had been buried at sea A light cruiser also picked upsome of the Formidables men but when the final reckoning was madeonly 201 had been saved out of a ships company of wellnigh 800 souls                           The splendid seamanship of Skipper Pillar and the great courage anddevotion of his crew greatly impressed the country On 8th February heand his men attended at Buckingham Palace where the King pinned thesilver medal for gallantry on their breasts and handed them the moneyrewards which had been bestowed upon them by the Admiralty The Kingaddressed them in the following words    I congratulate you most heartily on your gallant and heroic    conduct It is indeed a great feat to have saved seventyone    lives I realize how difficult your task must have been because    I know myself how arduous it is to gybe[3] a vessel in a heavy    galeAmongst the crew of the Providence was Daniel Taylor an apprenticeIn reply to the King he said that he had been at sea for just overtwelve months and that he was seventeen years of age The Kingobserved You are small for your age but you have taken part in a verygallant deed and I congratulate you Some time later Skipper Pillarwas given a commission in the Royal Navy                           I must not close this account of the disaster without dwelling for amoment upon the manner in which Captain Loxley went down with his shipThe history of the British navy is full of stories of cool calm courageand selfless devotion in the face of death and it is good to know thatthe sailors of our Navy are as true as ever to the spirit of those whobuilt up its glorious fame in years gone by On the very verge of doomwhen mens courage is apt to fail them Captain Loxley showed no sign offlinching In his last moments he thought only of others He strovemanfully to save as many of his crew as possible and he refused toendanger the lives of his comrades in the sister ships by calling themto his aid He went to his death like the gallant gentleman that he wasand his last appeal not only to his crew but to you and me was BeBritishHow kind and thoughtful he was to others is seen from the followingletter which he wrote to his old nurse just before leavingSheerness      HMS Formidable    My dear old Nan NanIm afraid that my Christmas present will    be a bit late I meant to have sent it off yesterday but    forgot Anyhow I hope it will arrive safely My very best love    and best wishes to you and William for Christmas and the New    Year and may we soon beat the Germans    We are having really quite a quiet time but you never know    when anything may happen I was out at Malta when war began but    soon came home Had three days leave and then came to this    ship where I am likely to remain for the present    Peter [his son] has gone to school and is just home for his    first holiday which I expect he is enjoying just as much as I    did but he was much braver going to school than I was Every    one seems well at Gloucester but I have only seen mother once    for about ten minutes during the last two years With much    love yours lovingly Noel LoxleyOne word more before I pass from this tragic story The loss of theFormidable clearly showed that the lessons taught by the sinking ofthe Cressy Hogue and Aboukir had not been learned Our Navy hadnot yet fully appreciated the fact that the only way to avoid the perilof the enemy submarines is for battleships to steam at high speedfrequently changing their course and always accompanied by a flotillaof guardian destroyers The eight ships that sailed down the Channel onthe first day of the year 1915 steamed slowly in the bright light of themoon They were thus a good target for the enemys submarines and wereindeed courting disaster As the year went by the Navy learned itslesson and learned it well Before many months had passed our sailorswere more than a match for the underwater boats of the enemy and thetime was soon to arrive when the German submarines were fearlesslyhunted and constantly trapped[Footnote 3 To change from one tack to the other without going aboutto shift a foreandaft sail from one side to the other when the wind isaft or on the quarter]  CHAPTER III  THE BATTLE OF THE DOGGER BANKUp to the 24th of January 1915 squadrons of the German High Sea Fleethad adventured four times into the North Sea The first occasion was on28th August 1914 when the Battle of Heligoland Bight was fought andthe enemy lost three cruisers and two destroyers On 17th October asquadron of German destroyers was encountered off the Dutch coast by asimilar British squadron and before long four of the enemy ships weresent to the bottom of the sea Twice afterwards the enemy greatlydaring left his fortified harbours and minefields but on suchoccasions his object was not to fight but to dodge the British fleetand inflict frightfulness on more or less undefended coast towns On3rd November he shelled Yarmouth beach but was very uneasy during hisineffective attack and scuttled homewards immediately he was warnedthat a British fleet was after him Even on this occasion he did notescape without loss the cruiser Yorck ran on a German mine and wassunk This raid was followed by the attack on Scarborough Whitby andthe Hartlepools which I described at length in Chapter XXXV of ourthird volumeElated by their success in killing the defenceless townsfolk ofunprotected towns the Germans now prepared for another dash across theNorth Sea We do not know exactly what their object was Some tell usthat an attack was to be made on the Tyne or the Forth others say thatthe enemy hoped to get one or more of his battle cruisers round thenorth of Scotland so that they might prey on British commerce Whateverthe object may have been RearAdmiral Hipper who was in command of theBattle Cruiser Squadron detailed for the work knew that he wouldprobably have to meet a British fleet If so he intended to run forhome without delay and to lure the British ships into a trap Heenlarged the minefield north of Heligoland and gathered there a largeforce of submarines He fondly believed that he could entice ourvessels into this dangerous area where his submarines together withthe seaplanes and Zeppelins which were in readiness on the island wouldmake short work of them Such was his plan We are now to see how itfailedThe night of Saturday the 23rd was foggy and our destroyers scoutingeast of the Dogger Bank tossed all night on the waves scarcely able topierce the gloom for a hundred yards around them Sunday morninghowever dawned sharp and clear the wind had changed to the northeastand had swept the mists from the seas About seven in the morning thelight cruiser Aurora sighted the German squadron off the Dogger Atonce she signalled the news to Admiral Beatty and opened fire                           The German squadron which the Aurora had sighted consisted of theSeydlitz which flew the flag of RearAdmiral Hipper the Moltkethe Derfflinger the Bluecher together with six light cruisers anda flotilla of destroyers The first three of the vessels named had aspeed of nearly 27 knots and were armed with either 12inch or 11inchguns The Bluecher was an older and much slower vessel she couldsteam 24 knots and her main armament consisted of 82inch guns It wasclear that in a chase she would have to be left behind and thus wouldfall a prey to the enemyTo meet this force Admiral Beatty had under his command the greatbattle cruisers Lion Tiger Princess Royal and New Zealandtogether with the Indomitable four cruisers of the town classtheSouthampton the Nottingham the Birmingham and the Lowestoftthree light cruisersthe Arethusa the Aurora and the Undauntedas well as two destroyer flotillas His squadron was superior to that ofthe Germans in numbers speed and weight of fire                           The Dogger Bank off which the Germans were sighted is a great shoalalmost midway between England and Denmark and extending to within fortymiles of the Yorkshire coast Its length from north to south is about160 miles its breadth is 70 miles and the average depth of water overit varies from ten to twenty fathoms[4] South of the Dogger is a secondand smaller shoal known as the Well Bank Still further south aredeeps such as the Silver Pit where the depth is as much asfortyfive fathomsThe Dogger is the chief fishing ground of the North Sea During thewinter the waters above it are alive with trawlers all engaged inreaping the rich harvest of the waters Immense quantities of halibutsoles turbot brill plaice cod haddock and whiting are takenpacked in boxesto be carried off by fishcutters to the ports orstored in ice until the trawler is ready to return home Somewhere nearthe Dogger probably on its northeastern edge the Germans wereencountered The naval battle which followed was not the first to befought near the great shoal In 1781 an English and a Dutch fleet met inthese waters and struggled fiercely but the action was undecided andthe Dutch claimed a victory                           When the Aurora opened fire Admiral Beattys squadron which was notfar away steered in the direction of the gun flashes Immediately theGerman scouting cruisers perceived that a British squadron was afterthem they turned tail and fled to the southeast Hipper did not wait todiscover the strength of his opponents but took to his heels at onceThis seems to show that his real object was to lure the British shipsinto the position which he had prepared for them and there engage themon his own terms There were 120 miles of open sea to be crossed beforethe minefields were reachedWhen the signal was made Seven enemy shipsfour battle cruisers andthree cruisers with destroyersto the southwest there was fierceglee on board the British ships Every man was agog for the fight allwere eager to avenge the women and children who had been murdered sobrutally at Scarborough and the Hartlepools Every gun was manned withmen who had vengeance in their hearts and down below the black squadwere striving with all their might to get every knot possible out oftheir engines A commander was heard to remark One would think thiswas a game of football the boys are enjoying it so much The Lionand Tiger were soon racing ahead at thirty knots an hour and wereleaving the less speedy Princess Royal and New Zealand behind Ateight oclock the situation was as follows the Germans were movingsoutheast in line with the Moltke leading followed by theSeydlitz and the Derfflinger the Bluecher bringing up the rearTheir destroyers were on the starboard beam and their light cruisersahead Close upon them were the British destroyers and the lightcruisers which now crossed to the port side in order that their smokemight not hide the big German ships from the British gunners TheLion Tiger Princess Royal New Zealand and Indomitable didnot follow directly behind the German ships lest the enemy should throwout mines but held on a parallel course to the westwardBy nine oclock the Lion was within 11 miles of the Bluecher Shefired a shot which fell short but when the squadrons were ten milesapart she got her first blow home Do you realize what this means Atten miles the Bluecher appeared no bigger than a pin point and shewas moving at the rate of thirty miles an hour across the sea You willagree that the British gunnery must have been superb for hits to be madeunder these conditionsSoon the Lion overhauled the slow Bluecher and in passing gave hera broadside which caused frightful damage The Lions quarry howeverwas further ahead and as she began to engage the Derfflinger theTiger began to hit out at the Bluecher She also passed by and thePrincess Royal the New Zealand and the Indomitable in turnturned their guns on the rearmost ship of the German line while theleading British ships were engaging the foremost ships of the enemy Athalfpast nine the situation was as shown in the diagram on the nextpageAs early as a quarter to ten the Bluecher began to show signs of theheavy punishment inflicted on her It was now evident that she wasdoomed She had been abandoned by her speedier consorts and her end wasonly a matter of time By eleven oclock the Seydlitz and theDerfflinger were on fire the Bluecher had fallen behind and wasbeing mercilessly pounded by the IndomitableMeanwhile the German destroyers had attempted an attack but had beendriven off by the British destroyers Shortly afterwards the Germandestroyers got between the Lion and the Tiger and the leading enemyships and began to raise huge volumes of smoke so as to screen thetargets from the British gunners Under cover of this smoke the Germanschanged course and made a halfturn to the north Again the enemydestroyers attacked at close quarters hoping to torpedo the Lion andthe Tiger They were however driven off by the 4inch guns of ourbattle cruisers[Illustration The Sinking of the German Dreadnought Bluecher duringthe Battle of the Dogger Bank fought on January 24 1915]And now while the chase continues we must return to the Bluecherwhich had made a gallant fight but was nearing her end Ship after shiphad turned its guns upon her with terrible effect her upper works hadbeen smashed to atoms and practically every gun which she possessed hadbeen put out of action Shot and shell had rained upon her and she wasburning furiously[Illustration Battle of January 24 1915930 am]    We were under fire first in the action and last said a German    survivor Almost every British ship flung shot and shell at us    It was awful I have never seen such gunnery and hope that as    long as I live I never shall We could not fight such guns as    the British ships had and soon we had no guns with which to    fight anything Our decks were swept by shot and the guns were    smashed and lying in all directions their crews wiped out One    terrible shell from a big gun I shall never forget It burst    right in the heart of the ship and killed scores of men It    fell where many men had collected and killed practically every    one of them We all had our floating equipment and we soon    needed it One shell killed five men quite close to me and it    was only a matter of time when nothing living would be left upon    the ship if she continued to float When we knew that we were    beaten and that our flag was not to come down many of us were    praying that the ship would sink in order that no more men    would be killed We would rather trust to the British picking us    up after our ship had sunk than to their missing us with those    terrible guns so long as she kept afloatAbout noon a British destroyer the Meteor torpedoed the Bluecherand she began to sink Here is an officers description of the finalscene    She heeled completely over and sank in eight and a half    minutes hundreds of men clambering over her side and standing    there just as if it were the upper deck waiting for the final    plunge But there was no plunge Slowly and slowly she sank and    as she went down some were sliding into the sea others taking    running leaps A few seconds more and there was no sign of her    left except her dead and living clustered in the water    together We were about three hundred yards away and watched    her go down and I was particularly struck with the ease and    slowness with which she sank Not till the waves had almost    entirely closed over her did the bow heave slightly out of the    water and she disappeared stern firstThe Bluecher went to her doom with her flag flying Some of the crewwhile waiting the order to leap into the water sang Die Wacht amRhein Officers were seen to shake hands and link arms together andthus sink into their watery grave Though the Germans had made noattempt to save the crews of the Monmouth and the Good Hope duringthe fight off Coronel and though our men were furious at the fiendishwork done by the German cruisers at Scarborough and the Hartlepoolsthey began the work of rescue at once Torpedo boats and pinnaces rushedto the scene to pick up survivors and light cruisers stood by to help    A cry of Jump went up from the deck of the Arethusa and    in a few seconds the sea was dotted thickly with men swimming    for their lives Most of them were equipped with a lifebelt of    inflated rubber and this supported them in the water until the    British boats were able to pick them up Among them were men who    had been wounded The faces of all were blackened with smoke    and in some cases the nerve of the men had almost completely    broken down in face of the severe ordeal through which they had    passed Their joy at escaping destruction found expression in    many ways The officers of whom eight were taken aboard the    Arethusa offered their rings watches and money to the    British sailors Our men wished for no reward for performing a    humane duty but the officers pressed the gifts upon them    saying You have saved our lives take these as little    mementos One of them speaking quite good English said with    a sigh of relief Its been a terrible time and I am jolly    glad its all overAbout one hundred and twenty men were saved from the Bluecher and morewould have been picked up but for the German aircraft which by thistime had arrived from Heligoland To the intense anger of our sailors aseaplane and a Zeppelin now began dropping bombs upon the rescueparties They were careful to give a wide berth to those vessels whichwere armed with the latest antiaircraft guns and confined theirattacks to the destroyers which promptly scattered and then proceededto drive them off The airmen no doubt thought that the Bluecher wasa sinking British ship and this may have given rise to the absurd talewhich was readily believed in Germany that one at least of our battlecruisers had been sunk                           We must now return to the leading ships of the British squadron Shortlyafter the Germans had changed course Admiral Beatty himself sighted theperiscope of a submarine on the starboard bow of the Lion andpromptly turned to port to avoid it At this time the flagship thoughshe had been under much fire had suffered but little At three minutespast eleven however she was struck in the bow by a chance shot whichdamaged her feed tank According to German accounts the Lion was thenabout seventy miles from Heligoland The accident for it was no moredisabled the Lion She had to reduce speed and fall out of the lineAdmiral Beatty at once called up the destroyer Attack and in itproceeded full speed in pursuit of the German squadronThe Lion moved away to the northwest and in the afternoon herengines began to give serious trouble The Indomitable which had bythis time settled with the Bluecher took the Lion in tow and aftersome hours of great anxiety brought her safely to port The towing homeof the Lion by the Indomitable was a very fine feat of seamanshipShe could only proceed at five knots an hour and at this snails pacewas a fair target for submarines None however dared attack her forshe bristled with torpedo defence guns and was surrounded bydestroyersBy twenty minutes past twelve the Attack overtook the PrincessRoyal on which Admiral Beatty hoisted his flag He now discovered thathis squadron had broken off the fight and was retiring northwards Wedo not know exactly why the enemy was not followed up but as theBritish ships were then only forty miles from the minefield it isprobable that the admiral in temporary command thought that his vesselswould be endangered if he proceeded any further After orders had beengiven to clear away and make for port the grimy stokers of thePrincess Royal swarmed on deck and greeted Admiral Beatty with a shoutof Well done David                           Only by sheer good luck did any of the German ships escape Had theLion not been disabled or had the squadron included another battlecruiser it is probable that none of the German ships would have reachedhome to tell the tale There was much disappointment in Britain when itwas known that only the slowest and weakest of the German Dreadnoughtshad been accounted for Our losses were few only fourteen men had beenkilled and six wounded no British vessel had been lost the Lion hadbeen hit fifteen times and the Tiger eight times but the damage wassoon repaired and when a party of journalists visited the ships in thefollowing October they could not see the scars of battle until they werepointed out The Germans lost the Bluecher the Seydlitz andDerfflinger were very hard hit and many of their crews must haveperishedDuring the remainder of the year 1915 the German Fleet wisely remainedin harbour The German High Sea Fleet had become the Kiel Canal fleetand nothing more                           There was great excitement in the Forth ports when the good news wasreceived and thousands of eyes were turned seawards to watch for thehomecoming of the battle cruisers Shortly after four oclock the soundof cheering was heard A moment later ringing Hip hip hurrahsechoed from vessels farther up the river and from the misty dimness ofthe upper reaches Got em this time said a smiling old salt on boarda minesweeper Hark to the boysA batch of about 280 prisoners including the captain of the Bluecherwas taken to Edinburgh Castle As they were marched through the streetsof the city one of the men asked the officer in charge What place isthis When he was told that it was the capital of Scotland he smiledsuperior Oh no he said Edinburgh is in ruins and the Forth Bridgeis destroyed[Footnote 4 A nautical measure  6 ft][Illustration The Suez Canal at El KantaraPhoto Newspaper Illustrations Ltd]  CHAPTER IV  THE TURKISH DESCENT UPON EGYPTTwo days after the Battle of the Dogger Bank we learned that a Turkishforce was advancing upon Egypt Why were the Turks about to invade theLand of the Nile First of all because they believed that thefellahin[5] of Egypt were ready to revolt and join hands with themagainst the British The Egyptians are Mohammedans and are thereforelinked with the Turks by the bond of a common religion For threehundred years Egypt was part of the Turkish EmpireAs far back as the year 1517 Egypt became a Turkish province and fellunder the sway of the Sultan of Turkey In 1798 Napoleon tried to founda great empire of the East and invaded Egypt as the first step Hestormed Alexandria and won the Battle of the Pyramids but Nelsondestroyed his fleet in Aboukir Bay and he was forced to leave thecountry[Illustration Bedouin ArabsAdvance Guards of the Turkish Army whichinvaded Egypt in January 1915Photo Central News]The Turkish pasha who ruled Egypt soon afterwards made himselfindependent of the Sultan and his successor Ismail Pasha becameKhedive or Viceroy The overlordship of the Sultan was however stillsupposed to continue though it grew more and more shadowy as the yearspassed by Ismail governed his country badly and when it becamebankrupt Britain and France had to step in to protect the interests ofthose of their subjects who had lent money to the Egyptian GovernmentWhat was called the Dual Control was set up in 1879 and Britain andFrance became the real rulers of EgyptThe Dual Control lasted until 1882 when an Egyptian officer named ArabiPasha raised a rebellion with the watchword Egypt for the EgyptiansThe French were unwilling to take part in quelling this revolt so theBritish had to act alone Alexandria was bombarded and Arabi wasdefeated by Lord Wolseley at TelelKebir Thus the Dual Control cameto an end and Britain stood alone in EgyptRight well has Britain borne the white mans burden in the land of theNile When she began her work in Egypt the only notion of law in theminds of the fellahin was the unchecked will of the strong man armed  The good old rule the simple plan   That they should take who have the power   And they should keep who canIt has been said that Egypt requires two things for herprosperitywater and justice Britain has given Egypt both water andjustice The laws have been reformed and fair dealing between man andman is assured to the people The taxes are heavy but they are notunfair and Egypt now pays her way Schools and colleges have beenopened and Britain has striven with all her might to make the lot ofthe people happier and betterBritain has been equally careful to give the country as good awatersupply as possible She has strengthened and altered the great damor barrage which was built across the Nile at the point where it dividesinto the Rosetta and Damietta branches for the purpose of storing upwater to irrigate the Delta regularly throughout the year The wholecanal system of the country has been overhauled and greatly improved AtAssiut and higher up the river at Aswan huge bars of solid masonryhave been thrown across the Nile and stretches of the river have beenturned into vast lakes These dams store up sufficient water to fill thesummer canals of Upper and Middle Egypt Never before has thecultivated area of the Nile Valley had a supply of water for the fieldsduring both summer and winter Further by conquering the Sudan Britainhas gained control of the upper waters of the NileThough Britain has done so much for Egypt we must not suppose that allthe Egyptians are content with her rule The great bulk of the peopleare quite satisfied to live and flourish under British control butthere are some pashas who long for the good old days when the peoplewere at their mercy Amongst these discontented persons German andTurkish agents have long been busy trying to bribe them to rise againstthe British Government By the beginning of the war they had won overthe Khedive to their side and in January 1915 they believed that theEgyptians were ready to take up arms against their rulers As a matterof fact the Egyptians as a whole had no intention of doing anything ofthe kind They remained quite calm even when the Turk was knocking attheir gates Very few of them wished to bring back the old days ofTurkish tyranny and misgovernmentAnother reason why the Turks prepared to descend upon the land of theNile was that on 17th December 1914 we announced to all the world thatthenceforth Egypt was a British possession The traitor Khedive had beendeposed and a new ruler who was friendly to the British Government hadbeen set up in his place Up to this time the British had recognized theoverlordship of the Sultan of Turkey Now they did away with italtogether and the Turks saw that the last vestige of their hold onEgypt had vanishedIn January our forces in Egypt consisted of Australians and NewZealanders Territorials from Great Britain Indian troops and ofcourse the regular Egyptian army The Germans thought that if theTurks made an attack on the country Britain would be forced to keeplarge forces in Egypt and that she would therefore be unable tostrengthen her armies on the Western front For these reasons politicaland military a Turkish expedition was prepared in Syria for theinvasion of Egypt It was 65000 strong and was led by Djemel Pashawho cherished a deep hatred for BritainTo reach Egypt from Syria this force had to cross an almost waterlessdesert which varied in breadth from 120 to 150 miles Across thisdreary tract of rock and sand there were three routes all of themdifficult The first ran from El Arish on the Mediterranean coast toEl Kantara on the Suez Canal It was 120 miles long and except for afew muddy wells there was no water on the road If you look at the mapbelow you will see a road crossing the base of the Sinai Peninsulafrom Akaba at the head of the Gulf of Akaba to Suez at the southernend of the Suez Canal This road was the old pilgrim route from Egypt tothe holy city of Mecca It is 150 miles long and there are but fewwells by the way From El Arish you will observe another road whichstrikes south and meets the pilgrims road about midway between Suezand Akaba This road runs through a dry valley in which it was possibleto lay down a light railway Only by these routes could the Turks reachEgypt from Syria[Illustration The Suez Canal and the Sinai District]You will notice that before the Turks could set foot in Egypt they wouldhave to cross the Suez Canal which could not be turned because it runsfrom sea to sea If the Turks could seize the Suez Canal they wouldcommand our short route to India and would be able to impede greatlythe bringing of troops to Europe from the East No doubt this wasanother of the reasons which led the Turks to make a descent upon EgyptSo important is the Suez Canal to the defence of the country that I mustbriefly describe itThe canal is nearly 100 miles long76 miles of it actual canal and 24miles of dredged and buoyed waterway through lakes In all this lengththere is not a single lock The canal varies in width from 80 to 120yards and it is deep enough to float the heaviest of DreadnoughtsBegun in 1859 it was completed ten years later at a cost of16000000 It is not the property of any one nation but the UnitedKingdom is by far the largest shareholder it holds 35 per cent of thesharesLet us follow the course of the canal For the first few hours the canalcrosses the shallow arm of the Mediterranean known as Lake Menzala Twolong parallel embankments cross this socalled lake which is veryshallow and is studded with rocks When this section is passed we havethe red sands of the desert to right and left of us Side by side withthe canal runs a sweetwater canal It is a simple ditch and its coursecan everywhere be traced by the grass and trees which flourish along itsmargin Except for this fringe of verdure no vegetation but desertscrub can be seenAt the station of El Kantara there is a ferry and here one maysometimes see caravans of Arabs with laden camels setting out on ajourney across the desert to El Arish Later in the day we cross LakeBalh pursuing our way between rows of buoys Another stretch of canalfollows and we cross Lake Timseh and see away on our right the town ofIsmailia from which a railway strikes off westwards Then comes anotherlong straight channel with high sand dunes on the left bank We passthe signal station of Toussm set in a pleasing frame of trees and twoand a half miles further on is Serapeum We now steam across the BitterLakes which are said to represent an old arm of the Red Sea Afterthese lakes are passed we enter the last stretch of the canal andfinally reach Suez beyond which lies the Red SeaDuring our voyage we notice that the ground to the east of the canal isvery flat and that from the deck of our ship or from the higher groundon the western bank we can see far and wide over the desert acrosswhich the Turks would have to advance Just south of El Kantara andagain between Lake Balh and the Bitter Lakes there are sand dunes butelsewhere there is no cover for an attacker The defenders of Egyptthought it probable that the Turks would make their descent upon thecanal along the line of the sand dunesBy 28th January small advanced parties of Turks had crossed the desertOne party marching by the direct route from El Arish to El Kantara wasmet and driven back by Gurkhas another party advancing by the roadfrom Akaba suffered the same fate On 2nd February the main attack wasdelivered by about 12000 troops who had marched along the valley fromEl Arish towards the Sinai Peninsula When they were about four hoursdistant from the canal they divided into two columns and proceededwestwards One column moved towards the sand dunes opposite to Ismailiawhile the second and much stronger column pushed on towards ToussmSmall flanking attacks were also made against El Kantara and Suez[Illustration Fighting at the Suez Canal February 24 1915]The advance of the enemy had been known for some days and our troopswere in position ready to meet it They were full of confidence andwere quite sure that the Turks would never enter Egypt save asprisoners As the sun sank in a flaming sky on 2nd February our patrolssaw the enemy moving towards the hummocks of sand that fringe the canalWhen night fell the Turks pushed their main force through the scrub anddunes towards a gap which gave them an easy road to the canal oppositeToussm The Turks had dragged across the deserts in carts sometwentyfive or thirty galvanized iron pontoons each weighing about 850lbs When they approached the canal the pontoons were shouldered by menand carried towards the water By means of these pontoons and a fewrafts made out of kerosene tins with a wooden frame the Turks proposedto cross the canalThe first warning of the enemys approach was given by a sentry of amountain battery who heard voices across the water Soon the noiseincreased The Turks were loudly encouraging each other by crying out inArabic Brothers die for the faith we can die but once and soforth The defenders were on the alert but they were in no hurry tofire They did not even pull their triggers when the invaders werecarrying the pontoons down to the canal Not until numbers of the enemywere crowded together under the steep bank and were pushing theirpontoons into the water did the machine guns and rifles of the Britishbegin to rattle Then the fire was deadly the Turks were speedily mowndown and the pontoons riddled with bullets were soon at the bottom ofthe canal[Illustration The Turkish Attack on the Suez CanalBy permission of The SphereOn the night of February 2nd 1915 two Turkish columns numbering about12000 in all moved towards the canalthe front and smaller columnagainst Ismalia the second against Toussm Our illustration shows thelatter attack in progress To the right the Turks are seen advancingunder heavy shell and rifle fire and vainly trying to launch boats Tothe left are the Punjabis resisting the attack The Turks were drivenback at this point and an attempt to cross at Ismalia suffered asimilar fate The Turks retired in good order and unfortunately wereable to march back to Syria without much molestation]The Turks now lined the banks and redoubled their efforts to getacross    They first tried to get men across by boats and by swimming in    order to hold a place as a bridgehead Five boats filled with    riflemen were rowed over three sank with most of their    occupants and two touched the western bank One boatload    charged up the bank but not a man reached the top The crew of    the other boat jumped into the water and getting ashore    scraped holes in the bank with their hands to make a temporary    shelter trench Most of them were shot and a few survivors gave    themselves up as soon as it was daylightA little torpedo boat with a crew of thirteen dashed to and frofiring pointblank at the enemy and smashing into fragments thepontoons which lay unlaunched on the bank The duel continued throughthe dark cloudy nightWhen morning dawned the battle became general all along the canal Theenemy brought up field guns and the British and French warships in thecanal joined in the fray A few Turks who had swum across the canalbegan to snipe our men from the rear but they were soon disposed ofThose who swam across later were deserters eager to surrenderAt about eleven in the morning two 6inch shells from the Turkishbatteries hit HMS Hardinge an old Indian marine transport One ofthe shells fell with a terrific crash on the bridge almost severing theleg of Pilot Carew He calmly looked down at his mangled leg andgripping the rail shouted Bring me a chair I am going to take thisship into port During the battle Pilot Carew received no fewer thaneighteen wounds The guns of the warships began to fire salvos and soonthe Turkish batteries were silencedNow that the pontoons of the enemy had been destroyed the Germancommander had been killed and the troops lying in cover had beenshelled out of their hidingplaces the Turks realized that theirattempt at invasion had hopelessly failed Halfhearted flank attacks atEl Kantara and Suez had been held up by our wire entanglements and thetime had arrived for our Indian troops to take the offensive Excellentartillery and rifle fire cleared the greater part of the eastern bankand by three oclock in the afternoon of 3rd February the Turks were infull retreat They had done nothing more than engage our outpost lineEarly next morning the British troops crossed the canal in force andbegan the work of rounding up the enemy Many Turks were found in ahollow and some of them held up their hands when our men approached Asa British officer advanced to take the surrender he was shot down Asharp fight with the cold steel followed during which one of ourofficers engaged a Turkish officer in single combat and ran him throughSome 400 dead were counted more than 600 prisoners were taken and thetotal Turkish casualties were probably well over 2000 For daysfollowing deserters drifted in and by 8th February there was not asingle Turk within twenty miles of the canalUnfortunately the bulk of the enemy with baggage and guns got awaysafely A heavy sandstorm came on and our Camel Corps were unable tofollow up the beaten and dispirited enemy Had this not happened it isprobable that the whole force would have been captured or destroyed TheTurks declared that their advance on the canal was merely for thepurpose of discovering the strength of the enemy and the character ofhis defences Whatever the object was it was not repeated during 1915Egypt remained unmolested for the rest of the year                           One incident which occurred during the fighting is worthy of specialmention An officer on board the torpedo boat which did such good workin harassing the enemy thus tells the story    It was now 3 pm so we went back down the canal to finish off    some boats which the Turks had abandoned inshore on the east    bank As the 3pounder could not get on to these we landed and    blew up two To get at the third boat it was necessary to go up    a gully some fifty yards inland where we could see the bow    sticking up The enemy held this bank so of course we were    under fire the whole time I called for volunteers and a    sublieutenant and a petty officer landed with me in a dinghy    We left an AB in her and darted up with our guncotton    charge I went ahead and got up to the boat when I saw five    Turkish soldiers on the other side about ten yards away I    stepped round the boat to have a shot at them and fell into a    trench full of Turks You never saw any one so surprised in your    life as they were and I myself confess to a certain    astonishment    I was too close to them to allow them to get their rifles on    me and realizing that every second was of value I gave one    whoop and dived out of the trench The sublieutenant shot a    fellow who stuck his head over to pot me and all three of us    trekked back to the dinghy under a heavy fire at about thirty    yards range The Australian and Indian troops holding the west    bank opened fire to cover our retreat as did also the torpedo    boat It really seemed as if the air was full of leadone long    continuous whistle overhead and the sand all round flying up in    spurts I was still laughing from the comic expressions I had    seen on the faces of the Turks in the trench nevertheless I    got over the ground like a twoyearold We had thirty yards to    row to the torpedo boat and would you believe it we all got    aboard untouched I did not blow up that boat as I saw it had    already been riddled with bullets from the other bank[Footnote 5

return to the battle front in the West and see how theAllies fared during the months of January and February You willremember that when the year 1914 closed the rival armies were facingeach other in trenches which extended over wellnigh 500 milesfrom theNorth Sea across the flats of Flanders through the coalfield of NorthFrance along the ups and downs of the Oise Valley and the heights ofthe Aisne through the Forest of Argonne into Lorraine along every highvalley of the Vosges right through Alsace to within sight of Alpinesnows The cold and storms of winter had put an end to operations on alarge scale but scarcely a day passed without artillery duels and localattacksWhen General Joffre was asked to describe his operations during thewinter months he replied We are nibbling away at them He was not yetstrong enough to pierce the German lines on a large scale even if theweather had permitted him to do so His policy was to wear down theGermans by provoking attacks in which they were likely to lose more menthan the Allies You know that the Germans believe in attacking andthat they consider it the best form of defence In modern warfare theattackers always lose more men than the defendersLet us look for a moment at the position of the Germans in the month ofJanuary They had overrun Belgium and they held a very valuable part ofNorth France but otherwise they had made many mistakes and had failedto accomplish what they had set out to do They had aimed at Paris buthad never got there they had flung away life like water to reach theChannel ports but had failed to capture them they had intended a shortwar in which victory would be achieved before the Allies could meetthem on equal terms but they were now faced by a long struggle Everyday the Allies were bringing fresh troops into the field and weremaking good their many deficiencies Meanwhile the Germans by theirbrutal treatment of the poor people who had fallen into their hands hadlost the sympathy of every civilized countryGermany was now at the very top of her field strength It was calculatedthat she was losing some 260000 men every month and that as time wenton she would be less and less able to bring up reserves with which torepair the wastage of war Experts declared that by the end of the yearor by the end of the following January the supply of German reserveswould fail and the armies in the field would then begin to decline innumbers and in quality On the other hand the Allies had not yet comeanywhere near their possible strength The new British armies which hadbeen under training since September would be ready in the springFrance was forming at least three new armies and the Russians hoped tobe able to equip their third and fourth millions and put them in thefield some time in April Great efforts were being made by the Allies toincrease their artillery and it was expected that in the early summerthey would be able to strike a decisive blow In these circumstances itwas to Germanys interest to strain every nerve to win during the earlymonths of the yearIt was thought by the Allies that the great German effort would be madein the West but as we shall see in later chapters they were mistakenThe Germans launched their chief attacks against the Russians who bythe middle of the year were so woefully lacking in munitions that theywere forced to retire eastwards from the Vistula for about two hundredmiles and owing to this misfortune the big push of the Allies in theWest had to be postponedNow let us see what actually happened in the West during January andFebruary You already know that until the new armies of the Allies wereready to take the field and the British supply of big guns and shellswas greatly increased they could do nothing but worry portions of theGerman frontSuch being the policy of the Allies you will not expect to hear of bigbattles The story of the fighting during January and February is therecord of small thingsa sandhill won east of Nieuport a trench ortwo near Ypres a corner of a brickfield near La Basse a few hundredyards near Arras a farm on the Oise a mile in northern Champagne acoppice in the Argonne a hillock on the Meuse part of a wood on theMoselle some of the high glens in the Vosges and a village or two inAlsace A cartoon published in a German comic paper in January showedtwo French Staff officers measuring the days advance with a footruleNo doubt the gains were small but we must remember that our object wasnot so much to win ground as to take toll of the two million Germansholding the trenches and by reducing their numbers bring the day oftheir exhaustion nearerWe will begin our story with the BelgianFrench forces on the Yser Theythen held the bridgehead at Nieuport and the whole western bank of theriver During January the Germans fiercely shelled the chief centres inthe little bit of Belgium over which King Albert still held swayThe German right rested on the dunes fronting the sea and their bigguns amongst the sandhills had Nieuport at their mercy On 28th Januarythe Allies attacked the Great Dune which lies just east of Nieuportand managed to win a good position from which they could sweep the eastbank of the Yser and protect their own left wing Nothing else ofimportance happened in this section for the next two monthsOn the Ypres salient trenches were taken and retaken during January andthe first fortnight of February On the last day of February PrincessPatricias Regiment of Canadian Light Infantry distinguished itself in abrilliant little affair This regiment which consisted almost entirelyof old soldiers many of whom possessed medals for previous war servicehad been equipped by Mr Hamilton Gault of Montreal LieutenantColonelF D Farquhar was appointed colonel and the founder of the regimentbecame second in command with the rank of major The regiment was namedafter Princess Patricia the younger daughter of the Duke of Connaughtthen GovernorGeneral of Canada[Illustration Canadians on Salisbury PlainPhoto Sport and GeneralA portion of Stonehenge the oldest monument in the British Isles isseen in the background It was ancient in the days when Boadicea calledher kinsmen to arms against the Romans]Princess Patricia embroidered colours and presented them to the regimenton August 23 1914 when she wished the men good luck and said thatshe should follow their fortunes with deep interest In due course theregiment which was generally known as Princess Pats arrived withthe Canadian contingent at Plymouth and after training on SalisburyPlain where most of the men had their first experience of the rainsleet and slush of an English winter was dispatched to France wherethe Christmas dinners were eaten within sound of the guns By 26thJanuary they had become inured to the hardships of the trenches and hadalready suffered casualties On the 28th of February when they wereholding a position not far from St Eloi about two miles south ofYpres the regiment was ordered to capture a German trench Thefollowing brief account of the affair is from the pen of a corporal whotook part in it    On the last day of February just before dawn our company was    ordered to attempt to force one of the German trenches As we    climbed over the parapet the enemy by means of their magnesium    flares spotted us and immediately opened up on us a withering    machinegun fire We lost mensome of my best friends and    comradesbut on we kept plodding through a quagmire of mud    and when we jumped over the enemys parapet into their trench    we had to tramp over dead men The rest of the Huns afraid of    cold steel fled screaming like children or went down on their    knees and begged for mercy This in true British fashion was    granted themThe attack was led with great dash and spirit by Lieutenants Crabbe andPapineau the latter of whom received the distinguished Service Orderfor conspicuous gallantry on the occasion He was in charge ofbombthrowers during the attack He shot two of the enemy himself andthen ran along the German sap throwing bombs into it As soon as thenews of the success became known congratulations were poured upon thegallant fellows They were the first of all Canadian regiments to comeinto prominence and they had given ample evidence of that gallantrywhich was soon to be exhibited on a larger scale and to thrill theEmpire with pride                           There were other similar successes on the Ypres salient but the almostcontinual rain snow and fogs of the latter part of February madeimportant attacks almost impossible[Illustration The La Basse Canal in Time of Peace]  CHAPTER VI  WINTER WARFARE ON THE WESTERN FRONTIIThe heaviest winter fighting in the British section of the front tookplace in the neighbourhood of La Basse The German Emperors birthdayoccurs on 27th January and his soldiers were eager to present him witha success in order to commemorate the event If you look at the map onpage 52 you will see to the east of the hamlet of Cuinchy south of thecanal a district marked Brickfields Still further east you observe atriangle of ground bounded by three railway lines The British 3rdBrigade was holding a sharp salient in this district Its left rested onthe canal its centre was pushed forward towards the railway triangleand its right was on the road running from Bethune to La Basse All theground was covered with old kilns and smoke stacks and a few hundredyards behind our first line we had constructed a keep of bricksOn 24th January the Germans shelled our position hoping to smash thecanal lock and so flood our trenches About six oclock next morning aGerman deserter came in to our lines and warned us that an attack wouldbe made in about half an hour Deserters had so frequently told similartales that we took no notice of him The man however had told thetruth and the halfhour had scarcely ended when a tremendousbombardment began Our firstline trenches which were held by half abattalion each of the Scots Guards and Coldstream Guards were blown inand before the damage could be repaired the Germans flung forward greatnumbers of men for an attack After a severe tussle in which our menused the bayonet with great effect they were forced to fall back acrossthe brickfields The London Scottish and the 1st Camerons with theremainder of the Coldstream and Scots Guards were ordered up to holdthe second line These troops fought hard and punished the Germansseverely with rifle and machinegun fire but so numerous were theattackers that they managed to get in amongst the brick stacks and intothe communication trenches on both sides of the keep and even to thewest of itMuchneeded reinforcements were pushed forward and at one oclock acounterattack was begun Together with the French on their right ourtroops moved forward in short swift rushes taking cover behind pilesof bricks or lying close on the soggy ground Good progress was made onthe flanks but the centre could not advance Late in the afternoonanother battalion was sent up in support and the struggle continuedthroughout the night By the morning of the 26th we had cleared out theenemy between the keep and our trenches and had partially recoveredthe ground lost in the morning The Germans had paid heavily for theirtrifling gain Fiftythree prisoners were captured and over a thousandGerman dead strewed the brickfields[Illustration The Fighting in Givenchy VillageFrom the drawing by Alfred Bastien By permission of The IllustratedLondon NewsThe mining village of Givenchy stands on high ground and commands thehighroad from Bethune to La Basse Our illustration shows the fiercefighting in the village on January 25 1915 when our men in many casesfought with bayonets in their hands and even knocked out many Germanswith their fists In the above drawing British troops includingHighlanders are seen advancing from the left]Meanwhile an equally severe fight was going on north of the canal TheGermans heavily bombarded the coveted village of Givenchy which we hadheld ever since the second week of the preceding October At 815 theyswarmed out of their trenches passed over our front trenches and brokeinto the village where a furious struggle raged in the streets and inthe houses for more than an hour Our men says Eyewitness in manycases fought with bayonets in their hands and even knocked out manyGermans with their fists A story is told of one man who broke into ahouse held by eight Germans He bayoneted four and captured the restwhile he continued to suck at a clay pipeFive separate times the Germans attacked the northeast corner ofGivenchy but each time they were driven back with great loss On thewhole continues Eyewitness the 25th January was a bad day for theenemy in this portion of their line The German birthday gift to theKaiser was a heap of his own dead[Illustration Sketch Map to illustrate the Fighting near La Basse ofthe 1st Corps January 2526 1915]For the next ten days the struggle continued On the 29th the Germansagain attacked south of the canal and tried to get into the keep bymeans of scaling ladders but were beaten off with severe losses On 1stFebruary very early in the morning the Coldstreams were driven fromtheir trenches south of the canal and two counterattacks failed torecover them As the light grew better our artillery came into actionand so accurate a fire was kept up on the lost trenches that the Germanscould not hold them At ten oclock fifty men of the 2nd Coldstreams andthirty men of the Irish Guards along with sappers carrying sandbags andbarbed wire rushed forward and not only recovered the lost trenchesbut seized one of the enemys posts on the embankment of the canal Itwas during this attack that LanceCorporal Michael OLeary won theVictoria Cross by a remarkable feat of gallantry which will be describedin the next chapter    Our men says Eyewitness were enabled to take in flank one    of the enemys trenches to the south and they fought their way    along it throwing hand grenades until they dislodged the    Germans from a considerable length We thus established    ourselves firmly in a good position on the canal bank and in the    adjoining trenches During the action we captured fourteen    prisoners and two machine guns also many wounded Our losses    were not severe but the enemy suffered heavily especially from    our artillery fire    Our men were in excellent spirits    after the encounter and on being relieved somewhat later    marched back to their billets singing to the accompaniment of    mouth organs and the roar of gunsAbout 2 pm on the night of the 5th6th February the British and Frenchartillery turned their heavy howitzers on the railway triangle andbegan a fierce bombardment The boom of the guns and the roar of theexploding shells were clearly heard twenty miles away and to those nearat hand the noise was terrific One lyddite shell blew a house bodilyinto the air while others exploding amongst the brick stacks wroughtawful havoc amongst the enemy At 215 am an attack was launched at astrong position held by the Germans amidst stacks of bricks Ourstorming columns rushed the position from three sides at once andcaptured it with very little loss Prisoners afterwards said that thenoise of the bursting shells and the thick clouds of dust which aroseprevented them from hearing or seeing our men until they were almostupon them Other trenches were captured and the next day the Germanstried hard to recover the lost ground Our gunners however were toomuch for them and succeeded in destroying one of their heavy batteries                           I have told you the story of these small fights to give you an idea ofhow the nibbling process was carried on Dozens of similar encounterstook place in various parts of our line and in all of them the Germanslost more heavily than we did You will notice that early in Februaryour artillery was able to compete with that of the Germans Every daymore and more big guns and more and more shells were sent to the frontThe time was soon to arrive when a big combined effort could be made topierce the German line  CHAPTER VII  STORIES FROM THE BATTLEFIELDYou are now to read some soldiers stories of the fighting during thewinter months The first story tells how Algerian horsemen by a skilfulruse managed to get a footing in the Great Dune[6] between the Ostendroad and the seaOne morning six fine Arab horses strayed as though by accident betweenthe French and German lines The Germans did not fire on the horsesbecause they hoped to capture them when they came sufficiently near totheir trenches The animals however wandered off again Towardsnightfall on the following day twentyfour Arab horses appeared on thesame ground In the half light the Germans could only just distinguishthe forms of the animals and perceive that they were unmounted Theywere preparing to seize them when suddenly a sharp cry was heard andthe horses kicking up their heels galloped back to the French linesAlmost immediately twentyfour gray forms rose from the ground anddashed towards the German trench They were Algerians who had concealedthemselves under the bodies of their horses and had thus got close tothe German line They rushed upon the enemy and a furious struggle tookplace The Germans in the second line dared not fire for fear ofshooting their own comrades The Algerians managed to get a footing inthe German trench and shortly afterwards French infantrymen rushed upto their support By ten in the evening a portion of the Great Dune hadbeen won                           Sniping went on almost continuously during the winter A Canadianofficer thus describes his adventures while scouting in front of theGerman trenchesOff I went crawling through the sodden clay and branches going abouta yard a minute listening and looking I went out to the right of ourlines where the Germans were nearest At last I saw the Hun trench Itwas about ten yards from me I waited for a long time and then I heardsome Germans talking and saw one of them put his head up over somebushes behind the trench I could not get a shot at him as I was toolow down Of course I could not get up so I crawled on again veryslowly to the parapet of their trenchIt was exciting I peered through their loophole but saw nobody in thetrench Then the German behind put up his head again He was laughingand talking I saw his teeth glisten against my foresight and I pulledthe trigger He just gave a grunt and crumpled up His comrades behindthe bushes got up and whispered to each other There were five of themThey could not place the shot I was flat behind their parapet andhidden I just had the nerve not to move a muscle and stay there myheart was fairly hammering They did not advance so I crept back inchby inchThe next day just before dawn I crawled out there again and foundthe trench still empty Then a single German came through the woodstowards the trench I saw him fifty yards off He was coming alongupright quite carelessly making a great noise I heard him before Isaw him I let him get within twentyfive yards and then shot himNothing happened for ten minutes Then there were noise and talkingand a lot of Germans came along through the wood behind the trenchabout forty yards from me I counted about twenty and there were morecoming They halted in front I picked out the one I thought was theofficer I had a steady shot at him He went down and that was all IsawI went back at a sort of galloping crawl to our lines and sent amessage that the Germans were moving in a certain direction in somenumbers Half an hour afterwards they attacked the right in massedformation advancing slowly to within ten yards of our trenches Wesimply mowed them down It was rather horrible There were 200 of themdead in a little bit of our line and we only lost tenOur boys were rather pleased at my stalking and getting the messagethrough All our men have started stalking now It is quite a popularamusement[Illustration The Three Musketeers of Princess Patricias OwnPainted by S Begg from material supplied by an officer of PrincessPatricias Canadian Light Infantry present at the action By permissionof The Illustrated London News]Princess Pats Own first went into the firing line on 5th JanuaryThe trenches in which they received their baptism of fire were onlyabout a hundred yards away from those of the Germans who subjected themto a very heavy bombardment About the second or third night three ofthe men established themselves during the darkness on a mound a littleto the rear of the Canadian position They cut a couple of dugouts inthe base of the mound and fortified the top with a few bricks behindwhich they took cover At daybreak they discovered that they commanded avery fine view of the German firstline trench and of its supporting orreserve dugouts which were occupied by the Prussian Guard There wasno shell fire from the British at the time and the Germans thinkingthemselves quite safe were strolling about between the dugouts and thetrench The three musketeers on the mound opened a brisk fire on theGermans whereupon they scuttled off to their holes like rabbits butnot before nine or ten of them lay on the ground wounded or killed Allday long the men on the mound were under every kind of fire but theystuck it without flinching and in their turn kept the enemy from asmuch as showing a finger When darkness fell they retired to theirtrenches Only one of the men was hurt and he had only a slight bulletwound in the hand                           Here is a strange story of how some British soldiers foolishly andrecklessly risked their lives in order to settle a betFighting had been very severe in front of one section and during alull an officer was surprised to see a number of khakiclad figuresfully exposed to the German bullets should the enemy resume firingThey were peering into the trench and were so deeply interested in whatwas down below that they did not notice the officers approachWhat have you got there he askedA dead German sir came the replyA dead German What on earth are you doing with a dead GermanThen he was told the whole story It appeared that in the course of theattack the British soldiers had noticed a particularly tall and bulkyHun When the fighting was over they began to discuss his proportionsHe was now lying dead in front of the trench and two of the men made abet about his height and weight To settle the bet they crawled outand risked death in order to drag the dead German in He was found to besix feet nine inches in height and to have a waist measurement offiftythree inchesThe officer gave the men a severe warning and then asked how much thebet was To his amazement he received the following reply A bobsir                           In a dispatch published by Sir John French during February he regrettedthat it was impossible for him to bring before the notice of the publicmany acts of gallantry performed by his men Here is an account of avery brave deed done by a sergeantmajor in the North Somerset Yeomanrythe story is told by a corporal of the same regimentI had a marvellous escape A German bomb fell in the trench barely afoot from me I did not see it coming and nothing could have saved meor Dick Moody or the other fellows with us had not SergeantMajorReeves made a dash for it He picked up the bomb pulled out the fuseand threw it out of the trench It was the bravest thing I have everseenLater on when our men became more used to grenade fighting suchincidents were of almost everyday occurrence Over and over again menpounced upon live bombs and hurled them back towards the enemystrenches before they had time to explode                           On one part of our line the trenches of friend and foe were so close toeach other and they changed hands so often that it was difficult toknow at any particular moment whether they were held by British or byGermans One night after a fight two British officers set out todiscover whether certain trenches were occupied by their own men or bythose of the enemy They soon chanced upon a communication trench whichseemed to lead in the desired direction They walked down it and cameto a dugout with a candle burning in it and German equipment scatteredabout Thinking that the communication trench had been captured theyblew out the candle and pushed on At length they reached a trenchrunning at right angles to the communication trench No sooner had theyentered it than they were challenged sharply in German Then came ashower of bullets and in a moment the officers were rushing back bythe way which they had come with Germans close upon their heels Theyfloundered through the mud and dodged round the traverses and thanksto the darkness managed to get back to their own lines unhurt wherethey told their comrades how they had spent several breathless minutesin the enemys fire trenches                           Now I must give you an account of one of the most striking deeds ofgallantry ever performed by a British soldier The Gazette of 18thFebruary contained an announcement that the Victoria Cross had beenawarded toLanceCorporal Michael OLeary 1st Battalion Irish Guards for anachievement of such a character that according to Sir Arthur ConanDoyle no writer of fiction would dare to fasten it on any of hischaractersAt sixteen years of age OLeary joined the Navy but was dischargedbecause he suffered with rheumatism He soon recovered however andenlisted in the Irish Guards After serving his time with the coloursand passing into the reserve he was accepted as a member of the famousNorthWest Mounted Police of Canada The hard openair life was much tohis liking All the patrol work was done on horseback and he rode on anaverage thirty miles a day As a NorthWest mounted policeman OLearygave a taste of his cool courage in capturing two robbers armed withrevolvers after a running fight which lasted two hours For this feathe was presented with a gold ring which he still proudly wears Thedonor of it must have been a prophet for he said to OLeary whenhanding it over If you do as well on active service you will win theVictoria Cross At the outbreak of war OLeary rejoined his oldregiment in France He was not then twentyfive years of ageI am sure you remember the occasion when the Coldstreams were drivenfrom their trenches near Cuinchy and two counterattacks failed torecover them At ten in the morning of 1st February a desperate effortto win them back was made by fifty men of the 2nd Coldstream Guards andthirty men of the Irish Guards accompanied by sappers with wire andsandbags The Coldstreams went first With fixed bayonets they rushedacross the 200 yards that separated them from the German trenches Theywere met by a heavy fire which checked them a little and then theIrish Guards went forward in support OLeary fleet of footoutdistanced his comrades He had not gone far before he felt the groundgive beneath his feet and springing back he saw a German bombthrowerin a pit He shot the man and hurrying on to the angle of a barricadewhich he had marked all day fired five shots and killed the fiveGermans who were holding it Leaving his comrades to take possession ofthe barricade he dashed towards a second position sixty yards aheadwhere a machinegun section was frantically trying to turn its weaponupon the stormers OLeary however was too quick for them A Germanofficer had his finger on the button of the gun and was about torelease the hail of lead when crack went our heros rifle and theofficer dropped dead Again and again OLeary fired and two other menfell while their comrades with white scared faces threw up theirhands and begged for mercy A few moments later and the Guards with awild rush through the flying mud secured the position LanceCorporalOLeary thus practically captured the enemys position himself andprevented the rest of the attacking party from being fired on He waspromoted sergeant on the field[Illustration The Great Exploit of LanceCorporal Michael OLearyFrom the picture by A C Mitchell By permission of The IllustratedLondon News]Sergeant OLeary VC had a great reception when he returned to Londonin July on leave A demonstration was held in Hyde Park by the UnitedIrish League and the hero who was presented with a purse of gold madea recruiting speech in the course of which he said There are manyothers who have fought and are fighting who have attempted and havedone more than I for King and country I have had the luck In his owncountry the sergeant was enthusiastically received and was so lionizedthat he said he must get back to the trenches to rest At a banquet tohis honour in his native county he asked for lemonade and when some onethoughtlessly pressed him to take wine he refused and said that hemust keep fit Not only did he receive the Victoria Cross at the handsof the King but the highest awards for valour from the French and theRussian Government[Footnote 6 See page 46]  CHAPTER VIII  THE GERMAN SUCCESS AT SOISSONSIn this British book written for British boys and girls I naturallygive the foremost place to the doings of British soldiers We musthowever always remember that up to the middle of the year the Britishonly held about onetwentieth of the Western battlefront From LaBasse through Arras to Noyon thence eastwards along the valley ofthe Aisne in a wide curve round the fortress of Verdun to the westbank of the Meuse onwards to the Moselle through Lorraine to thecrests of the Vosges and southwards to the borders of Switzerlandallthis long and varied line was held by our French Allies All throughJanuary and February they did not cease to nibble at the Germantrenches In Champagne in the section between the Meuse and theMoselle and in Alsace they were able to do more than nibblethey wereable to seize many vantage points and advance their front slowly butsurelyIn January the chief centre of interest was in that part of the Aisnevalley which lies to the north of the old city of Soissons[7] You willremember that the Allies had captured the city and the flat lands tothe north of it during the great advance in September 1914 Turn to themap on the next page and find the village of Cuffies[8] On 18th Januarythis village was in French hands and so was the village of Crouy[9] tothe east of it On the road from Soissons to Laon and between Cuffiesand Crouy you will notice a spur of the plateau marked Hill 132[10] Tothe southeast of Crouy there is another spur marked 151 On 8thJanuary the French made attacks on both these hills They speciallywished to capture Hill 132 because it would give them a gun positionfrom which they could command the road to LaonIn the drenching rain the French pushed forward dragging their gunswith great difficulty up the slippery slope They carried three lines ofGerman trenches and were soon in possession of the hill Meanwhileother troops had seized Hill 151 Though the Germans tried hard torecover the positions next day they could not do so Nothing happenedon Sunday 9th January but on Monday about noon no less than twoGerman corps under von Kluck were launched against the French whowere holding the hills On the 12th the struggle grew very violent TheFrench were pushed off the eastern side of Hill 132 but with greatdifficulty they managed to cling to the western slopes[Illustration]During the four preceding days the weather had been very bad Torrentsof rain had descended without ceasing and by the 12th the river was inhigh flood It had been rising for days and now it was swirling alonglike an angry torrent threatening to carry away the only bridges bywhich the French could bring up reinforcements and ammunition By the13th all the bridges but two had been swept away and the French decidedto retreat across the river while they had the means of doing soThey retired slowly and skilfully Their batteries were withdrawn fromthe hills one by one without letting the Germans know that they werebeing moved to the rear The commander of one battery did not give theorder to retire until the Germans were within five hundred yards of himIt was perilous and difficult work getting the guns down the steepslope The gunners manhandled them until they reached the foot andthen they were limbered up and taken across a shaky pontoon bridgewhich had been thrown across the river at Missy Guns on the right andcentre had to be abandoned but not before they were rendered uselessBy the evening of the 14th the Germans had advanced their line untilthey held the whole of the north bank of the Aisne from a mile east ofSoissons to Missy By this time the French who only numbered 12000had been reduced to half their strength and they had lost about twentyguns Von Kluck had begun well and under the eye of the Kaiser he nowmade a great effort to capture Soissons Had he done so he would havebeen in possession of a railway junction and the best bridge over theAisne He would also have been able to force the French to retire fromthe whole line of the riverThe floods had not reached Soissons so the French were able to pourreinforcements into the city A great struggle took place at the villageof St Paul on the right bank of the river about a mile to the east ofSoissons The Germans advanced in dense masses and won the village butthe French artillery speedily drove them out and von Kluck found thathe could advance no furtherThe Germans trumpeted abroad this little success as a smashing victorybut it was of no particular consequence for they had only slightlyimproved their position and in doing so had suffered a loss of at least10000 men It was not so much German guns and rifles that drove theFrench from the spurs which they had won as the flooding of the riverNature had fought for the Germans but still they could not make goodSome writers thought that it was very clever of von Kluck to postponehis big counterattack until his enemies had a swollen river and floodedfields behind them but the fact was that he could not attack earlierbecause his reinforcements were late in arriving The Germans owed theirsuccess not to good generalship but to good luck[Footnote 7 See Vol II p 237][Footnote 8 Kufee][Footnote 9 Crooee][Footnote 10 Unnamed hills are numbered on the map by their heightabove sealevel Thus Hill 132 means a hill which is 132 metres or 440ft in elevation]  CHAPTER IX  WINTER FIGHTING IN CHAMPAGNE THE ARGONNE AND THE VOSGESWe now come to that part of the French front on which the mostsuccessful attempts of the Allies were made during January and FebruaryYou have already heard of the little river Suippe a tributary of theAisne Between the upper waters of this river and the Forest of theArgonne there is a chalk plain dotted with plantations of firs andcrossed by rolling downs In many respects it resembles Salisbury Plainand for many years has been put to the same use Before the war it wasthe great training ground of French troops and the scene of their yearlymanoeuvres The plain is sparsely populated scattered farms andstraggling homesteads are few and far between and lack of villagesmeans lack of roads After heavy rain the whole district is a sea ofshallow mud but the ground does not become waterlogged and as soon asthe rain ceases the ground dries very quickly Operations during thewinter were therefore possible General Joffre decided to nibble morevigorously on this plain than elsewhereLook at the little map on page 70 You notice a railway running fromSte Menehould[11] on the Aisne at the edge of the Argonne forest toRheims By means of this railway the French troops operating on theplain were supplied with all their needs The Germans relied on the linewhich you see running from Grand Pr in the Argonne to Bazancourt Theobject of the French was to nibble at the German lines in the hope ofpushing back the enemy and seizing this railway If it could be cut orcommanded the Germans would be obliged to fall back along their wholeline At any rate a French advance towards the railway would compel theenemy to waste men and shells and would force him to keep in the regionlarge forces which otherwise would have been sent to the East where vonHindenburg was badly in need of assistanceI want you to fix your attention on the little towns of Souain[12] andPerthes[13] and the farm of Beau Sjour[14] all of which are marked onthe map Beau Sjour you will notice is about 3 miles east ofPerthes At the beginning of January the French line ran through Souainsouth of Perthes and south of Beau Sjour Almost every day duringJanuary the French attacked the German positions They won a hill to thenorth of Perthes which gave them the best gun position in theneighbourhood and on the 16th of February a general advance began TheGermans held a strong post north of the farm on a ridge between twolittle glens On this ridge they had constructed a fort which was heldby about 500 men                           The French attacked on a plan which was soon to become the regularmethod of puncturing the German lines all along the Western front Letme give you some account of this planthe only possible method ofcapturing the strongly fortified trenches of the enemy without aterrible loss of life As you know the first obstacle to an attack on aline of trenches consists of the barbed wire entanglements which arefixed up in front of them The attackers are held up by the network ofwire and can be shot down in droves by rifles and machine guns Thenthe trench itself has a strong parapet with loopholes through which thedefenders fire on the attackers For infantry to charge the barbed wirewhile the parapets are held by an enemy is to court almost certaindisasterStudy the diagram on page 67 AB is a line of trenches to be attackedand X is a line of big guns These guns throw a shower of high explosiveshells on to the enemys trenches So terrible is the explosion that thebarbed wire is blown into a thousand fragments the parapets are beatendown the whole trench is utterly wrecked and the defenders are eitherkilled or wounded or so stunned by the violence of the bombardment thatthey cannot make much resistance When this is done the gunners lifttheir sights and lengthen their fuses and behind the trench create at Ca curtain of fire through which no enemy reinforcements can possiblypass Then the attacking infantry rush forward and occupy the wreckedtrench They work away with their entrenching tools make a new parapetfacing the enemys second line of trenches and prepare to beat offcounterattacks Trenches are thus captured by gun fire alone You caneasily understand that advances made in this way will be slow Telephonewires have to be laid ranges calculated and a thousand detailsarranged before an assault can be made[Illustration]If such an attack is to succeed two things are necessary In the firstplace the attackers must have many big guns and an almost unlimitedsupply of ammunition for them and secondly they must bring up theirguns at X unknown to the enemy and take him by surprise If he is ableto see the big guns being brought up he will fire on them before theycan be concealed He will also mass his own guns and the affair willbecome an artillery duel on a large scale Happily in Champagne theFrench were able to mass their guns secretly Their airmen had become soexpert that they were able to beat back all the German aircraft thatattempted to scout over their lines while at the same time they couldfly over the German lines without much hindranceHere is a description of such an attack as seen by a British observer inChampagne    Looking at the battle at a distance of about 2000 yards from    the enemys lines the stillness of what one sees is in marked    contrast with the turmoil of shells passing overhead The only    movement is the cloud of smoke and earth that marks the burst of    a shell Here and there long white lines are visible when a    trench has brought the chalky subsoil up to the top but the    number of trenches seen is very small compared with the number    that exist for one cannot see into the valleys and the top of    the ground is an unhealthy place to choose for sitting in a    trench The woods are pointed out with the names given them by    the soldiers but it needs fieldglasses to see the few stumps    that remain when the artillery has done its work And then a    telephone message arrives saying that the enemy are threatening    a counterattack at a certain point and three minutes later    there is a redoubled whistling of shells At first one cannot    see the result of this firethe guns are searching the low    ground where the enemys reserves are preparing for the    movement but a little later the ground behind the threatened    trenches becomes alive with shell bursts for the searching has    given place to the building up of a wall of fire through which    it is impossible for the foe to pass without enormous lossWhen a successful attack of this kind is to be made on a large scalethe work of the directing staff must be very perfect Every trench inthe line of attack must be thoroughly shelled at the same time Ifcertain trenches are left unwrecked the infantry will be badly mauledwhen they move forward Then all the guns of the attacking side mustlift their sights and lengthen their fuses before the infantry reach theenemys trenches or the men will be caught by their own fireEverything must work together like a welloiled machine A singlemistake will be paid for by heavy loss of life[Illustration French Infantry returning to their Quarters after drivingthe Germans from their Trenches near St MihielFrom the picture by Paul Thuriot By permission of The SphereThe French infantry came back into their second line after the actionwith their bands playing and their colours flying Their uniforms werecovered with mud and they were as dirty as they could possibly beTheir comrades saluted the colours with love and devotion and theGerman prisoners seemed astonished to see such patriotic fervour]Such was the general character of the attacks made by the French inChampagne during February The ridge which I have already describedwas captured by French Colonial troops towards the end of January aftera months struggle but elsewhere progress was slow About five yards aday was the average gain One by one the little woods and ridges werecarried but as late as 24th March the French were not sufficiently nearthe railway from Grand Pr to Bazancourt to threaten it seriously Wemust not however reckon the gains by the amount of ground which waswon but by the number of men which the enemy was obliged to maintain onthis part of the front and by the losses which he suffered Some fiveand a half German corps which were badly needed in the East had to bemassed in Champagne and their losses were out of all proportion tothose suffered by the French It is said that the Germans lost 10000dead and 2000 prisoners during these attacks The famous Prussian Guardsuffered very heavily at a point about threequarters of a mile east ofBeau Sjour where two of their regiments were almost wholly destroyedThe Germans themselves admitted that their losses in Champagne weregreater than those of the Battle of the Mazurian Lakes[15] where theyhad some fourteen army corps engaged[Illustration Scene of the Fighting in Champagne]The severe fighting in Champagne drew off some or the Crown Princesforces and he was therefore obliged to slacken his efforts in theForest of the Argonne There too in January our Allies won a successby the capture of more than a mile of German trenches It is interestingto note that the regiment of Italian volunteers which captured thetrenches was led by LieutenantColonel Garibaldi a descendant of thefamous Italian patriot who played such a large part in bringing about aunited Italy During this woodland fighting the Germans also hadsuccesses but generally speaking there was a deadlock in this regionThe real zones of fighting were to the west and east of the Forest                           The line which the French held from Beau Sjour to Switzerland duringthe first four months of the year 1915 made a wide curve round thefortress of Verdun and then ran south across a wooded plateau to StMihiel on the left bank of the Meuse At St Mihiel the Germans wereclinging to a bridgehead which they had captured as far back asSeptember 1914 From St Mihiel the line crosses the river to the rightbank and then proceeds eastwards to the river Moselle It then strikessoutheastwards to the crest of the Vosges mountainsIf you look at the map on the next page you cannot fail to notice thatSt Mihiel is the point of a very marked wedge or salient somethinglike that at Ypres only with the point facing westwards instead ofeastwards A mile to the south of St Mihiel the Germans had a strongposition on high ground called the Camp of the Romans from which theycould command the country for ten miles around If you look at the mapon the next page you will see two railways within the salient The oneruns northwards from a place about five miles east of the Camp of theRomans and crosses the French line at a village called Les Eparges[16]the other runs northwards from a place about fifteen miles east of theCamp of the Romans and runs along the valley of a tributary of theMoselle past Thiaucourt[17] until it reaches the main river which itfollows to Metz The Germans had constructed a field railway whichenabled them to reach St Mihiel from ThiaucourtThe French nibbled unceasingly at this salient during the winter Theirobject was to squeeze in its sides so as to capture the railways andforce the enemy to withdraw from St Mihiel During February there wasfierce fighting at Les Eparges which was taken by the French along witha part of the neighbouring heights At the same time they pressednorthwards along the left bank of the Moselle and won the Wood of thePriest from which they bombarded the railway running throughThiaucourt They also smashed the German bridges at St Mihiel Day byday they were pinching the German wedge more and more and werethreatening the railways by means of which the Germans were able tomaintain themselves in this regionThe French were eager to capture the heights to the east of Les Epargesbecause guns on these heights would command much of the northern part ofthe salient The Germans knowing how important these heights were tothe French had turned them into a very strong fortress They had linedthe steep slopes with trenches and had honeycombed them with sheltersand dugouts About 4 pm on 5th April when the rain was fallingheavily and the hillsides were sodden the French made a great attackon these fortified heights They gained some ground but next morningthey were driven back That evening they made a second attempt and bymeans of bayonet charges captured 1500 yards of trenches and graduallyapproached the summit[Illustration The Fighting between the Meuse and the Moselle]Next morning the Germans brought up reinforcements and strove with alltheir might to hurl the French down the slopes The French gunshowever prevented the Germans from massing while the German guns heldoff the French On the morning of the 8th the French made another boldbid They could scarcely keep their footing in the slime and it is saidthat many of them were drowned in the mud Never was an attack madeunder greater difficulties Slipping in the greasy mud buffeted by thewind and almost blinded by the rain the French advanced againstendless machine guns posted at carefullychosen points So determinedwere the Germans to hold the position that they had chained the machinegunners to their weapons After an hours struggle the French won thesummit and managed to clear the Germans off the heights except for asmall triangle at the east endOn the morning of the 9th French reinforcements struggled up thehillside So violent was the storm and so miry was the ground thatthey took fourteen hours to reach their comrades In the afternoon anassault was made on the eastern triangle and the Germans were sweptfrom it A fog descended under cover of which the Germanscounterattacked and pushed the French back But as soon as the foglifted the French guns came into action and another bayonet charge wasmade By 10 pm the French held the whole of the spur and were able tocommand the northern part of the salient They had performed a notablefeat of arms during five days of tempest The German loss was estimatedat more than 30000Elsewhere the French also won ground On the south side of the salientwhere the country is covered with thick scrubby woods the fighting wasvery severe Small gains were made and by the month of May the Frenchwere about four miles from Thiaucourt and were able to hurl shells fromtheir heavy guns within the outer fortifications of Metz It seemed thatany further advance would endanger the whole position of the Germans atSt Mihiel and force them to retreat towards the highlands west ofMetz Nevertheless when the year 1915 came to an end the Germans werestill holding St Mihiel and the salient was theirs though it had wornvery thin                           Now let us briefly glance at the campaign in the VosgesLook closely at the map on the next page and notice the river Ill atributary of the Rhine Its most important feeder is the river Thurwhich runs down a long glen It was in the valley of this river that theFrench made their chief advances during the winter On 3rd January theChasseurs Alpins fighting their way down the valley of the Thurcaptured the village of Steinbach which stands just where the mountainsfall steeply to the Alsatian plain about ten miles as the crow fliesfrom Mulhouse Steinbach which had been converted by the enemy into aseries of blockhouses was only secured after ten days of deadly combatThe French were trying to take Mulhouse in flank and they had thereforeto capture the village of Cernay which blocked the way Meanwhileanother force attacked Altkirch to the south of Mulhouse and quiteclose to the Swiss border During the fighting some of the shellsactually fell on Swiss ground The force advancing from Steinbach couldnot capture Cernay so it turned to the south and tried to seize thevillage of Burnhaupt in order to attack Mulhouse from another angle Thevillage was taken by the French but was retaken though with heavyloss by the Germans Strive as they would the French could get nonearer to Mulhouse[Illustration]If you look to the north of Cernay you will see a spur of the Vosgesknown as Hartmannsweilerkopf It stands 2000 feet above the plain andconsists of rugged rocks covered with pine trees He who possesses thekopf can command a very large part of the plain for he can shell manyroads and railway lines The French greatly coveted it and they hadalready established a small advance post on it Let me tell you how thispost was lost and won again Soon after the fighting at Altkirchviolent winter storms began to rage Snow fell without ceasing for afortnight and the upper glens were choked with drifts When the skycleared the chasseurs donned their skis and made some daring raids onGerman posts in the hills The Germans were active too On 19th Januaryduring a blinding snowstorm they climbed Hartmannsweilerkopf andattacked the French post at the summit Four companies of chasseursmade a most gallant attempt to relieve the defenders and for two daysfought fiercely amidst the icy rocks and snowladen bushes They couldhowever make no headway and the post was captured by the Germans on21st JanuaryNot until the 27th of March was it recaptured On that day the ChasseursAlpins made a fierce onset and carried the last line of the Germandefence which was protected by a blockhouse Once more they were inpossession At once the Germans hurried up reinforcements from all partsof Alsace and the order went forth that the position was to berecaptured at all costs They attacked in dense masses with greatcourage and were able to entrench themselves hurriedly on the edge ofthe summit and along the slopes During the night however the FrenchAlpine troops were reinforced and by dint of tremendous efforts gunswere dragged up the icy slopes to the top of the spur and were placedin position on the right and left flanks of the enemy Next morning thechasseurs attacked the Germans and drove them back while the gunsassailed them with a terrible fire The enemy made a stubborn resistanceand brought up fresh troops specially trained for mountain warfare andsupplied with mountain guns For three days the struggle continued andat the end of it the whole of the slopes were clear of the enemy Therecapture of the spur was a great feather in the French cap Again andagain during the year the Germans made efforts to seize it and morethan once it fell into their hands Late in December the Germans claimedto have recovered the whole position but this was denied by the French[Illustration Chasseurs Alpins attacking a Custom House in the HighVosgesFrom the picture by Paul Thuriot By permission of The SphereThis incident took place in the district south of the Schlucht Pass Theblockhouse was defended by Germans A French lieutenant rushed forwardand attempted to batter down the door with his rifle but wasimmediately shot A second officer fell and then the men rushed thehouse and captured it The French soldiers shown in the picture areChasseurs Alpins Notice that some of them are on skis]For the rest of the year the battlefront in Alsace showed but littlechange The French held every gun position on the eastern slopes of theVosges and were in command of all the roads leading down to the plainsThe Germans held the plain and its railways and were able to oppose anymovement from the mouths of the valleys towards the Rhine The Frenchhad secured one great advantage Should they wish to push towards theRhine through the Gap of Belfort their left flank was secure[Footnote 11 Sant mehnou][Footnote 12 Sooahn][Footnote 13 Pert][Footnote 14 Boh sayjoor][Footnote 15 See Vol II chap ix][Footnote 16 Laysay parge][Footnote 17 Teekoor]  CHAPTER X  THE SUBMARINE BLOCKADE BEGINSSo far the Germans had failed hopelessly at sea The battle off Coronelhad been their only success and the squadron that had achieved it wasnow no more The bombardment of Scarborough Whitby and the Hartlepoolshad been hailed in Germany as a great victory and the enemy loudlyboasted that the British fleet no longer commanded the North Sea We athome were filled with anger but we showed no panic while in Americathe bombardment of innocent townsfolk in unfortified places was held tobe sheer murder and there were many jeers at the German commanders whohad struck foul blows at those who could not strike back and had thenrun away The German navy was covered with ridicule It dared not comeout and risk a battle while to sit still and do nothing was to proclaimitself a mere shamThe British fleet ever since the beginning of the war had stopped andsearched all merchant ships bound for ports on the North Sea and theBaltic Sea in order to ascertain whether they had on board contrabandof warthat is arms ammunition explosives or other articles ormaterials which might be used against us It is a rule of internationallaw that if such goods are sent by a neutral to a State which is at warthey may be seized by the enemy of that State We had sent lists to allneutrals setting forth the kinds of goods which we would not allow theenemy to receive and our warships had discovered many vessels whichwere laden with such goods These ships were taken into port and acourt sat to decide whether or not they were guilty of carryingcontraband If found guilty they were seized by the State You caneasily understand that the trade of neutrals with our enemies almostcame to an end The exporters of New York who were chieflyGermanAmericans found their business falling off greatly and theytried hard to stir up quarrels between the United States and GreatBritainThe United States had determined to be strictly neutral in the war Mostof the people were friendly to the Allies but there were about fourmillions of Germans Austrians and Hungarians in the country and manyof them were strongly in favour of the Central Powers Germany sentagents to stir up these people and to do everything in their power tobring about quarrels between Great Britain and the StatesThe Germans as you know were powerless on the seas while we wereallpowerful From the States we imported large quantities of munitionsof war The Americans would gladly have sent munitions to Germany alsobut as no German ship dared cross the Atlantic the Germans werealtogether cut off from this source of supply hence their anger withthe United States We shall see later that the German agents in theStates committed all sorts of crimes in the hope of stopping themanufacture of munitions and preventing their export to Great BritainAbout a week after the Hartlepools raid von Tirpitz who was then atthe head of the German Admiralty told the Americans that they hadstopped their trade with Germany because Great Britain had ordered themto do so and he asked them how they would like to see all trade withBritain stopped by German submarines Then came the Battle of the DoggerBank in which the German vessels scuttled for home as soon as theysighted the British fleet but in the course of their flight lost theBluecher It was after this discreditable affair that von Tirpitzdecided to carry out his threat He gave notice to the President of theUnited States that on and after 18th February the waters surrounding theBritish Isles would be considered to be within the seat of war and thatall enemy merchant ships found in these waters would be sunk by Germansubmarines He also said that it might not always be possible to savethe crews and the passengers of these ships and that neutral vesselswithin this zone of war would be exposed to danger and might even besunk To this the President replied begging Germany to considercarefully before taking any such action and warning her that thedestruction of a United States ship or the death of American citizenswould be considered an unfriendly act which might lead to war ThePresident then went on to point out that until a blockadethat is acomplete stoppage of sea tradecould be carried into effect the soleright which fighting nations possessed with regard to neutrals was tovisit and search their ships in order to discover whether or not theywere carrying contraband and if so to bring them into port where acourt would adjudge them guilty or not guilty[Illustration A German Submarine awashPhoto Central News]Of course the German submarines could not completely blockade thecoasts of the British Isles nor could they take into port the shipswhich they stopped and searched In the latter case they might bejustified in sinking the ships but they would be guilty of crime ifthey did not save the crews and passengers A submarine cannot possiblytake off the crews of merchant vessels for it has no accommodation forthem Von Tirpitzs plan was piracy and nothing else In order to findan excuse the Germans declared that all the wheat and flour coming intoGermany from abroad belonged to the Government The British now seizedthe cargoes of ships thus laden because they were the property of anenemy Government Then the Germans began to call heaven and earth towitness that Great Britain was trying to starve German women andchildren Horrible pictures were painted of innocent people perishing ofhunger A German newspaper put the enemys view in a nutshell when itsaid England wants to employ every means to shorten the war Thenumber of lives that would be lost if she could starve Germany isnothing to her    Whether we wish it or not we must seek to destroyEnglands lifenervenamely her merchant shipping How she attemptedto do this we shall read in the next chapter  CHAPTER XI  THE SINKING OF THE LUSITANIAThe Germans were quite right in speaking of our mercantile marine as ourlifenerve In 1913 we had nearly 39600 merchant vessels with atonnage of more than 14000000 tons You will get some idea of thevastness of our overseas trade when I tell you that the tonnage of shipsowned in Liverpool alone exceeds that of the German Empire On anaverage about 1400 merchant vessels enter and leave our ports everyweek This means that the submarines which were now going to destroy ourlifenerve were presented with about two hundred targets a dayYou must not suppose that the Germans waited until 18th February tobegin their attacks on our merchant vessels Early in February theGerman submarine U21 appeared in the Irish Sea and proceeded to sinkthree small ships On the same day other enemy submarines sank ships inthe English Channel one of them the Toko Maru being laden withmutton stores and clothing for Belgian refugees Between Pirate Day18th February and 11th April fiftyeight ships were attacked most ofwhich were sent to the bottom Neutral as well as British ships weresunk by the submarines several of them without warning Sometimes theofficers gave ten minutes grace to allow passengers and crews to taketo the boats but in other cases the ships were sunk at sight and morethan once shells were fired at men in the boats who were trying torescue their comrades struggling in the water Frequently fast steamersescaped and more than one vessel charged down on the attackingsubmarine The Thordis for example crashed at full speed into thesubmarine which threatened her off Beachy Head and sent it to thebottomOn 1st March Great Britain declared a blockade of Germany By this timeit was apparent that as a means of reducing our food supply orweakening our determination to continue the war Germanys submarineblockade had proved to be a failure Between 18th February and themiddle of August less than one and a half per cent of our ships weresunk and we went on our way quite unmoved Neutral countries howeversaw clearly what Germanys command of the sea would mean to them TheAmerican nation was soon to be roused to the highest pitch ofindignation by one of the foulest crimes ever committedAlready four American ships had been destroyed by the Germans andseveral American citizens had been drowned On 27th March the Britishsteamer Falaba was sunk off the Pembrokeshire coast with a loss of 112lives including that of an American The Germans did not wait until allthe boats had been lowered before firing a torpedo into the steamersside and then not content with sending so many helpless people totheir doom they watched them struggling in the icy waters withoutlifting a hand to help them It is even said that they mocked and jeeredat the drowning men and women This is not war it is murder said theNew York Times This crime however was soon to be outdoneOn May 7 1915 the Cunard liner Lusitania was steaming a few milessouthwest of the old Head of Kinsale on her homeward voyage toLiverpool She was one of the largest and finest liners afloat She wastotally unarmed and she carried passengers and crew to the number of1906 many of them being citizens of the United States Before she leftNew York her passengers had been warned that the Germans meant to sinkher Nobody however dreamed that even Germans could descend to suchdepths of infamyAs the Lusitania approached the Irish coast she received a messagefrom the Admiralty warning her that German submarines were in theneighbourhood She had reduced her speed to eighteen knots so as not toarrive at the Mersey bar before the tide was high enough to enable herto cross An artist who was saved thus described what happened    The voyage from New York to London was made in excellent    weather The sun shone all the way and on the afternoon of the    disaster a golden sun lit up a beautifully blue calm sea I    think I can say that I was one of the four people who really saw    the torpedo discharged at the Lusitania I was in the    diningroom about 215 and had just finished luncheon I went    out and leaned against the starboard side of the vessel just    outside the palm lounge I saw the periscope of a submarine    about 200 yards away Then I noticed a long white streak of    foam It gave me the impression of a frothy fizzing in the    water A lady and two gentlemen came up to me and exclaimed Is    that a torpedo I felt too sick to answer and turned away    Almost immediately there was a terrific impact followed by the    explosion   Steam and smoke came up between the two last funnels and almostimmediately there was a second report probably due to the bursting ofthe main steam pipe I at once gave the order said Captain Turner atthe inquest to lower the boats down to the rails and I directed thatthe women and children should be got into them The moment the vesselwas struck she listed to starboard I stood on the bridge as she sankand the Lusitania went down under me She floated about eighteenminutes after the torpedo struck her An English passenger thusdescribed the scene as the Lusitania sank    Nearly a score of the boats on the port side were filled with    passengers but it was found impossible to lower them owing to    that side of the ship standing so high above the water I    managed to get across to starboard The ships deck was then    level with the sea I made for a boat which was just putting    off and in fact had one foot on the craft and the other on    the ship Then owing to something going wrong the lifeboat    jammed and all the occupants were thrown into the water It was    a terrible moment The passengers in the boat including women    screamed with terror and soon sank Other boats collapsed or    turned over and hundreds of people men women and children    were struggling helplessly in the water some clinging to boats    which had been upset I struck out and managed after swimming    for about fifteen minutes to come across a boat into which I    was dragged Hundreds of people were on rafts and the sea was    alive with men and womenThere was no ship of any kind in sight when the Lusitania wastorpedoed except a Peel trawler which was lying inshore She started atonce to the rescue but the wind was light and she was slow inarriving Nevertheless she managed to pick up over a hundred personsfrom lifeboats or rafts So crowded was the trawler with rescued peoplethat some had to sit with their legs dangling over the side Othertrawlers and boats from Kinsale came to the rescue and later on theIndian Prince a steamer from Queenstown arrived and began to pickup survivors When the deathroll was finally made up it was discoveredthat 1134 persons had been killed by the explosion or drowned Over ahundred American citizens went down that day[Illustration On the Face of the Watersafter the Sinking of theLusitaniaBy permission of the Illustrated London NewsWe can never know all the acts of heroism and selfsacrifice which wereperformed when the passengers and crew of the Lusitania werestruggling for life in the water but we know that Mr Vanderbilt theAmerican millionaire though unable to swim gave his lifebelt to awoman and remained steadfastly on the deck awaiting his end One of thedrowned sailors was found with a little child strapped to his back andno doubt its weight cost the swimmer his life]No incident of the war provoked more terrible indignation against theHuns It is said that two wealthy American citizens who were saved in alifeboat stood up amidst the scene of horror and pledged themselvesthat if the United States did not go to war with Germany within sevendays they would forswear their country for ever The news was receivedwith bitter anger in Great Britain and in New York there was a hush ofhorror broken only by the sniggers of GermanAmericans A coronersjury which sat at Kinsale brought in a verdict of wilful murder againstthe Emperor of Germany and his Government Remember the Lusitaniabecame a watchword at recruiting meetings and thousands of men flockedto the colours eager to avenge this foul and cowardly crimeAmerica had declared that she would hold Germany to strict account forevery American life lost as a result of the submarine blockade Sevendays after the sinking of the Lusitania President Wilson sent a verycalm and moderate Note to Germany declaring that American citizens hadthe right to travel wherever their business called them on the highseas without their lives being endangered by warships and that theirGovernment would do everything to maintain this right At the same timethe Note suggested that the sinking of American ships and theLusitania was due to mistakes on the part of the commanders ofsubmarines and it called upon the German Government to disavow theseacts and prevent them from taking place in the future Germany repliedin a shuffling fashion and on 21st July President Wilson sent anotherNote which practically threatened war if the Germans did not cease theirblockadeHow did Germany reply to this Note On 19th August one of hersubmarines without warning torpedoed the White Star liner Arabic offCape Clear The loss of life was small for the vessel remained afloatfor ten minutes and there was time to lower the boats When it becameknown that the Arabic had twentysix American citizens on board angerflamed up anew The wrath of Americans was raised almost to war pitchespecially when the Germans put forward a series of falsehoods inexcuse The German Minister at Washington now saw that his Governmenthad gone too far He begged the United States Government to wait for areport and a little later he promised that full amends should be madeOn 1st September he gave a written pledge that thenceforward passengerliners would not be sunk by submarines without warning and withoutensuring the safety of the lives of those on board provided that theliners did not try to escape or show fight He also declared thatGermany had decided to make this change in her policy before the sinkingof the ArabicThe Americans were delighted with this very doubtful promise and theybelieved that they had forced Germany to give up the worst features ofthe blockade If you read the promise carefully you will see that theGermans had so worded it that they could still proceed in the old way Asubmarine might give passengers time to get into small boats inmidocean but how could it ensure their safety There was a case duringthe blockade of men who had escaped in a boat being afloat for fourdays without food and water and some of them dying from exposure Thenagain the promise only applied to passenger liners and not to merchantships It was quite easy for a submarine commander to sink a liner andthen pretend that it had resisted or tried to escape Above all nothingwas said about the right of Americans to sail the seas without theirlives being endangered by warships Nevertheless the Americans weredelighted with the promise and plumed themselves greatly on having donea great service to mankindThree days later came a rude awakening On the night of 4th Septemberthe Allan liner Hesperian was torpedoed by a German submarine withoutwarning The liner was then 130 miles west of Queenstown She keptafloat for some time and was towed towards port but went down at sevenoclock on the morning of 6th September There was a small loss of lifeand there were two Americans on board It was now clear to everybodythat the German promise was a mere scrap of paper Wrath surged upagain in the United States but it led to nothing The Germansuntruthfully declared that the vessel was sunk by a mine and not by asubmarineDuring the last three weeks of August and the first week of Septemberships of all sorts were sunk at the rate of about sixteen a week Thencame a rapid falling off and during the week ending 10th October onlytwo ships were sent to the bottom The submarine blockade was fizzlingout The Germans had changed their policy not because of the protestsof the Americans but because they had discovered that the game was notworth the candle Mr Balfour in a letter to a correspondent gave thetrue reason why the Germans were bringing the blockade to an end Hesaid that while the losses of German submarines had been very great theBritish merchant navy was stronger than when the blockade began Thoughmany innocent persons women and children as well as men had beenrobbed and killed the criminals had paid a heavy toll The reason whythe Germans had changed their policy was not because the United Stateshad protested not because the Germans had revolted against lawlesscruelty No The reason is to be found elsewhere It is to be found inthe fact that the authors of the submarine policy have had time tomeasure its effects and that deeds which were merely crimes in May inSeptember were seen to be blundersBy the month of June the British navy had learnt the art of capturingthe submarines of the enemy and so expert had it become in this workthat a U boat once discovered had but little chance of escapeSubmarinehunting became the great sport of the navy and every youngofficer and bluejacket was eager to engage in it We do not know howmany German submarines were destroyed but we were informed throughAmerica that seventyeight of them had been seized or sunk and that inDecember 1915 at least five of the Kaisers submarines manned byBritish seamen were doing splendid work against his ships in theBaltic The British only rarely announced their successes and theGerman submarine crews were always in doubt as to the fate of theirfellows Before long their nerve failed them and even at the beginningof their voyages they were disheartened and hopelessThe methods by which the enemys submarines were captured or destroyedwere not revealed but we know that fast motor boats each armed with apowerful gun were employed in the hunt and that steel nets weresometimes used When a big fish was caught the floats of the nets gavewarning and destroyers promptly arrived to deal with itInnocentlooking patrol boats were sometimes attacked and too latethe biter discovered that he was bitten There is a story that asubmarine commander approaching one of these patrols called out Igive you ten minutes to take to your boats whereupon the skipperwhipping a concealed gun round and preparing to fire returned answerAnd I give you three minutes to go to the bottomNo submarine loss caused such bitter chagrin in Germany as the sinkingof the famous U29 late in March You will remember that it was this boatwhich had sunk the Hogue Cressy Aboukir and Hawke CaptainWeddigen who commanded U29 had become a popular hero in Germany andthe Kaiser had showered honours on him He was a good type of sailorboth skilful and brave and it is to his credit that he was known inthis country as the polite pirate He not only expressed his regret athaving to sink merchant ships but gave food and comforts to theircrews and towed their boats some distance towards the land When it wasknown that Weddigen had gone down with all his crew in U29 the Germansput forth an absurd story that the submarine had been sunk while she wasengaged in lifesaving and was unable to defend herself One Germannewspaper demanded revenge for Weddigen and declared that no moresacrifices must be made to the German system of humanity in war                           I will conclude this chapter with a brief account of the troubles andtrials which the Americans had to endure because of the attempts ofGerman agents to stir up all sorts of strife in their country Almostfrom the beginning of the year there were explosions and fires in thefactories which were making munitions for the Allies and there waslittle doubt that these outrages which frequently led to loss of lifewere the work of German hirelings During August the New York Worldpublished evidence proving that German money was lavished amongstnewspapers for the purpose of getting them to publish articles in favourof Germany It also proved that men were paid to bring about strikes inengineering shops to blow up ships laden with munitions and tointerfere in every possible way with American affairs so as to causetrouble between Britain and the United StatesOn 6th September matters came to a head Papers taken from an Americanjournalist at Falmouth showed that Dr Dumba the AustroHungarianambassador was at the bottom of a series of attempts to preventfactories from making munitions for the Allies and to stir up Americanexporters against Britain Amongst these papers was a private letterfrom Captain von Papen a German soldier attached to the German EmbassyIn it he spoke of these idiotic Yankees The Americans were indignantat these exposures and insults and the Government demanded that DrDumba should be recalled He was handed his passports and he leftAmericafor Americas goodOn 10th November the Italian liner Ancona bound from Naples to NewYork was fired at and torpedoed in the Mediterranean Sea by two largesubmarines probably German but carrying the Austrian flag Some 500persons were on board and only some 260 were saved Amongst those whoperished were about 20 American citizens At once President Wilson senta sharp Note demanding that Austria should disavow the crime punishthe captains of the submarines and promise to safeguard Americanpassengers in the future To this Note Austria replied in a very defiantfashion and by so doing again strained the patience of the Americanpeople almost to the breaking point At the close it looked as thoughAmerica was about to break off all relations with AustriaIn December the German Government was obliged to recall Captain vonPapen and another member of the Embassy These two men had set theAmerican Government at defiance and had encouraged plots throughout thelength and breadth of the country Some of their agents were brought totrial and were punished and President Wilson announced that the menwho were plotting to destroy property and to undermine the Governmentmust be crushed out Thus at the close of the year America seemed tobe ready to put an end to the German mischiefmakers who had done somuch to disturb the peace of the country and to foster lawlessness andstrife[Illustration A German Submarine half submerged]  CHAPTER XII  STORIES OF SUBMARINES  Well duck and well dive like little tin turtles   Well duck and well dive beneath the North Seas   Until we strike something that doesnt expect us   From here to Cuxhaven its go as you please      Rudyard KiplingI have told you in these pages of many daring deeds and narrow escapeson the battlefield but for exploits which really thrill us and make ushold our breath we must go to the men who fight in the air or under thesea Jules Verne never imagined anything half so marvellous as theirdoings When the war is over we shall hear stories of aviators and ofthe crews of submarines which will make the wildest inventions ofwriters of adventure seem tame and colourlessThe business of the submarines says Mr Kipling is to run monstrousrisks from the earth air and water in what to be of any use must bethe coldest of blood Submarine officers he continues play hourlyfor each others lives with Death the umpire always at their elbow ontiptoe to give them out And consider the bowling and fielding inthis nightmare game where there is rarely a second innings A bomb froma Zeppelin or an aeroplane a shot from a 4inch gun a bump against amine a collision with a reef or the bows of a destroyer trawler ortramp an accident to the complicated gearand all is overNevertheless the officers and crews of submarines soon lose the senseof imminent peril and go about their business quite unconcerned                           The following story shows how a submarine was trapped but managed tofree herself and turn the tables on her enemy A British boat which wascruising under water in the North Sea ran her nose into a net andbecame entangled She rose to the surface meaning to cut away the netand get clear No sooner did her conning tower appear above the waterthan her commander saw a Zeppelin hovering right above him and in amoment a bomb plumped into the sea unpleasantly near He had noalternative but to go below again but this he had to do as gingerly aspossible for otherwise the submarine would have wrapped herself up inthe net still more Steadily she sank and by slow working and wrigglingmanaged to get clear of the entanglement Then she lay on the bottomand her commander began to think out the next move in the perilous gameShould he go back to warn the other submarines or should he wait andtry to bag something He knew that the Zeppelin believed him to beentangled in the net and that it was sure to signal for destroyers tocome and finish him off so he sat tight and waited In a few minutes heheard the screws of the destroyers churning above him Then he rose andat the critical moment gave the signal to let loose a torpedo The shotwent home the destroyer crumpled up and was taken in tow by a consortUnhappily as the commander had no more torpedoes he was balked of asecond victim                           Since the war began British submarines have penetrated into everyharbour and river mouth on the coast of Germany One day a British boatin the mouth of a German river was seen by the enemy At once she wentunder but though she lay on the silt at the bottom she had not morethan five feet of water above her Almost any patrol boat could have hither and destroyed her had her whereabouts been known but somehow theGermans missed her They meant to catch her however and began to sweepthe river with a wire trawl Before long the commander of the submarineheard the trawl rasping along his hull He sat and listened expectingevery moment that it would catch on something and reveal him to theGermans working above The suspense was enough to turn a mans hairgray Happily the trawl slid off the hull and the danger passed Atnightfall the submarine made her way into the open sea and finallyreached harbour safely                           The following story has been told of a fight between a British submarineand a Zeppelin One day a boat came to the surface and found herselfright underneath a Zeppelin that was flying only a few yards above thesea The commander could not see the sky only the shining bulge of theairship Luckily he was not under the stinging end of the monsterImmediately he sank till his decks were awash and went away towindward so that the Zeppelin had to follow him with the wind in itsteeth Then he sent a man to the gun on deck The waves were washingover the submarine and the man was nearly drowned but he hung on andwhenever he saw a chance fired a shot at the airship which by thistime was dropping bombs One of his shots got home and the Zeppelin wasobliged to steer to leeward and give up the chase A fortnight later shewas seen with a patch on the place where she had been hit                           On page 283 of our third volume I told you how Lieutenant Holbrook wonthe Victoria Cross for conspicuous bravery while in command of asubmarine which was scouting in the Dardanelles during December 1914 Inthese narrow waters and in the Sea of Marmora some extraordinary featswere performed by our submarines during the year 1915 An Americancorrespondent tells us that our underwater boats created a reign ofterror amongst the peasants and villagers living on the shores of thatsea Turkish warships and gunboats and large numbers of transports andsupply ships were sunk and navigation was almost entirely suspended OnApril 27 1915 Submarine E14 dived under the enemy mine fields andentered the Sea of Marmora In spite of strong currents the presence ofhostile patrols and the hourly danger of attack from the enemy shesucceeded in sinking two Turkish gunboats and two transports one ofthem large and full of troops and after cruising in the enemys watersfor twentytwo days returned in safety For this remarkable exploitwhich the admiral at the Dardanelles declared himself unable to dojustice to LieutenantCommander Edward Courtney Boyle received theVictoria CrossLate in May the British submarine E11 had an extraordinary bag Shesucceeded in destroying one large Turkish gunboat two transports oneammunition ship and three storeships and drove another storeshipashore Then she passed through the minefield on her homeward way buton sighting another Turkish transport returned and managed to torpedoit In the course of her cruise she entered the Golden Horn andactually discharged a torpedo at a transport lying alongside thearsenal The Turks declared that the torpedo struck the quay and blew uptwo hundred yards of masonry LieutenantCommander Martin Eric Nasmithwho was the heart and soul of these intrepid feats was rightly awardedthe highest token of valour                           Getting into and out of the Sea of Marmora is a terribly difficultbusiness as the Narrows[18] through which all ships must pass wasstrewn with mines the shores were studded with batteries and concealedtorpedo tubes Lieutenant Holbrook you will remember had to dive underfive rows of mines before he could torpedo the Turkish battleshipMessudiyeh Mr Kipling tells us that one boat went down the straitsand found herself rather canted over to one side A mine and chain hadjammed under her forward divingplane So far as I made out she shookit off by standing on her head and jerking backwards or it may havebeen for the thing has occurred more than once she merely rose as muchas she could when she could and then released it by hand as theofficial phrase goes[Illustration Lieutenant Guy DOyly Hughes starting off with his RaftPhoto Central News]Perhaps the most thrilling feat of daring ever associated with submarinewarfare was performed by Lieutenant Guy DOyly Hughes on August 211915 Lieutenant Hughes had already distinguished himself during theoperations of E11 which I have described above He volunteered to make asinglehanded attempt to blow up a Turkish railway A raft was preparedand on it were placed the charge his clothes a revolver a bayonetand an electric torch Round his neck he carried a whistle Towardsdusk the submarine ventured within sixty yards of the land and thenLieutenant Hughes stripped to the skin went overboard and pushing hisraft before him swam to the shore When he touched bottom he found thatthe cliffs were too high to scale He therefore started off again andswam along the shore until he reached a less precipitous landingplaceHaving dressed he clambered up the rocks carrying his charge with himAfter a stiff climb he reached the top of the cliffs and proceedingwith great caution made his way to the railway line which he followedtowards a viaductHe had only advanced about five or six hundred yards when he heardvoices and shortly afterwards caught a glimpse of three Turkishsoldiers sitting by the side of the line and talking loudly Afterwatching them for some time he decided to leave the charge which washeavy and cumbersome and make a wide circuit inland so as to get tothe viaduct unseen This he did the only incident by the way being anunfortunate fall from a wall into a farmyard where his suddenappearance startled the poultry and disturbed the household He was nothowever detected When he came in sight of the viaduct he found that itwas guarded A fire was burning at one end of it and there were menclose at hand It was impossible to destroy the viaduct so he returnedto the place from which he had started picked up his charge revolverbayonet and electric torch and looked for a spot where he might do asmuch damage as possible to the lineSearching about he found a low brickwork support over a small hollowand there he placed his charge He was only 150 yards from the threesoldiers who were still sitting by the line He muffled the fuse pistolas tightly as possible with a piece of rag but when he pulled it thenoise was sufficiently loud to be heard by the soldiers who stood uplooked around them and catching sight of the lieutenant ran towardshim He fired two shots at them but missed and hotly pursued beat ahasty retreat along the line to the eastward A few shots were fired athim but he was not hit and after running about a mile he found himselfclose to the shoreAt once without discarding his clothes he plunged into the water andas he did so the charge exploded Fragments of brick and earth fellaround him and even near the submarine which was then in a small baybehind the cliffs about six hundred yards from the shore After swimmingfor four or five hundred yards the lieutenant blew a long blast on hiswhistle but the submarine did not hear it Day was now rapidlybreaking so he turned back to the shore and rested for a short timeThen he threw away his revolver bayonet and electric torch andentering the water once more swam towards the bay in which thesubmarine was lying Not until he had rounded the last point was hiswhistle heardAs his comrades prepared to come to his assistance he heard shouts fromthe cliffs above and saw Turkish soldiers firing on the submarinewhich now came out of the bay stern first In the morning mist hemistook the bow the gun and the conning tower for three small rowingboats Thinking that these boats were manned by his enemies he swamashore again and began to climb up to a hollow of the cliffs somedistance above him He had not climbed more than a few feet before hesaw the submarine realized his mistake and began shouting to hiscomrades Once more he entered the water and about forty yards from therocks was picked up in an exhausted condition He had swum the best partof a mile in his clothesThus happily ended Lieutenant Hughess daring adventure I think youwill agree with me that as a story of pluck endurance and resource itis hard to beat[Footnote 18 The narrowest part of the Dardanelles 14 miles from theMediterranean The width of the strait at the Narrows is aboutthreequarters of a mile]  CHAPTER XIII  MORE STORIES OF SUBMARINE WARFAREYou must not suppose that our submarines carried out their raids in theDardanelles and in the Sea of Marmora without loss Several of ourunderwater boats came to grief E15 for example while trying totorpedo a Turkish ship at the Narrows[19] ran ashore on the Asiaticside She was undamaged and a Turkish destroyer speedily appeared onthe scene The admiral on the station was anxious that she should notfall into the enemys hands so he gave orders that she was to bedestroyed The story of how she was finally blown up is worth tellingFive different methods of destroying her were tried but all in vainAeroplanes endeavoured to drop bombs on her but without successsubmarines tried to torpedo her but failed destroyers attempted tosink her but could not manage to do so and two battleships fired ather but did not hit her The battleships aimed their turret guns from adistance of 5 miles and found that the conning tower of the submarinewas too small a target As a last resort the admiral gave the followingorder Two picket boats from Triumph and Majestic are to attack E15tonight April 18 with torpedoes fitted to dropping gear    Onlyvolunteer crews to be sentAn officer in charge of the Triumphs boat tells us[20] that he wasjoined by the boat from the Majestic at 10 pmWe steamed about eight knots as the current was strong and until wereached the beginning of the dangerous area we chattedto keep up ourcourage perhaps As a matter of fact I wasnt in much of a funk andfelt fairly cool for I have been under fire a good many times and Irecognized that I had got a chance that does not often come in a manslife It was a bit eerie though steaming along in the pitch dark withall lights out in the boat towards the distant searchlights notknowing whether death or life awaited us   We kept nearly in the centre of the channel to avoid being spotted bythe No 7 searchlight which was not a very high one We had come alongquite unobserved until we were abeam of it passing the smallersearchlights without much trouble Unfortunately the men stationed nearthe No 7 searchlight saw us and started firing 6 or 12 poundershrapnel at usThus the ball opened We still had three to four miles to go Wecontinued our way and approached the other searchlights The alarmhaving been given all the other searchlights came on and sent theirbeams searching round to pick us up and as each beam struck us bangwould go another gun A few seconds later we would hear a ping as theprojectile whizzed past us or a sharp metallic crack as a shrapnelburst just over our headsBy the time they arrived near the stranded submarine eight searchlightswere trained on them and guns were firing at them from six differentpoints Presently they saw a dark mass which they thought to be thesubmarine and fired a torpedo at it but missed[Illustration The End of a SubmarineThe cruiser has fired at the submarine and hit her but to makeassurance doubly sure is now crashing down upon her at full speed]Suddenly we saw the Majestics boat in trouble and the crew callingfor help It appeared that coming up behind us and whilst thesearchlights were focussed on us one of the beams passed us and shoneright on E15 and the Majestics boat was luckily only two hundredyards away and saw it Lieutenant Godwin immediately fired one torpedowhich did not strike the object At that moment his boat was struck by ashell under the waterline aft and commenced to take in water rapidlyHe gallantly turned his boat towards E15 again steamed in a bit andfired his second torpedo which caught E15 just in front of the conningtower and on the forward whaleback of the hull making a fineexplosion I consider this was a very brave deed as Godwin knew he wasin imminent danger of sinking but ran in again to have a second shotWhen we saw them their sternsheets were awash and it looked as ifthey might have to swim for it We manoeuvred the boat to go alongsidebut the current was terrible and it made the handling a very difficultmatter The enemy saw the disaster and redoubled their efforts The seaall round us was a mass of splashes from projectiles some of themfifteen to twenty feet high whilst the water where the shrapnel burstwas pitted as if by heavy rain How it was we were not hit I cannot sayone would imagine it was impossible to come out of such a hail aliveAll I can say is that God preserved us and not a shot actually hit usthough we were one and all wet with the splashesAs we steamed round again before heading out we saw a man crawling outof the other boats sternsheets He had been forgotten in the hurry ofthe moment It looked like suicide to go back but of course we couldnot leave him there so manoeuvred close again and shouted to him to getinto the water and swim towards us which he did and we hauled him intothe boat unconscious   By this time we thought we had better clear out so turned our nosetowards home and steamed away at half speed still under heavy fire Wedid not like to go full speed as we thought it would shake up thewounded man too muchThe officer who relates the story tells us that when he reached theMajestic the commander with the true old Navy touch instead ofcongratulating us on the success of the expedition and our people ontheir lives being saved only asked them if they had saved any of theboats gear Congratulations however came later when theViceAdmiral signalled that he had read with much pride the report ofthe torpedo attack on the wreck of E15 and that he considered theservice which had been rendered of the greatest value                           During the early months of the war the Baltic Sea was Germanys owndomain Her merchant vessels went to and fro across its waters withoutmolestation from the British By July 1915 however our submarines hadgot through the dangerous channels and were busily engaged indestroying German shipping It was no easy matter for our submarines toenter the Baltic The Germans had laid mines in the narrow waters bywhich alone entrance could be gained and had established a patrolservice They felt sure that they could keep out the British submarinesbut they had underestimated British skill courage and caution Fromthat time onward German vessels were sunk at the rate of about two aday A battleship and at least two cruisers were sunk before the end ofNovember and a state of panic reigned It was allimportant that theGermans should maintain sea communication with Sweden from which theydrew vast quantities of iron ore and other raw materials and also withDenmark You can imagine their consternation when they found that noneof their merchant ships dare leave port without the risk of being sentto the bottom I need not tell you that in every case the British weremost careful to save the lives of the crews                           One of the most successful of our submarine officers was Commander MaxK Horton He was present during the Battle of Heligoland Bight and youhave already read page 168 Vol II how on September 13 1915 hesank the light cruiser Hela and was playfully dubbed by his comradesThe Doubletoothed Pirate The next day at great risk he examinedthe outer anchorage of Heligoland and on 6th October sank a Germandestroyer off the mouth of the Ems When or how he got into the BalticSea we do not know but we do know that on July 2 1915 he torpedoedthe German battleship Pommern and that shortly afterwards the Tsarrecognized this important service by conferring on him the Order of StGeorge At the same time the cross of the same order was awarded to themembers of his crew During the Battle of the Gulf of Riga which Ishall describe in a later chapter Commander Noel Laurence torpedoed theGerman cruiser Moltke which you will remember took part in the EastCoast raids and in the Battle of the Dogger Bank She was badlydisabled and was towed away probably towards Kiel The Tsar awardedCommander Laurence and his crew similar distinctions to those conferredupon Commander Max Horton and his comrades                           One of our submarines E13 ran aground early in the morning of 19thAugust on the Danish island of Saltholm which lies in the Sound betweenCopenhagen and the Swedish town of Malm At 5 am a Danish torpedoboat saw her and signalled to her that she would be allowed twentyfourhours in which to try to get off At the same time a German destroyerarrived and remained close to the submarine until two other Danishtorpedo boats came up when she withdrew The submarine you mustremember was in Danish waters and if the Germans should attack herthey would commit an act of war against Denmark which as you know isneutral Nevertheless at 9 am two German destroyers appearedlaunched a torpedo at the submarine and fired at her with all theirguns The British commander ordered his men to abandon the vessel butwhile they were doing so machine guns were turned on them and shrapnelwas burst above them Fourteen of the poor fellows were killed and nota soul of the crew would have remained alive had not a Danish torpedoboat gallantly steamed in between the submarine and the Germandestroyer and thus covered the stranded vessel This cowardly andmurderous act caused great indignation not only in Britain but inDenmark Once more German sailors had covered themselves with infamy                           Russian submarines were also active in the Baltic The following storytells us how a Russian submarine collided with a German warship whichshe had just torpedoedHaving picked up the smoke of enemy vessels on the horizon thesubmarine approached them and by means of her periscope discovered thatthey consisted of ten ships of the line and several torpedo boats Toprevent the enemy from seeing his periscope the commander of thesubmarine steered to the port side of the squadron where he was betweenthe ships and the light With his periscope six inches above the waterhe approached the squadron and then dived When he rose again hesighted on his starboard the ram of the leading warship which wascutting across his course at a distance of not more than sixty yardsAgain he dived and gave the order to fire a torpedo The order wasobeyed and was immediately followed by a collision A terrible crashwas heard The whole submarine trembled the electric bulbs burstcrockery and all kinds of articles flew about something above crackedbroke and gave way The submarine took a list to starboard and thecrew were unable to keep their feet What had happened The hull of thewarship had struck the centre of the submarine The men hung on toanything within reach and fortunately kept their heads Full speedahead was the order and soon the submarine regained her balanceShe was 75 feet below the surface when a loud explosion was heard Thetorpedo had got home The noise was so great that the commander thoughtthe shell of his boat had been damaged by the collision and that it wascollapsing under the pressure of the water He therefore rose to 60feet but the sound of the approaching screw of a large ship forced himto dive to 80 feet Again and again he tried to rise but every time heheard the screws of battleships and torpedo boats above him He nowdiscovered that his periscope was damaged and that his boat was leakingand losing its buoyancy Water had to be blown out of the tanks fromtime to time and this revealed the presence of the submarine to theships above It was not until near midnight that she dared come to thesurface She rose carefully and thanks to the darkness was not seenSoon she was making her way to the shore having been under water forfour hours without a break                           About the second week of May German submarines were reported in theMediterranean During the month of February the Germans completed thefirst of their big submarines which were capable of making the journeyfrom Zeebrugge to the Dardanelles within three weeks Secret bases hadbeen established in Eastern waters and the British Government offered alarge reward for their discovery Several of them were found on Greekislands Before long the German submarines made their presence felt Weshall learn in a later chapter how on 26th May one of them managed totorpedo the Triumph and the next day sent the Majestic to thebottom The submarines practically put an end to the bombardment of theDardanelles forts by our ships of war While firing at the forts theships were obliged to move slowly and thus were at the mercy of anenemy under waterGermanys new submarines in the Mediterranean mounted bigger and moreeffective guns than had formerly been employed on underwater craft andthey were able to destroy several vessels by shell fire Not onlyBritish French and Italian vessels were sent to the bottom but one ifnot two American ships I have already told you of the sinking of theAncona Dastardly as it was it was outdone on 30th December when thePeninsular and Oriental liner Persia was sent to her doom She was onher outward voyage and at lunch time was off the island of Crete whenwithout warning of any kind a torpedo was launched against her Fiveminutes after she received her deathblow she had vanished utterly Morethan 330 out of the 501 passengers and crew were lost and amongst thevictims were a large number of women and children Lord Montagu who wassaved cabled home as follows    I have had a miraculous escape The ship sank by the stern    dragging me down with her When I was blown up to the surface    again I saw a dreadful scene of struggling human beings There    was hardly any wreckage to grasp Nearly all the boats were    smashed and only three remained afloat After a desperate    struggle I climbed on the bottom of a broken boat with 28    Lascars and three other Europeans Our number was reduced to 19    by Thursday night and only 11 remained on Friday the rest    having died from exposure and injuries We saw a neutral steamer    pass close by on Thursday evening at about 8 oclock but she    took no notice of the red flare shown by another of the    Persias boats We saw a large steamer three miles away on the    next day but she too ignored our signals probably thinking    they were a ruse of an enemy submarine Our broken boat capsized    constantly and we were all the time washed by the waves so    that we were almost exhausted when the second night began At    830 pm we saw the Alfred Holt steamer Ningchow near us and    shouted as loudly as we could On Friday night at 9 oclock she    rescued us We had been thirtytwo hours in the sea without    water or food except one biscuit since breakfast time on    ThursdayWithin a day or two of this outrage the British steamer Glengyle wasalso sunk in the Mediterranean but happily all the passengers weresaved In the North Sea we had got the submarine danger well in handbut in the far more extensive Mediterranean the enemy remained powerfulfor mischief down to the close of the year[Footnote 19 For an account of the Narrows see Chapter XX][Footnote 20 Blackwoods Magazine October 1915]  CHAPTER XIV  WINTER FIGHTING IN POLAND AND EAST PRUSSIAIn chapter XXIX of our third volume I told you how von Hindenburgssecond attempt on Warsaw was foiled and how the Russians during thelast days of December 1914 stood firm on a front of great strength Atthe beginning of the year 1915 the Russian front extended from theBaltic Sea right to the border of Rumaniaa distance of at least ninehundred miles In January 1915 the Russians were holding the longestbattle front ever known in the history of the worldWe may divide this very extended battle front as Csar dividedGaulinto three parts The trenches in the central or Polish zone ranfrom the mouth of the Bzura on the Middle Vistula to the UpperVistula at its confluence with the Donajetz in a fairly straight linefor a distance of about two hundred miles On either side of thiscentral zone there were two wings which differed greatly in characterBoth were bent back from the line of the central zone the north orright wing followed a sickle shape through a region of lake and marshfrom the Baltic to the Vistula and was for the most part within theEast Prussian frontier while the south or left wing ran from the UpperVistula to follow the line of the CarpathiansWe will now learn something of the fighting which took place in thefirst three months of the year 1915 on the north or right wing For thefirst few weeks there was ordinary trench warfare such as was going onin the West Attacks and counterattacks were frequent but there was noaction of any great importance Most of the attacks were made by nightbeneath the light of rockets and starshells and the glare ofsearchlights On the Bzura River the trenches of friend and foe wereonly sixty yards apart and in this section of the line the Germanstried a very ingenious method of breaking down the Russian wireentanglements They filled barrels with clay and rolled them down theslopes towards the Russians who believed that men with wirecutterswere hiding behind the barrels and pushing them forward They thereforeflung their hand grenades at the barrels only to discover that theywere moving by their own weight and that there were no men behind themWhen the Russians had thus exhausted their supply of hand grenades theGermans pushed forward and tried to rush the trenches They were onlybeaten off after a furious struggle Shells and bombs containing poisongases were also used by the Germans on this part of the lineIn Poland there was the same kind of warfare as on the Bzura Across theplains the Germans had made a maze of very strong trenches andearthworks with deep underground chambers floored and roofed with woodIn Galicia towards the end of January the bright sun melted the snowsof the Carpathians and the streams became roaring torrents which made avery effective barrier against surprise attacks Nevertheless the enemykept up a very heavy bombardment across the flooded waters On theDonajetz River the Austrians broke the rules of war and fired fromtheir machine guns explosive bullets which when they entered a mansbody blew away half his backTowards the end of January the Russians began to take the offensive onthe wings At this time you must remember the new forces which theAllies in the West had raised were not yet ready to take the field Thethin line of steel and valour in Artois and Flanders was only justholding its own and it was feared that if the Germans brought troopsfrom the East they would be able to break through the Allied line andreach the Channel ports The Grand Duke Nicholas was thereforerequested to attack von Hindenburg and prevent him from releasingtroops for service in the West Earlier in the war he had sacrificedlarge numbers of his men in East Prussia to give his Western Allies abreathing space Now although his forces were very weak in gunsrifles and ammunition he showed the same high courage and chivalry Heknew that if he pushed forward into the sacred land of East Prussiavon Hindenburg would hasten to engage him and that if he threatenedHungary the great granary of the Central Powers the enemy would bebound to oppose him The Grand Duke Nicholas was well aware that hecould not hope for conquest All that he could do would be to worry theenemy and prevent him from sending troops to the West[Illustration The Russians retaking a Trench before BolimovBy permission of The Illustrated London NewsThe following account of the incident pictured above was given by aRussian soldierThey did not stay long when we came down on them withour bayonets Our artillery had dropped many shells right in the trenchbefore we got there The machine guns played on us until the lastminute and we paused to fire at the gunners The few Germans who wereleft tried to drag the guns away with them but our men took them awayfrom them]In order to provide a sufficient force for these attacks the Russianshad to draw off men and guns from their centre Von Hindenburg knewthis and he therefore determined to make another effort to captureWarsaw by a frontal attack The fiftysixth birthday of the Kaiser wasdrawing near and what better present could be made to him than thegreat Polish capital You will remember that at this time the Russianswere lying along the right bank of the Bzura and its tributary theRawka Look at the map on the next page and find the town of Bolimov onthe western bank of the Rawka It is about forty miles from Warsaw andis connected with it by a fairly good road In front of Bolimov thereare rolling downs and belts of wood You will notice that the Russianlines cross the Rawka south of BolimovOn the last day of January von Mackensen who had brought up largenumbers of heavy guns all along the left bank of the Rawka began aterrific bombardment of the Russian lines This was done to puzzle theRussians and make them uncertain as to where the infantry attack was tobe made The Germans proposed to advance on a line of seven milesbetween Bolimov and the BzuraOn the night of 1st February when the snow was falling heavily theGerman guns fiercely shelled the Russian trenches between the Warsawroad and the Bzura River When it was supposed that the wireentanglements had been blown into a million fragments and the trenchesutterly wrecked 140000 Germans including Prussian Guards advanced inmasses sometimes ten and sometimes twentytwo deep They were mown downby Russian shot and shell nevertheless they carried the first line oftrenches and by the evening of the 2nd February had pushed the Russiansback to the crest of a ridge behind the town of Borzymov On Wednesdaythe Germans looked like succeeding but by means of the railways whichyou see to the north and to the south of Borzymov and also by means ofthe roads the Grand Duke hurried up reinforcements from Warsaw Theymarched through the driving snow and arrived on the scene of battlelate on Thursday By this time the Germans had been checked They hadpushed across the crest of the ridge behind Borzymov had advanced fivemiles along the railway and had very nearly broken through the Russianfront[Illustration The Battle on the Rawka]The fighting was terribly fierce and the Germans lost heavily AroundBorzymov the slaughter was so great that the ground was cumbered withGerman dead and the survivors used the bodies of their fallen comradesto build up defences The woods to the south of the BolimovWarsaw roadwere also strewn with dead By 8th February the Germans had been flungback to the banks of the Rawka and the Russians had crossed the riverat Dachova The German loss cannot have been less than 20000 men Thegreat attempt had failed and it was now clear that Warsaw could not becaptured by a frontal attackAs soon as von Hindenburg saw that the BzuraRawka lines were too strongfor him he was ready with a new plan He was now about to try a flankattack Look carefully at the map on the next page and notice therailways which meet in the Polish capital By these railways alone cana Russian army maintain itself westward of the Vistula In front of themain railway A A from Warsaw to Petrograd you see a river linethatof the Niemen and the Narev Von Hindenburgs plan was to push out fromEast Prussia carry the river line cut the railway and thus force theRussians to retire from Warsaw which would then fall into his handsMeanwhile the Austrians on the Russian left wing were to drive backBrussilov relieve Przemysl and try to recapture Lemberg If theseoperations should succeed the Russians would be forced back from theline of the Vistula to the river Bug and it would take them a yearsfighting to recover the lost groundFirst of all we will follow the fortunes of the East Prussian campaignWhile the fighting was proceeding on the Rawka the Russians whonumbered about 120000 were making headway in East Prussia Despite thekeen frost the icy winds and the deep snowdrifts they pushed back theweak German forces opposed to them until on 6th February their rightwas not far from Tilsit and their left rested on the town ofJohannisburg Nowhere were they less than twentyfive miles within theEast Prussian frontierOn 7th February von Hindenburg sprang his surprise upon the invaders Hesuddenly hurled 300000 men against the whole line which the Russianswere holding According to custom the German left wing made anoutflanking movement It was successful and the Russians holding thispart of the line were forced to retreat along the railway towards KovnoThe 20th Corps just to the south of it now had its right in the airand was obliged to retire In the forests and marshes north of Suwalkiit was broken up into parties of stragglers The remainder of theRussian line was also driven back but only after a stern struggle By15th February the Germans were on Russian soil and were moving towardsthe river line which screens the railway from Warsaw to Petrograd Theywere about to attack on the Niemen the Bobr and the Narev at one andthe same time If the river line should be forced the railway wouldsoon be reached and cutI have told you what happened in East Prussia in a few sentences butyou must not suppose that the Germans won easy victories The Russiansresisted desperately and many of them fought to the last cartridgeThough their losses were very heavy they performed a great feat inretreating seventy miles with a force three times as great hard on theirheels The Germans had a good railway system to help them in their EastPrussian advance but more than half of the Russian army had to retirethrough thick forests and drag heavy guns across a rough broken countrydeep in snow and without railways[Illustration Map to illustrate the German attack on the river line]The Kaiser sent the following message to his people Russianscrushingly defeated Our beloved East Prussia liberated from the enemyOur beautiful Mazurian land is waste Signed Wilhelm The Germansclaimed that they had captured 75000 prisoners and 300 guns but thiswas false The total Russian losses were perhaps 80 guns and 30000men[Illustration Austrian TrenchesPhoto Topical PressThis photograph gives a good idea of the way in which trenches areconstructed and manned It will be noticed that the front and reartrench communicate by means of a narrow cutting and that the trenchesare dug zigzag so that they cannot be enfiladed along the full length]  CHAPTER XV  A BATTLE OF THE MIDDLE AGESThe Russians had already prepared positions on the river line and by19th February they had occupied them and were waiting for the Germansto attack Next day the enemy launched forces against the Niemen aboutfourteen miles to the north of Grodno A thick belt of wood on the banksof the river screened them from view and some of them succeeded incrossing the river but could not emerge from the forests on the otherside Though the railway was less than ten miles away they were unableto reach itMeanwhile the fortress of Ossowietz on the Bobr was undergoing asecond siege You will remember that the Germans had tried to capture itin the previous September but had failed because the fortress standsamidst marshes and they could not find solid ground from which to firetheir big guns Again they failed though they used every possibledevice to bring about its downfall Every knuckle of hard soil on whicha howitzer could be placed was known to the garrison and they were ableto silence the big guns of the enemy before they could do much mischiefIt is said that the Germans lost 15000 dead in their attempts to stormthe fortressThus the attacks on the Niemen and the Bobr had come to nothing By thebeginning of March the Russians were advancing everywhere along the linefrom Kovno to the Narev and the Germans were slowly retiring towardsEast Prussia There was desperate fighting with the bayonet amidst themarshy woods near Augustovo where large captures were made of Germanguns supplies and prisoners By the middle of March the Germans werecovering the East Prussian frontier and were only ten miles withinRussian territory Meanwhile a great battle had been fought and lost onthe Narev                           Look carefully at the map on p 115 it shows you the country betweenthe East Prussian frontier and the Narev This river flows in a windingcourse through a district of marshes and heavy woods with here andthere a few ridges To the north of the river and to the east of thetown of Przasnysz[21] which stands midway between the frontier and theNarev there are some fairly high hills with patches of forest on theirsandy slopes The crossingplaces of the Narev are protected byfortified towns some of which you see marked by a star on the mapFind the town of Mlawa of which you have already heard On a frontstretching for some twentyfive miles to the northeast of that townand about a days march in front of the Prussian frontier railway theGermans massed two corps and on 22nd February began to advance in threecolumns The right travelled from Mlawa by the railway which you seemarked on the map the centre marched along the main highway towardsPrzasnysz and the left followed the valley of a little river towards aroad which enters the same town from the northeast There was only asingle Russian brigade in front of Przasnysz and it was easily drivenback On the 24th the Germans entered the town in which they seized anumber of guns and captured about half the brigade which had beendefending itOn the previous day another Russian advanced body which lay on a ridgenear the village of Vola to the south of Przasnysz had been attackedElsewhere the Germans were advancing without much difficulty but onthis ridge a violent battle raged and the Russians made a most heroicstand For thirtysix hours they held out and on the evening of the24th their reinforcements arrived Four columns of Russians had advancedon Przasnysz from the Narev line and the invaders were pressednorthward on three sides They were driven through the town inconfusion and on the 26th it was once more in Russian hands All thenext day the battle raged amongst the snowy ridges to the northeast andnorthwest of the town and by Sunday morning the enemy was in fullretreat for the frontier leaving 10000 prisoners behind him Thus thewhole attempt to capture Warsaw by a flank movement had failed[Illustration Scene of the Fighting round Przasnysz]The Battle of Przasnysz was more like a struggle of the Middle Ages thana modern battle The Russians short of arms and ammunition and theycould not supply all their trained men with rifles In this and in otherfights the Russians kept unarmed troops in the rear When the men withrifles fell the unarmed were sent forward to take up the weapons of thedead and wounded and then fling themselves on the foe Men rushed intothe firing line at Przasnysz with a sword bayonet in one hand and twobombs in the other They charged through rifle and machinegun fireuntil they were near enough to fling their bombs and then fellfuriously upon the enemy with cold steel utterly reckless of wounds anddeath The Germans could not stand against such an onset and fled Thusby sheer bodily might the Russians had flung back in rout a foe superiorto them in numbers and once more von Hindenburg found Warsaw beyond hisgrasp[Illustration The Retreat of the Austrians across the Uzsok PassBy permission of The SphereThis spirited drawing shows Russian cavalry driving the Austrians acrossthe snowbound Uzsok Pass See page 120 In this attack the Russiansfell upon the flank and rear of the Austrians during a violentsnowstorm and pursued them for many miles Hundreds of Austrianssurrendered][Footnote 21 Pshasnish]  CHAPTER XVI  THE FALL OF PRZEMYSLYou will remember that while von Hindenburg was vainly attempting topierce the river line of the Niemen and the Narev on the Russian rightwing the Austrians were in motion against the south or left wing Onpage 249 of our third volume I gave you a map which I repeat on page119 showing the line which the Russians were holding in Galicia at theclose of the year 1914 They then held the northern entrances to theCarpathian passes and had pushed up the Dukla Pass almost to the crestNewspaper readers in this country believed that before long the Russianlegions would be pouring down on the Hungarian plain and that when thegreat granary of the Central Powers was invaded the end of the war wouldbe in sightDuring the month of January the Russians strove hard to push across theGalician passes and their cavalry actually descended to the Hungarianplain thirty miles south of the mountains Not only was fighting goingon in Galicia but in Bukovina[22]that is the country of the beechwoodswhich stretches southward from the Dneister across the Pruth andthe Sereth to the eastern face of the Carpathians Ever since September1914 the Russians had held Northern Bukovina and they now wished toconquer the whole of it for several reasons In the first place it wasGermanys main source of supply for petrol in the second place it layon the frontier of Rumania and it was thought that the presence of aRussian army in Bukovina would induce Rumania to join the AlliesFurther if Rumania should elect to do so she would be able to joinhands at once with the Russians In the third place there are severalfairly easy passes from Bukovina into Hungary and one of them is themain route from the north to the plains of HungaryThe Russians had only a division in Bukovina and the Austrians opposedthem with a force which was not much stronger By the middle of Januaryalmost all the country was in the hands of the Russians They hadhowever not yet secured the pass which would enable them to advanceinto HungaryThe time had now come for the Austrians to make a great effort to saveHungary and to prevent Rumania with her large and wellequipped armyfrom entering into the struggle on the side of the Allies How was thisto be done Two campaigns were necessarythe one to drive backBrussilov from the passes and to relieve Przemysl and the other toclear Bukovina of the invadersLet us see how the campaign in Bukovina fared Three Austrian corps andone German corps crossed the mountains and advanced in two columns TheRussians you will remember had only one division with which to meetthese four army corps They were obliged to fall back and thus Bukovinawas cleared The Austrians captured town after town and early in Marchthey entered Stanislau[23] a railway junction only seventy miles fromLemberg They were delighted with their success and they reported thatthey had made huge captures of prisoners They had now reached aposition from which they could threaten the Russian communicationsSoon however it was discovered that the Russians had only fallen backto a point where they could be reinforced As soon as their numbers weresufficiently increased they advanced again and pushed the Austrians outof Stanislau and almost back to the line of the Pruth By doing so theyremoved the danger to their communications[Illustration Position of the Russians in Galicia at the end of 1914]Meanwhile what had happened in Galicia Two Austrian armies had beenfighting fierce battles in the deep snows and slush of the CarpathiansWith infinite labour guns and transports had been hauled up the icyslopes where a foothold could barely be maintained Infantry attackswere difficult the white snow threw up the figures of the men who thusbecame excellent targets no matter what uniforms they wore Even nightattacks were revealed for on moonless nights the light reflected fromthe snow made all things clear Both sides suffered terribly from thecold but it told more severely on the Austrians than on the Russianswho are accustomed to bitter winters In the last week of January abright sun shone and often the pure white snow was stained scarlet withthe blood of the fallen Blizzards swept across the mountains duringFebruary and checked the fighting on the uplands though it continuedto rage in the foothills Perhaps the most terrible handtohandfighting known to history took place at a little village near the UzsokPass Large German forces for two months vainly tried to oust theRussians who had captured the position from them Some idea of theawful losses sustained by the Germans may be gathered from the statementthat one regiment changed from colonel to drummer boy three and perhapsfour times The village stands on a height and during the winter isshrouded in snow While the furious battles were raging the height wasreduced to bare soil every foot of its surface having been ploughedwith shell and drenched with blood You can imagine the horror of trenchlife in this region with the thermometer below freezingpoint and theicy blizzards blowing almost daily In some places the trenches wereonly forty paces apart and so fierce were the attacks andcounterattacks that eight out of every ten men engaged in them are saidto have fallen At the beginning of February the Russians in this regiondestroyed a whole battalion of Germans save the commander and twentymenThe Austrian army which fought between the Dukla Pass and the Uzsok Passwas charged with the duty of relieving Przemysl but it was held back bythe Russians as also was the army which was operating more to the eastDuring the last days of February and the first days of March Brussilovfought a fierce battle on a ridge near the Uzsok Pass He held theheights drove back the Austrians and even the most desperate bayonetattacks could not force him from his position of vantage The Austrianswere held up and the Russians gained sufficient time to reinforce theirweak troops which had been driven out of Bukovina I have already toldyou that they advanced again and pushed the Austrians back to the lineof the Pruth                           The attempt to relieve Przemysl had failed and on 22nd March thefortress fell Before I proceed to tell you the story of this Russiansuccess let me give you some idea of the situation and importance ofPrzemysl It has been famous as a fortress for a thousand years Inearly times it was regarded as the key to the Hungarian plains and inmodern times it has been considered as the main outlying protection tothe city of Cracow The town claims to date back to the eighth centuryand certainly is one of the oldest cities of Galicia The river Sanwhich washes its walls descends in wide sweeps from the Uzsok Passthrough mountain glens filled with fir and beech trees and then throughthe vales of the foothills which are planted with groves of apricotpear and cherry and are dotted here and there with brightly paintedwooden houses The valley of the San is the orchard land of GaliciaThe first modern forts of Przemysl were erected in 1871 and since thenhave been several times enlarged and improved until on the eve of thewar the fortress was one of the strongest in the country It was a ringfortress like Lige and Namur At a distance of six miles from the citythere was a circle of outer forts with smaller works connecting themWithin this ring about a thousand yards from the city there wasanother circular series of forts Had Russia been supplied with heavysiege guns such as the Germans brought against the Belgian and Frenchfortresses Przemysl would have fallen in a month As it was it heldout during its second siege for seven monthsA glance at the map[24] shows you that Przemysl is chiefly importantbecause of its situation with regard to the railways of Galicia Itstands on the main trunk line connecting Lemberg with Cracow and itgives railway access to the Lupkow and Uzsok passes While Przemysl heldout the Russians had to send supplies to their armies by long androundabout routes and they could not readily mass troops for a bigmovement against the passes As far back as September 27 1914 theRussians had closed round it and had sat tight in their trenches hopingto starve it into surrender The town was not well supplied withprovisions and by the middle of October the defenders were on veryshort commons indeed Then came a blessed respite Von Hindenburgsfirst assault on Warsaw forced Ivanov to retire beyond the San and theAustrians found themselves able to pour food ammunition and suppliesinto the besieged fortress By the 12th of November when the Russianshad surrounded it once more there were four Austrian army corps in theplace and these with the townsfolk and refugees numbered some 200000soulsIt is still a matter of wonder why the Austrians kept four army corps inPrzemysl To hold the twentyfive miles circuit of the fortress 50000men would have been ample and every extra mouth in the place onlybrought the day of surrender nearer One would have supposed that duringthe retreat of the Russians in October distant lines of trenches wouldhave been flung out from Przemysl as had been done at Verdun TheAustrians however showed no foresight and the governor seems to haveconsidered the town a capital place in which to spend the winter Whenthe Russians returned they had nothing to do but sit down and let thegarrison eat up its supplies When food gave out the fortress was boundto fall[Illustration The Fall of PrzemyslFrom the picture by H C SeppingsWright By permission of TheIllustrated London NewsThis picture which was drawn by the artist on the spot shows Russiansadvancing to occupy the fortress and passing on the way large numbersof Austrians who had been captured in the final sortie The town ofPrzemysl is seen in the distance on the right In the background areseen Austrian forts and a railway bridge being blown up Almost in themiddle of the picture a landmine is exploding]In December the Austrians made an attempt to relieve the fortress InChapter XXVII of our third volume I told you how the Austrianslaunched two armies against the Russians who were then threateningCracow and how the Russians were forced to retreat to the positionshown on the map on page 119 During the Russian retreat the Austrianswere so near to Przemysl that they could hear its guns thundering andexchange signals with its garrison by means of searchlights The timehad come for the Austrians within the fortress to dash out and breakthrough the lines of their besiegers On 15th December five regimentsdid soThey broke through the Russian lines at the southeast angle and forfour days there was fierce and doubtful fighting The Russians howevermanaged to drive the Austrians back into the town The sortie hadfailed with a loss of 3000 killed and wounded Shortly afterwardsBrussilov cleared the mouths of the passes and by Christmas DayPrzemysl was once more girdled by a ring of iron I have already toldyou how the AustroGermans made another attempt late in January andearly in February 1915 to relieve the strain on the fortress and how itcame to nought Thereafter the fall of Przemysl was only a matter oftimeFighting went on night and day Many times the Austrians strove to breakout but each time they were driven back with huge losses on bothsides The Russians counterattacked and won several of the fortsThese unexpected blows wrote a Russian general greatly excite thegarrison Right through the night their searchlights sweep to and froover our positions and the long white rays rest trembling on every foldof the ground At times something alarms the forts and the air isinstantly filled with the thunder of Austrian guns The fire is kept upfor thirty minutes to an hour before it subsides again It is worthy ofnote that not a single Russian shell fell within the town itselfBut all the time famine was doing its deadly work Up to December therewas no shortage of food but when the new year set in the rations wereseverely cut down first for the civilians then for the soldiers nextfor the hospitals and finally for the officers The weather grew coldand there was no firewood Bread could not be obtained at all and afowl cost twentyfour shillings Soon the cavalry began slaughteringtheir horses for food By March a cow was selling for 140 and a dogfor 2 10sMr Stanley Washburn a correspondent with the Russian army tells usthat the place was greatly overgarrisoned by patient haggard soldiersstarving in the trenches and sleek faultlesslydressed officers livingon the fat of the land in fashionable hotels and restaurants While thegarrison became thin and half starved the officers ate three meals aday and enjoyed fresh meat cigars wines and every luxury Whilesoldiers were falling fainting in the streets their officers wereleading the life to which they had been accustomed in Vienna duringtimes of peaceOn the night of 13th March the end began The Russians pushed throughthe outer line of defences and began to bombard the inner forts Fourdays later the Austrians strove for the last time to break out but theRussian guns caught them and mowed them down in swathes The survivorswere driven back with heavy loss and 4000 prisoners remained inRussian hands Early on the morning of the 22nd the besiegers wereawakened by the noise of loud explosions The Austrians were blowing upthe forts before surrendering the city We are told that the burningforts smoked like a circle of volcanoes Soon a white flag was seenfluttering above the highest building in the town Przemysl was ready tosurrender Meanwhile the officers were shooting their chargers toprevent them from falling into the hands of the Russians and thesoldiers crazy with hunger were greedily devouring the raw flesh Tonsof explosives were sunk in the river guns and rifles were destroyedand bridges were blown upAbout nine oclock a letter reached the Russian headquarters from theAustrian general saying that hunger had forced him to yield thefortress A few Russian officers entered and received the surrender butthere was no triumphal parade such as had been witnessed when theGermans entered Antwerp    Civilians inform me wrote Mr Washburn that they gladly    welcome the Russians and that the first troops who entered were    greeted with cheers while the garrison was frankly pleased that    the siege was over and their troubles at an end I have seen on    the road and in the town tens of thousands of prisoners and I    believe the Austrians especially the Hungarians are    firstclass raw material but that now they are utterly broken    and helpless This he considered to be due to their wretched    officers who if those seen in Przemysl were fair samples    appeared to be the most selfish and incompetent in Europe I    have never witnessed a more unpleasant sight than that of the    dapper overdressed Austrian officers laughing and chatting    gaily as they were driven in carriages to the railway station    for departure passing through columns of their own men pale    and haggard from hardships which apparently had not been shared    in any particular by their officers                           So fell Przemysl Its capture was not so much a Russian victory as anAustrian disgrace By overcrowding the place with soldiers and puttingcareless ignorant officers in charge of them the Austrians ensured itsdownfall About 120000 prisoners including 2600 officers fell intoRussian hands about 1000 guns were captured 180 of them fit for useas well as a large amount of shell and smallarm ammunition Russia hadobtained an excellent base from which to advance against the centralpasses of the Carpathians and she had set free an army of 100000 menfor future operationsThe fall of Przemysl was greeted with great delight by the Allies andit was thought that before the end of the summer Cracow would be sure tofall Silesia would be entered and the Russian legions would besweeping through Hungary Alas these rosy hopes were soon to bedisappointed Within five weeks clouds began to gather in the East TheRussians were caught napping The strongest army which Germany had evermustered was hurled against them and huge guns drove them remorselesslyback from the soil which they had so hardly won Less than forty daysafter the AustroGermans began to move Przemysl was once more in theirhands Nor was the retreat stayed until the Russians were driven farback on their own soil and the very existence of their armies was atstake[Footnote 22 Bookovna][Footnote 23 Stanislow 75 m SSE of Lemberg It has extensiverailroad shops][Footnote 24 Vol III p 247]  CHAPTER XVII  STORIES FROM EASTERN BATTLEFIELDSIn this chapter I shall tell you some stories illustrating the fiercefighting which took place in the Eastern theatre of war during the firstthree months of the year 1915 I have already told you that Russianwomen frequently disguised themselves as men and fought with greatheroism in the ranks A Russian girl named Alexandra Lagereva wasawarded a commission early in the year for fine soldierly conduct in thefield During one of the battles fought near Suwalki her detachment wassurrounded by the Germans and forced to surrender Alexandra noticedfrom the way in which her captors looked at her that they had guessedher secret Perhaps for this reason they did not go through her pocketsin which she carried a watch and a compassThe prisoners were locked up in a church and a sentry was placed at thedoor At night when all was quiet Alexandra formed a plan of escape Awindow was broken and the girl crept through it She stealthilyapproached the sentry whom she felled with a stone Then several of hercomrades clambered out of the window recovered their horses and alongwith her made off Soon however a force of eighteen Uhlans barredtheir way but Alexandra and her comrades managed to capture them Whenthe German lieutenant learned that his eighteen men had been overpoweredby a girl and six Russians he tore his hair in rage He was found to becarrying important papers and these Alexandra took to the nearestRussian commander whose report on her gallant conduct led to herpromotion She was described as of middle height slender and gracefuland by no means of that masculine character which her deeds would leadone to suppose                           Mr Washburn who has already been mentioned in these pages tells usthat the Russian officer looks upon his men as his children and thatthey call him father It is a strange relation he says that onesees between them I recall seeing a grizzled old colonel marching hismuchcutup regiment past him on the plains of Poland after an actionAs each company passed the old hero called out in his deep bass voiceI am pleased with you my children you have done well And eachcompany replied in unison Thank you father we are willing to do asmuch again And then they all marched back to the trenches and took upthe burden of the campaign once more                           You have already heard much about the Cossacks who used to beconsidered demons of cruelty but are now known to be much like otherRussianseasygoing kindly and goodnatured One of the Cossackregiments is described as being clad in baggy greatcoats of undressedsheepskin dyed a deep claret colour while other regiments sport similargarments of a bright orange hue All wear on their heads hairy busbiesabout the size of a bushel measure Each man owns his horse and groomsit until it looks like a racing thoroughbred The Germans go in terrorof the Cossacks A story is told that when a German soldier was capturedin Poland he looked uneasily about him On being asked what worried himhe said The Cossacks He then went on to say that he and his comradesbelieved that the Cossacks could not be trusted alone even by theRussians They were he said brought to the front in huge vans andwhen an action began the vans were turned towards the enemy and thedoors were thrown open when out leaped the Cossacks sword in hand anddashed upon the foe When the fight was over so he told his captorsthe Cossacks were rounded up and coaxed back into their cages wherethey were kept in confinement until the next battle                           An American doctor who offered his services to Russia because Russiastuck to us during the Civil War tells us that though the Germans arebetter rifle shots than the Russians they cannot compare with theTsars soldiers when it comes to the bayonet When these moujiks[25]said the doctor climb out of their trenches and begin to sing theirnational songs they just go crazy and they arent scared of anythingand believe me when the Germans see them coming across the fieldsbellowing these songs of theirs they just dont wait one minute butdig right out across the landscape as fast as they can tear I dontthink theres a soldier in the world that has anything on the Russianprivate for bravery They are a stubborn lot too and will sit intrenches in all weathers and be just as cheerful under one condition asanother One big advantage over here as I regard it is the goodrelations between the soldiers and their officers                           Mr Washburn tells us[26] how the colonel of a Russian battery had agreat laugh on the enemy What happened was this A German Taube flewover the line several times and it kept coming back so frequently andhovering over the battery that the officers who were watching it becamesuspicious that they had been spotted When darkness fell the men ofthe battery became extremely busy and by working like bees moved theirguns perhaps 600 yards to the south and by daylight had them in the newpositions and fairly well masked Shortly after sunrise back came theaeroplane and when over the old position it gave a signal to its ownlines and then flew back Almost instantly shells fell fast and thick onthe abandoned spot Six hundred yards away the men of the batterywatched the shells falling and laughed their sides out at the way theyhad fooled the Germans    From glancing at the field torn up withshell fire one begins to realize what observation means to the enemyWith modern methods a single signal from an aeroplane may mean thewiping out in a few minutes of an unsuspecting battery that has beensafely hidden for months[Footnote 25 Mooziks Russian peasants][Footnote 26 The Russian Campaign April to August 1915 by StanleyWashburn]  CHAPTER XVIII  THE BATTLE OF NEUVE CHAPELLEWe now return to the sodden plains of Flanders where the torn andslashed fields the riven woods and the tattered hedgerows arebeginning to don the livery of spring Men looking out of their trenchesare gladdened by the pale sunshine the tender green of the youngleaves the songs of the birds the patches of blue in the showery skyand the early flowers that coyly peep out amidst the grass These signswhich in the happy days of peace foretell the manifold delights ofsummer have no such meaning for the men in the trenches yet they arewelcome for they indicate that the long inactivity of the winter isdrawing to a close The day will soon arrive when the soiled andbattered men who have watched each other so long from muddy holes in theground will come to close grips again Fierce relentless warfare willbegin once more with what result only the future can tell One thing iscertainmany of those who now watch the miracle of spring will neversee the glory of summerThe month of March has come The trenches are in much the same positionas they were in the preceding November The gains and losses of the lastfive months have been trifling But amongst the Allies there is afeeling that their day has at last arrived Especially strong is thisbelief in the British lines New troops are crossing the narrow seasevery day the Canadians and many Territorial divisions are in thefield and before the month is over there are half a million Britons onFrench and Flemish soil Never before have we arrayed such a mightyarmy It is fiftyfive times as great as that with which King Harrycharged the French at Agincourt twelve times as great as that withwhich Wellington won victories in the Peninsula twentyfive times asgreat as the British part of the mixed army with which he made an end ofNapoleon at Waterloo and twice as great as that which brought theSouth African War to a close Four months ago the little British armyhad barely been able to beat off the fierce attacks of an overwhelmingenemy By miracles of valour alone had our muchtried soldiers been ableto stem the torrent in the first onset of its fury Now for every manwho kept the gate at La Basse and Ypres there are four Britons andGermans have now changed parts It is ours to attack theirs to defend                           By the middle of February our General Staff felt itself strong enough totake the offensive In Chapter IX I told you how the French inChampagne had punctured the German line by means of an intensebombardment of the opposing trenches We were now ready to make asimilar attempt If you look at the map on page 132 you will see athick black line showing the position of our trenches about midwaybetween La Basse and Estaires In front of the village of NeuveChapelle this line makes a distinct sag to the westward It was uponthis section of the line that we meant to operate and we hoped that wemight not only capture the village and straighten out our line but pushthe Germans off the Aubers ridge from which coign of vantage the LaBasseLille railway line could be commanded If fortune were kind wemight even reach Lille itselfThough Neuve Chapelle is only a small village its fame is now worldwide and it will figure in the history books of the future It is anunimportant collection of houses and small farms scattered about ajunction of country roads with a church in its centre Our soldierslooking eastward from the British front could see the long stragglingline of houses among gardens and the white church standing up tall andclear from the flat marshy land Let us suppose that we are aviatorsflying over the pretty village What do we see First we notice thebroad highway running from La Basse to Estaires AA and from thisroad see two other roads less than a mile apart running parallel in anortheasterly direction BB and CC A road DD almost parallel to thebroad highway AA connects these roads and thus forms a diamondshapedfigure which is divided into two by a winding cross road EE NeuveChapelle lies within the northern half of the diamond Along the roadDD the houses are small and stand close together those along theroads CC and EE are surrounded by gardens and orchards At thenortheast of the village F there is a small piece of ground filledwith enclosures and bounded on three sides by roads Here the Germanshave made a strong post so as to flank the approaches to the villagefrom the north Between the houses and the La BasseEstaires road aremeadows and ploughland seamed with German trenches At the northernangle of the diamond our own trenches are but 100 yards away from thoseof the Germans In other parts of the line the distance is greater[Illustration]From our lofty eyrie we look eastward and make out a clearlymarkedridge which is well known to us as the Aubers ridge We see at a glancethat Neuve Chapelle is the gateway to this ridge Between the ridge andthe village runs a small stream and behind it to the southeast isthe Biez wood Along the stream is the German second line of defencewith strong posts at the bridgeheads We notice that the stream crossesthe La BasseEstaires road and that to the north of it is a group ofruined buildings which our men call Port Arthur A mile eastward fromthe village is Pietre[27] Mill with a tall chimney which is a landmarkfor miles around From the mill to Port Arthur runs a great network ofGerman trenches Earthworks are also to be seen in the Biez wood to thesoutheast of the stream It is clear that before our soldiers canattain the ridge and threaten Lille they must carry this formidableline[Illustration The Battle of Neuve ChapelleThe black line shows the general position of the British front beforethe battle A 24th Brigade B 23rd Brigade C 25th Division DGarhwal Brigade E Dehra Dun Brigade]On 8th March Sir John French called his commanders together andexplained his plans The main assault was to be made by the First Armyand two Indian divisions were to share in it while the Second Army wasto form a general support In order to prevent the Germans from sendingup reinforcements to the scene of the main attack two other attackswere to take place at the same time the one from Givenchy the otherjust south of Armentires A great mass of artillery was to be broughtup and a bombardment four times as intense as any which we had yet madewas to be undertaken Then when the German trenches were wrecked ourinfantry were to go forward and attempt to drive a deep wedge into theGerman line If all went well we might be in Lille within a few daysOn the 8th and 9th of March our big guns were brought up very quietlyand placed in position We were able to do this quite unknown to theGermans because our aircraft had gained the upper hand of theirs Allsorts of big guns were massed together and their positions are roughlyshown on the map page 132 Meanwhile from ten oclock that eveningendless files of men marched silently down the roads leading towards ourtrenches Watch the troops as they file by Here are sturdy Garhwaliswith slouch hats and kukris at their belts and farther down the roadyou see Gurkhas Here too are the Leicestersthe Tigers as theyare called from their badge Yonder go the Lincolns and the BerkshiresYou see the silver cross of the Rifle Brigade the star and bugle of theScottish Rifles the Black Watch in their bonnets the North Hants andthe Worcesters heroes of Ypres Halted by the road are the Middlesexthe West Yorks the Devons Every British dialect is heard men are herefrom Lands End to John o Groats All are eager for the fray all longfor the moment when the whistles will blow and the command will begiven Over the parapet Charge                           Before morning our trenches were literally wedged with men waiting insilence for the dawn From the enemys front there was as yet no sign ofalarm though their trenches at many points were less than one hundredyards away A prisoner afterwards said that his captain noticed themassing of our men and sent urgent messages to the artillery to openfire but with no result Before sunrise on the morning of the 10th hotmeals were served out all along our line for as everybody knows aBriton fights best when his inner man is satisfied Then came anotherlong wait in tense silence Aeroplanes buzzed aloft and every now andthen officers looked at their watches Every man knew that with theearliest light of morning the guns would begin to speak and that sometime later he and his fellows would be out in the open making for theenemys line as hard as they could pelt The minutes dragged on Wouldthe dawn never comeAway to the east the faint light of a gray and sullen day now began toappear The heavy clouds hung low in the sky and ahead the mistshrouded the view Before long the Germans knew that a big attack waspreparing but they took no steps to meet it Our artillery now began toboom ranging shots were being fired but soon all was silent againOn the stroke of 730 some 350 guns suddenly spoke with an overpoweringdin that racked the brain and split the ears The terrific roar wasincessant and the discharges were so rapid that it seemed as if theycame from a gigantic machine gun The very earth shook as though struckby Thors[28] hammer The first shells that hit the German positionraised huge clouds of smoke and dust and nothing could be seen but thegreen fumes of lyddite and the spouting columns of red earthBarbedwire entanglements were blown into a myriad fragments parapetscrumbled like sand castles and trenches on which men had worked formonths were flung into shapeless ruin Bodies of mangled men were hurledhigh into the air and ghastly fragments were blown back into theBritish lines Four shells were hurled on every yard of the Germantrenches and more ammunition was used in the thirtyfive minutes duringwhich the bombardment lasted than in a year and a half of the SouthAfrican War Long before the awful cannonade ended the German trencheshad ceased to exist They were reduced to a welter of earth and dustWhile the bombardment lasted our troops could walk outside theirtrenches in safety for the Germans were so pinned to the ground thatthose of them who remained alive dared not lift their heads From behindthe ragged clouds in the sky where the aeroplanes were sailing the sunnow began to shine making still darker the black pall that hung overthe German position and flashing back from the rows of gleamingbayonets in the British trenches At five minutes to eight our gunnerslengthened their fuses and shells began to fall fast and furiously onthe village itself Some of the houses were seen to leap into the airColumns of dust like the sand spouts of the desert sprang up trees wentdown like wheat before a sickle bricks and stones fell in torrentsThen came the great moment Whistles blew our men swarmed over theparapets and rushed towards the German trenches[Illustration The Rifle Brigade racing headlong through the Ruins ofNeuve Chapelle during the Attack on the VillageFrom the picture by Christopher Clark By permission of The SphereThe village says a writer who visited the scene a few days after thebattle was a sight that the men say they will never forget Once upona time Neuve Chapelle must have been a pretty little place big asvillages in these parts go with a nice clean church whence it probablygot its name some neat villas half a dozen inns a redbrick breweryand on the outskirts a little old white chteau Now hardly stoneremains on stone It was indeed a scene of desolation into which theRifle Brigadethe first regiment to enter the village I believeracedheadlong Of the church only the bare shell remained the interior waslost to view beneath a gigantic mound of rubbish Of all that once fairvillage but two things remained intactthe great crucifixes rearedaloft one in the churchyard the other over against the chteau Fromthe cross that is the emblem of our faith the figure of Christ yetintact though all pitted with bullet marks looked down in mute agonyon the slaying in the village]Five separate infantry attacks were made on the village The firstattack was made by the 24th Brigade to the north of the village thesecond by the 23rd Brigade against its northeast corner the thirdby the 25th Division against the village itself the fourth by theGarhwal Brigade of Indians against its southwest corner and thefifth by the Dehra Dun Brigade against Port Arthur The 25th pushedinto the wreckage of the German trenches without difficulty They wereonly occupied by the shreds and tatters of the dead and a few dazed andstupefied men their faces yellow with fumes their clothes torn fromtheir backs and their equipment and weapons destroyed In some places afew machine guns which had escaped destruction kept up fire fromconcealed positions and snipers took toll of our men as they advancedThe first to reach the goal were the 2nd Lincolns and the 2nd RoyalBerkshires who opened out to let the Irish Rifles and the Rifle Brigadepass through them and take the village From a trench in front of theBerkshires came the rattle of machinegun fire Two German officersalone were working the gun and they continued to fire until they fellbeneath the bayonets of our men Equally gallant deeds were done on theBritish side A lancecorporal who had been wounded three times and hadbeen told to lie down insisted on advancing with his fellows Nor was hethe only wounded man who plied bayonet and grenade on that red dayThe village was now only a rubbish heap the church was a broken shelland the very graves in the churchyard had been torn open by our shellsStrange to say while houses and trees were falling a crucifix at thecross roads remained untouched and spread its gaunt arms in muteprotest above the terrible scene of slaughter and destruction Once moreour gunners lifted their sights and lengthened their fuses and betweenthe village and the German supports in the rear created a curtain offire through which no living thing could pass Then our men swept intothe battered streets Through the thick pall of smoke Germans were seenon all sides some holding up their hands others flying for life andothers again firing from the windows from behind carts and even frombehind overturned tombstones Machine guns clacked viciously from houseson the outskirts and many a Briton fell a victim to them Neverthelessbefore long the village was wholly oursThe Garhwalis to the right of the 25th were equally successful Within aquarter of an hour after the assault began they had carried the firstline of German trenches and soon afterwards the 3rd Gurkhas met theRifle Brigade in the southern outskirts of the village Together theyswept on past the heap of ruins which had once been the hamlet of PortArthur into the woods at the foot of the rising groundNow comes the tragical part of the story The 23rd Brigade whichattacked to the left of the 25th advanced you will remember againstthe northeast of the village Unhappily the artillery had not properlyshelled this part of the German position and in a slight hollow thewire entanglements and the trenches were almost untouched When the 2ndDevons the 2nd West Yorks the 2nd Scottish Rifles Cameronians andthe 2nd Middlesex pushed forward they found themselves up againstunbroken wire The Cameronians suffered severely A storm of bulletsfrom rifles and machine guns assailed them but they never wavered Goon they could not go back they would not Men were seen in that zone ofdeath tearing at the wire with raw and bleeding hands while theircomrades were falling fast around them Those who survived were obligedto retire and lie down in the open under a tornado of shot and shelluntil one company made a gap and broke through the line of defenceFifteen officers including the commander Colonel Bliss were killed orwounded and when the terrible day was over only 150 men out of 750answered the roll call You have many noble honours on your colourssaid Sir John French when he addressed the gallant remnant some dayslater none are finer than that of Neuve Chapelle which will soon beadded to themThe 2nd Middlesex had a similar trial and bore it with the samebravery Machine guns were turned on them from several points and asthey pressed forward men fell at every step Three times they strove toreach the trench but three times they failed and were forced to liedown in the open until a message was sent back to the artillery Gunswere relaid on the trench and before long the entanglements weredestroyed When this was done the Middlesex aided by a bombing partycarried the position and were able to move forward to an orchard on thenortheast of the village where they joined the Devonshires The 1stBattalion of the Kings Liverpool which was attached to the illfateddivision also found itself up against unbroken wire A companysergeantmajor spent five minutes under the entanglement trying to cutit and miraculously escaped with his life The colonel though woundedrefused to leave his men and remained with them throughout the day Ayoung officer who had been shot down near the wire kept shouting to hismen to come on until his breath failed him In this battalion alone 100men were killed and 119 were wounded[Illustration Neuve Chapelle March 10 1915From the drawing by D Macpherson By permission of The SphereThis picture shows a batch of the Prussian Guards surrendering to the2nd Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment at the first line of trenchesbefore the village of Neuve Chapelle The distance at this point fromthe British advanced line was about sixtyfive yards and our men wereupon the enemy while most of them were still dazed from the effects ofthe terrific bombardment The prisoners were taken in batches of thirtyor forty and were handed over to the oncoming lines of supports untilthey were passed back to headquarters the captors meanwhile sweeping onwith the advance]Meanwhile the success of the 25th Brigade had turned the flank of theGermans north of the village and when the 23rd Brigade at last managedto struggle through the orchard and join hands with the 24th Brigadewhich had attacked to their left the time had come for the combinedforce to sweep onward to the Aubers ridge The Germans were still dazedwith surprise and completely paralyzed by the heavy bombardment of themorning while our men were flushed with victory and were eager topress forward But at this moment there was a long delay The telephonewires had been cut by the bursting shells and it was difficult to getorders quickly to the first line The check to the 23rd Brigade hadthrown everything out of gear A halt had to be called for fresh troopsto come up and they were very slow in arriving The village was ours bynoon but not until 330 did the reserve brigades arrive Had they beenbrought up promptly the Aubers ridge would have been won As it was wewere robbed of a great victory A splendid chance had been thrown awayand an unavailing sacrifice of life was to followThe newlyarrived brigades all belonging to the 7th Division which hadwon such glory in the October battle round Ypres formed up on the leftof the 24th Brigade and the attack began again but everywheredifficulties were met with The Germans had taken advantage of the lullto strengthen their third line of trenches and had brought upreinforcements When our men advanced they were ready to receive themThe Indian brigades pushed through the wood towards the ridge but couldmake but little headway and suffered terrible losses One of the Indianbattalions would have been entirely cut off but for a splendid bombingattack by the 2nd Leicesters It was at this point of the battle thatthe 3rd Londona Territorial regimentmade a brilliant charge to aidthe front line and won the cheers of their regular comrades by theirgallantry and devotionFurther to our left the 25th Division was checked along the line of thelittle river while the 24th Brigade and 7th Division were held up bymachinegun fire from the cross roads and the defences of Pietre MillThe line of the river could not be forced without artillerypreparation Everywhere in this part of the line there were Germanpositions which our big guns had not touched To push infantry againstthem was simple murder So as the evening closed in we busiedourselves in strengthening the positions which we had already won Thevillage was ours we had gained a mile and had straightened out ourline We had however failed in the bigger business of seizing theAubers ridgeNot until darkness fell did the 1st Brigade of the First Corps arriveNext morning our guns began to boom again but they could not repeat thesurprise of yesterday The Germans had pulled themselves together theirlines were strongly reinforced and mist prevented the artilleryobservers from directing the fire of their guns More than once ourinfantry were caught by their own shells We could make no furtherheadway and on the 12th the Bavarians advanced against Neuve Chapellean officer on horseback with drawn sword leading them right up to theWorcesters who met them with a shattering fire At another pointtwentyone machine guns were turned against them and they fell by thehundred So fierce was the fire that the survivors were forced toprotect themselves behind ramparts of their own deadAll that day the 7th Division struggled to carry Pietre Mill while therest of the line attacked the bridges over the river and the Germantrenches in the wood Round about the mill the fighting was very fierceground was gained and lost again houses were captured and recapturedand friend and foe were mixed up in confused handtohand fighting Hereit was that the 6th Gordons lost LieutenantColonel Maclean A subalternfound him lying in the open behind the trench with a bullet in his backand sinking fast The young officer brought him morphia to ease hispain and when he had taken it he said And now my boy your place isnot here Go about your duty So died a very gallant gentlemanVictoria Crosses were won on this part of the front by Private EdwardBarber and LanceCorporal Wilfred Fuller of the Grenadiers for abrilliant bombing attack of which we shall read later Further souththe 2nd Rifle Brigade managed to carry a section of German trenches andSergeantMajor Daniels and Corporal Noble did deeds of outstandingvalour which won them the proudest decoration that a soldier can wearUnhappily their unit the Rifle Brigade was enfiladed and forced tofall back on its old linesBy the evening of the 12th Sir John French was convinced that nothingmore could be won and he ordered the attack to be suspended for thepresent All the 13th was spent by our weary soldiers in diggingthemselves in on the banks of the little river which they had failed tocross So worn out were many of the men that they fell asleep whilestanding at their loopholes Counterattacks were to be expected andthey soon began but met with no success Only at one point northeastof the village did the Germans manage to get into our trenches andtheir stay was brief indeed In one of their attacks they lost more than600 prisoners and the captured men seemed glad to be out of theterrible fightingThe most severe counterattack was made not at Neuve Chapelle but atthe tiny Belgian hamlet of St Eloi 15 miles to the north and at thejunction of two main roads On the 14th when mists lay thick on theflats the Germans following our example at Neuve Chapelle began afierce bombardment of our trenches and at the same time exploded mineson our front and on a large mound which we held to the southeast of thevillage The infantry attacks of the enemy were very determined our menwere driven from their trenches and our whole line had to fall backUnder cover of the darkness we prepared for a counterattack and on themorning of the 15th managed to win back most of the lost ground Themound which our soldiers called the Mound of Death was notrecovered it lay in the No Mans Land between the rival trenchesexposed to the gun fire of friend and foeIn this action Princess Patricias Own specially distinguished itselfand won the praise of Sir John French It cooperated with a battalionof the Rifle Brigade in an attack on the mound and advanced with greatcoolness and resolution but was checked by a murderous machinegunfire Three platoons however held on to a breastwork while theremainder retired across a zone of fire without leaving behind them asingle wounded man Five days later Princess Pats lost its commandingofficer LieutenantColonel Francis Farquhar one of the bravest andkindest of menYou will remember that our assault on Neuve Chapelle was supported byother attacks on various parts of the German front in order to preventthe enemy from suddenly massing reinforcements against our main attackI need not describe these operations for they were only holdingattacks and were not expected to succeed Nevertheless the assault ona hamlet to the southeast of Armentires was successful and an advanceof 300 yards on a front of half a mile was madeOur airmen were very busy during the three days of struggle though theweather was against them Bombs were dropped on railway stations andbridges behind the German lines and much damage was done One daringaviator flying over Lille hit a house which was used as the GermanheadquartersThe Battle of Neuve Chapelle was not a failure but it was not acomplete success We straightened out the sag in our line we won thevillage advanced one mile took 2000 prisoners and killed or wounded20000 of the enemy Our offensive put new heart into our men who wentinto battle with the utmost zeal joking and laughing even under fireIt is said that when they crowded into the German firstline trenchesand there was no room for them all to line the parapet a man would pullhis comrade down crying out that it was his turn for a shot TheIndians greatly welcomed the opportunity of fighting in the open andthe Gurkhas and Garhwalis plied their kukris with deadly effect Ourlosses were very heavy In the three days fighting we had about 13000casualties 2337 men and 190 officers were killedOur failure to make good at a time when the Germans were almost at ourmercy was as much due to accident as to blunder Parts of the enemylines had not been properly prepared and some of our troops wereshelled by their own guns This was no doubt due to the dull sky andthe mists which prevented the observers from properly controlling thefire of their guns It was our first attempt to combine artillery andinfantry on a great scale and naturally mistakes were made The bestresult was the new ardour which inspired our men This time said oneof them it was pushing the Germans instead of trying to hold themYou cant realize unless you have been in it from Mons onwards howthat bucks you up                           The German people took their beating very badly They accused us ofusing German prisoners to screen our advance and they complainedbitterly that we had brought such a vast force of artillery againstthem This is not war it is murder they said coolly ignoring thefact that a mighty artillery onslaught had been their favourite methodof attack since the beginning of the war When they were given a tasteof their own medicine they cried out in the usual fashion of the bully[Footnote 27 Peeaitr][Footnote 28 The Thunderer the blacksmith god of the ancient Norse Heis represented as wielding a hammer]  CHAPTER XIX  SOLDIERS STORIES OF NEUVE CHAPELLEAs soon as the wounded men from Neuve Chapelle arrived in Great Britainbudgets of personal experiences began to appear in the newspapers Allthe men dwelt upon the terrible effects of our artillery and thesplendid spirit shown by our troops not only while under fire but whenstricken down Private Selwood of the Rifle Brigade said Men whofought at Mons have told me that Mons was only a teafight compared withNeuve Chapelle In the halfhours bombardment that began the day somesay 400 guns were used others 525 The noise was terrific Our boyswent on cheerful enough singing Tipperary and anything When we gotto the dugouts we found dozens of Germans all dead It was a surpriseattack They did not know it was coming off At the third line oftrenches I was hit in the leg by a bullet I crawled back about fivehundred yards because there was too much work for the stretcherbearersThey worked heroically taking the most serious cases first                           A private of the 4th Black Watch thus describes a Highland charge Wewitnessed a magnificent charge of the first battalion of a famousScottish regiment Artillery fire ceased suddenly and before the enemycould be reorganized the kilties were over our trenches and dashing atthem with fixed bayonets It might have been a parade advance soperfectly did each section of the line move forward Th The first lotsprang up and over the German trenches followed almost immediately bythe rest and in a very few minutes the trench was ours Just beforedusk I laughed for the first time that day And no wonder for at onepoint on that gory battlefield stood a noticeboard inscribed with oneword Danger                           EyeWitness tells us how our men behaved while they were watching theartillery bombarding the enemys trenches and waiting for the word toadvance They could see our shells bursting in the thick veil of smokeand dust that hung over the German trenches and as the minutes wore onour artillery fire grew hotter and hotter and the time grew nearer forthem to rush forward Their excitement rose to fever pitch In someplaces they were seen to jump up on the parapets brandishing theirrifles towards the Germans and shouting remarks which were drowned inthe roar of the guns When the rush was actually made our losses weretrifling It was only in the subsequent advance that heavy casualtiesoccurred                           It is noteworthy that the enemys wounded had to thank our men for manyacts of kindness even in the excitement of the assault One of oursoldiers finding a wounded Prussian officer who had had his arm blownoff by a shell carried him to a place of safety under heavy fire Inone cellar a portly German was found dancing about in an agony of fearscreaming in a highpitched voice in English Mercy mercy I ammarried Your missus wont thank us for sending you home replied oneof our men who took him prisoner and his life was spared A RifleBrigade lieutenant falling over a sandbag into a German trench cameupon two officers hardly more than boys holding their hands abovetheir heads Their faces were ashen gray and they were trembling Onesaid gravely in good English Dont shoot I am from London also Theytoo were spared                           During the counterattacks of the Germans from the Biez wood theirlosses were very heavy Line after line went down before our rifles Oneof our Sepoys said that shooting the enemy was like cutting grain Someof the German officers displayed the most reckless courage in leadingthe attacks On more than one occasion they invited certain death byriding forward on horseback to within a few hundred yards of our lineNone of those who so exposed themselves escaped One German officer incharge of a machine gun kept his gun in action throughout the terriblebombardment and then when our men charged down upon him awaiteddeath calmly standing on the parapet of the trench and emptying hisrevolver at them                           The Indians were greatly pleased at the result of the action andconstantly asked their officers when they were going to have anotherfight Many stories are told of their prowess One Gurkha made his wayinto a house and singlehanded captured five Germans whom he marchedoff at the point of his kukri It was curious to see the Indiansreturning with articles of German equipment When they held them up forinspection they called out Souvenir souvenir[29][Illustration Bengal Lancers returning from Port Arthur after thecapture of Neuve ChapelleFrom the picture by F Matania By permission of The SphereNotice the souvenirs which they are carrying on their lances]Canadian infantry were not specially engaged in the fighting at NeuveChapelle but the Canadian artillery played an active part in thebombardment which preceded the British advance and the infantry wereready during the battle to go forward at a moments notice A Winnipegboy wrote home as follows At 530 on the morning of Wednesday thefirst day of the Neuve Chapelle attack our officer told us to hurryover our breakfast as a heavy fire was to be opened by our side andthe enemy in replying would probably drop a few rounds in ourvicinity We had just started to line up in the road outside whenwhop came a shell which burst a few yards ahead Double for thetrenches was the order and away we went The trenches were only aboutone hundred and fifty yards away yet the Germans had our position to afoot and sixteen rounds of shrapnel burst literally in our midst Hadthey burst overhead as they should have done its a very fair bet thatnearly every man of us would have gone west but only one man was hita fellow a short distance back of me    We had to stay in thetrenches until evening that day and all next day                           A wounded German officer said that the suddenness of our bombardment waslike the burst of a great storm instantly filling all the space withcountless crashes of thunder flame smoke and lead Six of your greatblack howitzer shells said he fell within fifty yards of a trench onmy right and so completely was our trench blown asunder that when theearth fell back it buried hundreds with it When the storm abated Icrawled out only to be bayoneted in the shoulder by as I learned aTerritorial and while I was lying there thousands of British pursuingour retreating battalion passed by me But I lifted my sound arm andthey spared mewhy I do not know It seemed to take hours for theBritish soldiers to pass me and then I saw groups of my own regimentunguarded and without guns many slightly wounded walking back to theBritish base Such faces I did not think could be worn by human beingsthey were orange with lyddite smoke The men were palsied with what theyhad been through and were too dazed to answer my call                           The part played by the 2nd Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment and the IrishRifles in the advance towards the line of the little river is thusdescribedTwo companies of the Lincolns rushed the enemys trenches under apretty hot fire Grenades were thrown at the enemy and they ran out oftheir trench to the rear There however Captain Peakes company threwgrenades to cut off their line of retreat and they ran back to theirtrench and surrendered Captain Peake who had advanced down the trenchholding his blue flag up in the air offered a conspicuous target to theenemy and was shot Meanwhile two other companies had followed throughthe gap caused by the charge the enemy seemed in full retreat and ourmen were very elatedMany who were hit continued to advance LanceCorporal Perry was hitrather badly in the foot three times and though told to take cover andlie down persisted in going on and rallying his men The reinforcedline continued to advance until they reached a broad strip of waterrunning right across their front from four feet to five feet deep andquite impassable After a while a plank was found sufficiently long tobridge the water and the men crossed to form a firing line on the otherside The heavy guns were shelling the Germans about one hundred andfifty yards in front and on the Lincolns opening fire they retiredA few minutes after the Lincolns had recrossed the water to a slightrise behind it the Irish Rifles went through and were given a lustycheer Lieutenant Graham was rallying his men with a French newsboyshorn giving a View hullo like a Master of Hounds collecting his packOne company of the Lincolns crossed the water for the third time andassisted the Irish Rifles in making a trench Afterwards they returnedto entrench themselves behind the water                           A young officer who fought in the battle wrote home as follows Myword mother yesterday we commenced a most almighty attack on theunsuspecting enemy It had all been planned and organized for some timeand I should think it has been the finest show on record Whether we hadthe advantage in the number of men I cannot say but we certainly had inguns You never heard such a din in all your life All the farmhousesvibrated all day long and during the first halfhour there were some17000 shells screaming towards the Bosches Our lads who were woundedcame down the road in batches of twos and threes to the dressingstations They were very cheerful They simply laughed and cracked jokesamongst themselves They are a wonderful lot of Tommies They were allso jolly brave and keen and determined                           A private of the Berkshire Regiment thus related his experiences Welost fairly heavily in the big fight at Neuve Chapelle but the loss weinflicted on the Germans must have been frightful They were lying allover the place There was great rejoicing when we found that ourregiment had been selected for the post of honour with the Lincolnsforming the first line of the frontal attack    Our boys were outlike one man and charged across to their first trench We took that inless than five minutes and leaving a few men to secure the prisonersswept on to the next Men were falling on every side as their machineguns and artillery were playing on us from beyond the village and someof the sights were terrible It seemed as though the air was full ofshrapnel and bullets but our boys were magnificent Not one manwavered even for a second and nothing could have stopped that chargeThe second trench was soon cleared out and our bomb throwerswe callthem Ticklers Artillery[30]did terrible execution On we went forthe third line This was a bit more difficult as there were a thickhedge and some barbed wire But the boys would not be stopped and in avery short time the third line was ours The Rifles now came on to takethe village and they gave us a cheer and a shout of Well done Berksas they passed through We gave them an answering call as they chargedand captured the village                           I will conclude this chapter with a brief account of the ten heroes whowere awarded Victoria Crosses for splendid deeds of valour at NeuveChapellePrivate William Buckingham 2nd Battalion the Leicestershire RegimentYou will remember that at Neuve Chapelle the 2nd Leicesters wereattached to the Garhwal Brigade and that when a Garhwali battalion wascut off a bombing party of the Leicesters brought them timely andeffective assistance No regiment played a finer part in the battle thanthe Leicesters The Victoria Cross was awarded to Private Buckingham forhis bravery and devotion to duty in rescuing wounded men and inrendering first aid to the fallen while exposed to heavy fire on severaloccasions notably on the 10th and 12th of MarchRifleman Gobar Sing Negi 2nd Battalion 39th Garhwal RiflesGobar Sing Negi was the third Indian to win the Victoria Cross Duringour attack on the German positions he was one of a bayonet party whichentered a main trench Pushing on in advance of his fellows the gallantIndian bombed the enemy from traverse to traverse and at last forcedthem to surrender Unhappily he did not live to wear the covetedhonour but fell in a later stage of the engagementCorporal William Anderson 2nd Battalion Alexandra Princess of WalessOwn Yorkshire RegimentOn 12th March at Neuve Chapelle Corporal Anderson led three men armedwith bombs against a large party of the enemy then in possession of oneof our trenches After he had thrown his own bombs he found that histhree comrades had been shot down and that he was alone amongst theGermans Nothing dismayed he took the bombs of the three wounded menhurled them against the foe then opened rapid fire upon them and byhis prompt and determined action kept back the Germans until hiscomrades arrived and drove them from the trenchPrivate E Barber 1st Battalion Grenadier GuardsDuring the fighting round Pietre Mill on 12th March Private Barber whowas one of a grenade company ran ahead of his fellows and threw bombson the enemy with such effect that a large number of them at oncesurrendered When his comrades reached him they found him quite aloneand unsupported with Germans holding up their hands all around himCompany SergeantMajor Harry Daniels and Acting Corporal Cecil ReginaldNoble both of the 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade Prince Consorts OwnOn 12th March the 2nd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade was held up byentanglements near Pietre Mill and was subjected to a heavy machinegunfire SergeantMajor Daniels volunteered to go forward and cut the wireCome along he called to his chum Corporal Noble and without amoments hesitation the two men rushed across the forty yards thatseparated them from the obstacle Lying on their backs they cut thelower wire and thus opened a gap for their comrades to proceed Abullet struck Daniels in the thigh and a few minutes later he heard agasp and called out Whats up Noble replied I am hit in thechest old man and became unconscious Shortly afterwards he diedDaniels dragged himself to a shell hole where he remained until duskand then painfully made his way back to his own lines When interviewedin a London hospital he had little to say about his own exploit butwas full of admiration for the gallantry of his dead friend Noble andI he said had done everything together since we went out inNovember I trusted him and he trusted me It was hot work but theworst moment was when I heard my poor chum call out that he was hit inthe chest I am more glad about Nobles VC than I am about my ownThe exploit of these two brave men recalls that of the famous Swisspatriot Arnold von Winkelried at the Battle of Sempach 1386 Anunbroken line of Austrian lances barred the way of the Swiss whereuponWinkelried determined to sacrifice himself in order that his comradesmight break through  Make way for Liberty he cried    Then ran with arms extended wide    As if his dearest friend to clasp    Ten spears he swept within his grasp   Make way for Liberty he cried    Their keen points crossed from side to side    He bowed amongst them like a tree    And thus made way for LibertyCaptain Charles Calveley Foss DSO 2nd Battalion Bedford RegimentAt Neuve Chapelle Captain Foss turned failure into victory The enemyhad captured part of our trenches and our counterattack which wasmade with one officer and twenty men failed all but two of the partybeing killed or wounded Seeing this Captain Foss with eight men dashedforward through a fierce fire and began pelting the enemy with bombsSo successful was his attack that he recaptured the position and withit no less than fiftytwo Germans No words of mine are needed to extolthe splendid bravery of Captain Foss and his gallant

won the highest award ofvalour during the first day of the great battle at Neuve ChapelleNoticing that a large number of Germans were outflanking an advancedcompany of his regiment he dashed forward without waiting for ordersand flung bombs amongst the enemy with such effect that they were forcedto retire His prompt bravery undoubtedly saved the advanced companyfrom disaster Later in the day he performed a similar feat but whileengaged in this heroic work was shot through the heart He was a nativeof Derby and was thirtyfour years of age When the war broke out hehad completed twelve years of

saw the beginning and the end of a campaign which will godown to history as a splendid failure Aided by the French the Britishstrove to force a rightofway through the narrow and strongly fortifiedchannels which give access from the Mediterranean Sea to the southernshores of Russia Two attempts were madethe one naval the othermilitarybut both were fruitless Ships of war strove to batter downthe forts that commanded the channels but had to retire discomfitedThen an army was landed on the Gallipoli peninsula and a desperateeffort was made to take the forts from the rear The army was set analmost impossible task yet it very nearly achieved the impossible Menstill live who surmounted the last great obstacle that lay between themand victoryHow the British and French landed on narrow beaches in the face ofsuperior numbers of the enemy how they fought their way up the cliffsin spite of artillery machine guns and entrenched infantry how withsuperb courage and dogged endurance they established themselves on thepeninsula how they sacrificed themselves like the Spartans of old infierce assaults on the ridges and high hills that barred the way totheir goal and how finally they withdrew to their ships without theloss of a single lifeall this is a story which no Briton can readwithout mingled pride and pain pride in the men of his race who noblyfought and died in the hopeless struggle pain that so much bright andgallant life should have been given in vainHenceforth the Gallipoli peninsula is sacred ground The bones of tensof thousands of our gallant fellows lie buried in its soil In days tocome when wandering Britons shall sail by its peaceful shores theywill hush their voices and think tenderly of those who sleep their lastsleep amidst its rugged hills and deep ravines It will be strangetoo if a prayer does not arise from their hearts that the Empire mayever be defended by men of such matchless valour and lofty devotion                           Before I describe the Dardanelles and the great naval attack on itsforts you must understand why we undertook the enterprise It was ofcourse to assist the Russians who in the early months of 1915 wererunning short of big guns rifles and ammunition and were unable tosupply their needs by means of their own workshops The Allies wished tohelp them but were prevented from doing so to any great extent becauseRussia in Europe is cut off from the open sea on all sides except in theextreme north where the coast fronts the Arctic Ocean The only port towhich the Allies could send munitions was Archangel which for aboutnine months of the year is frozen up During the winter it wasimpossible for our ships to enter the harbour of Archangel at all Evenif Archangel had been open matters would have been but little improvedfor only a single line of railway connected this remote andevilsmelling port with the interior[31]Russia has a good deal of coast and many excellent harbours at theeastern end of the Baltic Sea but our trading ships could not enterthat sea because the Germans held the upper hand in it Their warshipslay in wait for all vessels coming through the narrow Danish channelsThe only remaining sea coast of Russia in Europe lies along the icefreeBlack Sea but in order to reach its shores ships must traverse thenarrow sea lane of the Dardanelles cross the Sea of Marmora and threadthe strait of the Bosporus When Turkey took the side of Germany thisroute was closed Then the only way by which the Allies could send gunsand rifles and ammunition to Russia was to carry them by sea to one ofthe Siberian ports on the Pacific Ocean where they were transferred tothe Siberian railway and carried right across North Asia to RussiaBefore a British or a French shell could reach Poland or Galicia it hadto make an eight or nine weeks voyage to the East and a railwayjourney of more than five thousand milesNow I think you understand why it was so vastly important that we shouldtry to force a rightofway through the Dardanelles Until this was donethe Allied armies in the East and in the West were more completely cutoff from each other than if they had been fighting in differenthemispheres It was impossible to send reinforcements from one to theother without carrying them almost round the globe Further theoverseas trade of Russia was terribly hampered by the blocking of theBaltic Sea and the Black Sea Millions of bushels of wheat lay rottingin the warehouses of the Black Sea ports and vast sums of money werebeing lost because they could not find an outlet If Constantinoplecould be captured the Turks could be ejected from Europe and theirarmies rendered powerless When this happened Greece and Bulgaria wouldno longer listen to the tempting voice of the German So you see thatthe forcing of the Dardanelles was of the utmost importance to theAllies It was felt that once we had a clear road to South Russia theend of the war would be in sight                           Roughly speaking the waterway between the Mediterranean Sea and theBlack Sea resembles a narrow glass tube with a bulb blown in the middleof it The Dardanelles forms the first part of the tube the bulb is theSea of Marmora and the remaining part of the tube consists of theBosporus or Ox Ford The Dardanelles or the Hellespont as it wascalled in ancient times extends for 45 miles the Sea of Marmora is 175miles in length and the Bosporus continues the waterway for another 17miles On a clear day it is said that from a hill on the shores of theDardanelles one may look right across the Sea of Marmora and beholdConstantinople nearly two hundred miles awayNow let us suppose that we are making a voyage from the gean Sea to theSea of Marmora in times of peace When we enter the strait we find thatit resembles a wide river rather than an arm of the sea and this is notsurprising for the channel is nothing but the bed of a river that wassubmerged in faroff days The channel is only about two and a halfmiles wide and we can clearly see the shores on either side of us Onour right is Asia on our left is Europe Along the line of thiswaterway East and West have met since the days when the world wasyoungAlmost every mile of the Asiatic shore of the Dardanelles recallsmemories of the song and story of ancient days We have scarcely enteredthe strait before we see on the Asiatic side the Kum Kale fort andbehind it the classic ground on which stood the famous city of Troy Iam sure you remember how Paris carried off the lovely Queen Helen toTroy and how Homers heroes fought for ten long years before the citywas captured and she was recovered and carried back by her husband toher home in Greece Modern historians however tell us that the TrojanWar was fought not for the fair face of Helen but because the king ofTroy almost closed the waterway by levying crushing duties on the goodsthat passed his shores It is strange to note that Britons and Frenchhave shed their blood at the Dardanelles in order that wheat from thefruitful lands bordering the Black Sea might pass freely to theMediterranean and so to the crowded cities of Western EuropeOn the eastern or Asiatic side we see sloping gardens and richvineyards and elsewhere there are low wooded hills but the western orEuropean side consists of a long unbroken line of barren cliffs We aregazing at the shores of the long and hilly Gallipoli peninsula whichyou will see from the map somewhat resembles a thumb bent at the jointAt the tip of the peninsula are the forts of Cape Tekke Cape Hellesand SeddulBahr These with the fort of Kum Kale which I have alreadymentioned guard the entrance to the DardanellesAs we proceed the Asiatic shore curves inland but the European shorecontinues straight and unbroken The strait now widens to a breadth offive miles but at Kephez Point it closes in to less than two milesAbout three miles further on the Narrows begin At one point theshores are not more than fourteen hundred yards apart and for about amile onward they are everywhere within a mile and a half of each otherEvery ship that sails from the Mediterranean Sea to the Sea of Marmoramust pass through this bottle neck[Footnote 31 During 1915 Russia was busy developing the icefree portof Alexandrovsk at the mouth of the river Kola but it was notavailable at the close of the year][Illustration The Dardanelles in Time of PeacePhoto Daily Mirror]  CHAPTER XXI  SHIPS VERSUS FORTSNo part of the Dardanelles is more famous in history than the NarrowsAcross the narrowest part of the Narrows Xerxes[32] flung his bridge ofboats when he set out to conquer Europe Herodotus the father ofhistory tells us that his Persians took seven days and seven nightsgoing continuously without any pause to cross the bridge A century anda half later Alexander the Great[33] rebridged the channel when hebegan his great march into Asia An old story tells us that every nightLeander used to swim the Narrows from the Gallipoli side to visit Herohis ladylove who dwelt at Sestos on the Asiatic side The lighthouseat Sestos guided him but one stormy night the light failed and Herowaited for him in vain Lord Byron swam the straits at this point in1810 It was on the Asiatic shore of the Narrows that St Paul heard thecry from Macedonia Come over and help usWe need not proceed further with our voyage The whole problem offorcing the Dardanelles centres on the Narrows Once they are safelypassed the broad deep Sea of Marmora is easily traversed and there isno obstacle between us and Constantinople But how to pass the NarrowsTheres the rub[Illustration A Turkish Fort on the Asiatic side of the entrance to theDardanellesPhoto Central News]You may be sure that the Turks jealously guard these narrow waters Asearly as 1460 forts were erected to defend them Now both sides of theNarrows fairly bristle with powerful forts in which big modern guns aremounted You have already heard that the forts are provided withsearchlights which play across the water at night and reveal themovements of even the smallest craft Not only are the shores studdedwith forts but batteries of big guns are concealed on the heightsbehind and hidden torpedo tubes are ranged along the waters edgeNature has also played her part in the defence of this dangerous anddifficult channel Swift currents sweep through the Narrows and notonly make navigation difficult but carry along drifting mines An enemywarship venturing into the channel must run the gauntlet of big guns onthe shore and deadly explosives in the sea While the defences remainintact the waterway is barred to her To reduce the forts wastherefore our first task                           I have already told you that when Britain declared war on TurkeyNovember 5th 1914 a long friendship was broken Our support of Turkeyarose out of our deep distrust of Russia now our good friend and loyalally We distrusted Russia because we knew that ever since the days ofPeter the Great she had coveted Constantinople and we feared that ifshe gained possession of that city our Far Eastern possessions would bethreatened We therefore threw in our lot with Turkey and more thanonce saved her from being wiped off the map of Europe During thepresent war we have reaped the bitter fruits of Turkish ingratitudeAbout the year 1840 it seemed clear that Turkey was going to pieces andthat the breakup of her empire was only a matter of time The TsarNicholas said to one of our ambassadors We have on our hands a sickmana very sick man It would be a great misfortune if one of thesedays he should slip away from us before the necessary arrangements havebeen made He therefore proposed to divide up the Turkish dominionstaking Constantinople for himself and offering us Crete and Egypt asour share of the spoils The bribe was of course refusedA few years later Greek and Latin priests quarrelled as to who shouldtake charge of the holy places in Palestine The Tsar Nicholas supportedthe Greeks and the French became the champions of the Latins Then theTsar put forward a claim that the Sultan should recognize him as theprotector of all Christians within the Turkish Empire This demand wasof course resisted and in 1853 Russian armies invaded Turkey We werenot in the least interested in the trivial dispute but we hated andfeared the prospect of the Russians in Constantinople Further as agreat trading nation we wished to keep the Dardanelles open forpeaceful commerce and we thought that this could best be done if thestraits remained in the hands of a weak Power such as Turkey So wejoined the French and fought the Russians in the Crimea We lost 24000men in the course of the war and added 41000000 to our nationaldebt but we prevented the Russians from overwhelming the TurksEven this poor success was not lasting Strife tumult and murderreigned in the Balkans under the cruel and blighting government of theSultan and twentyfour years later Russia again sent her armies intoTurkey The Russians drove back the Turks and early in 1878 they werewithin a short distance of Constantinople A cry of alarm andindignation broke out in England and people went about the Londonstreets shouting a popular song with the refrain The Russians shallnot take ConstantinopleSo strong was public feeling that a British fleet was ordered to theDardanelles The admiral was instructed to pass the straits and iffired upon and his ships struck to return the fire but not to wait tosilence the forts On February 13 1878 seven ships of war underAdmiral Hornby steamed up the Dardanelles The Turks manned the fortsat the Narrows but when the ships came up against a strong current andin the face of a blinding snowstorm they forbore to fire their gunsThere was an anxious moment when the Alexandra which led the lineran aground on the Asiatic side within easy range of Turkish batteriesShe was however unmolested and managed to get off after four hourshard work She then joined her consorts in the Sea of Marmora and theguns of the ships were trained on the domes and minarets of the TurkishcapitalNo doubt the presence of a British fleet within striking range ofConstantinople had its effect upon the Russians They did not enter thecity but agreed to make a treaty with the Powers by which SerbiaMontenegro and Rumania became independent states and Bulgaria wasgranted a form of Home Rule The Christian states which have been carvedout of Turkey in Europe owe everything to Russia As you know theChristians of the Balkans are Slavs and are akin to the Russians bothby race and religion Russia has always been their friend and championand Serbia and Montenegro have stood by their benefactor during thepresent war Rumania had so far determined to remain neutral butBulgaria as we shall learn later played a traitors part and beforethe year 1915 was out she had joined the Central PowersBritain has suffered greatly for her mistake in bolstering up the Turksand in preventing the Russians from becoming masters of ConstantinopleHad they been in possession of that city when the present war broke outthe work of overcoming the Germans and Austrians would have been shornof half its difficulty The Dardanelles would have been in the hands ofour friends and there would have been an open sea road by which Russiacould have carried on her overseas trade and received munitions andsupplies from her Allies There would have been no need for that navalattack on the forts of the Dardanelles which I am about to describe norshould we have undertaken that land campaign in the Gallipoli peninsulawhich cost us more than 117000 casualties and ended in failure onlyredeemed by the splendid gallantry of our men[Illustration Map of the Dardanelles]You have heard how Admiral Hornbys fleet threaded the Dardanelles in1878 without firing a shot Now let me tell you very briefly how aBritish squadron forced its way through the straits in spite of strongresistance In the year 1807 when we alone of all the European nationswere holding out against the French it was thought that if a Britishfleet were sent to Constantinople the Turks might be forced to breakwith Napoleon So a powerful squadron under Admiral Duckworth sailed forthe Dardanelles with orders to demand the surrender of the Turkishfleet If the demand was refused he was to bombard ConstantinopleThose were the days of sailing ships and it was not easy to getmenofwar and frigates up the narrow winding waters where the windswere irregular and the currents were baffling The castles at theentrance and the forts at the Narrows opened fire on the ships butlittle harm was done and they passed through and anchored offConstantinople It now seemed likely that under the muzzles of Britishguns the Sultan would give way The French agents however persuadedhim to play for time so that heavy batteries might be set up on theshores of the straits and Duckworths ships might be bombarded as theytried to return to the Mediterranean Duckworth you will notice was ina very tight place He was cut off from the open sea and he couldobtain no fresh supplies of food water or ammunition It was clearthat when his stores were exhausted he would be at the mercy of hisenemies So before he could come to any agreement with the Sultan hewas forced to retire His ships sailed slowly across the Sea of Marmoraand when the Narrows were reached the Turkish batteries opened fire withhuge balls of marble said to be hewn out of columns found amidst theruins of Troy One enormous stone shot cut the mainmast of the flagshipin two a second that hit another vessel knocked three gun ports intoone and killed or wounded sixty men Finally by good luck the shipsreached the open sea in safety All on board were convinced that theexperiment was too risky to be repeated                           Our greatest sailor Nelson always believed that strong heavily armedforts could resist the attack of ships When he was asked to reducecertain forts in Corsica by means of gun fire he pointed out that stonewalls were stronger than wooden walls and that redhot cannon ballsfrom the guns of the forts might set his ships on fire Since his daywooden walls have been replaced by armour plate and redhot shot byhighexplosive shells Nevertheless it is still true that shorebatteries are more than a match for the heaviest armed battleshipsafloat Of course weak or badlymanned forts have been overcome by theguns of ships as in the case of those at Alexandria which weresilenced by a British fleet in 1882 but as a rule ships run a greatrisk in attacking forts at close range and are more than likely to comeoff second bestWhile a fort can only be put out of action by gun fire a ship can besunk not only by gun fire but by mines or torpedoes Forts can bestrengthened to almost any extent and protected by earthworks of allkinds but there is a limit to the thickness and weight of the armourplate with which ships can be clad Further while shore batteries canbe so hidden that they cannot be detected even from aeroplanes a shipin action is in full sight of the fort and is thus a good target Thenagain hits made on the outer slopes of forts do but little damage Theonly hits that really count are those which destroy or dismount gunsand such direct hits are few and far between On the other hand everyshot that hits the ship is bound to tell and the ship may be put out ofaction without a single gun being hit You must also remember that whilethe fortress gunner is aiming at a wall twenty or thirty feet high and ahundred feet long the ships gunner can only fire at a low mound or ata battery not more than four and a half feet in heightEven more difficult is the task of a ships gunner when he is aiming atforts or batteries on high ground It is not easy for a naval gun tobring an effective fire to bear on a target at a high level above thesea Batteries on rising ground are difficult to reach and when theyare spotted they can be shifted to other positions in which case theships gunners have to find the range all over again When the shellsfrom the ships guns strike the ground they throw up columns of dustand it is difficult for observers on board the ship or in the air to seeexactly where the shells fall but shells from the forts or landbatteries drop into the sea and throw up fountains of water which areclearly visible and enable the observers on land to discover and setright all errors of rangeA ship attacking a fort from the sea may silence it for a time but whenthe ship draws off as it is bound to do the fort may be repaired andnew guns may be mounted Unless a landingparty goes ashore and utterlydestroys the fort there is no guarantee that the ships work will nothave to be done all over again Even if forts are blown up landbatteries can be established and resistance can be continued Withoutland forces to occupy the shores on which the forts are situated noreally lasting result can be obtained by the shipsNow that you understand the disadvantages under which a fleet attacksforts you will naturally ask why the British Government only sent shipsto break down the defences of the Dardanelles Why was not an armylanded on the Gallipoli peninsula to get behind the forts or toattack them in the rear while the ships bombarded them from the sea Inthe first weeks of February we were not ready to fit out and send asufficiently strong army to the Gallipoli peninsula Why then were thenaval attacks not postponed until the army was ready Probably it wasthought that if we hastened to show our strength in Near Eastern watersGreece Bulgaria and perhaps Rumania might be won over to our sideor at least persuaded to turn a deaf ear to the tempting voice of theKaiser Further some of the rulers of our navy really believed that thearmament of our warships was now so powerful that the straits could becarried by gun fire alone The idea of our Admiralty was to silence theforts at the entrance to the straits then with a fleet of minesweepersfrom the North Sea to clear the inner waters so that warships couldsteam sufficiently near to the forts at the Narrows to concentrate afierce fire on them When they were silenced the ships would dashthroughBut even supposing the forts could be thus silenced and our warshipscould slip through the straits what then So long as the Turks held theshores they could repair the damage to their forts mount new batteriesstrew the waters with mines and take a heavy toll of our ships whenlack of supplies forced them to return Those who planned this navalattack probably thought that the Turks would give in as soon asConstantinople was shelled But such a happy ending to the adventure wasvery doubtfulSo you see that unless the ships were supported by land forcessufficient to hold at least one of the shores of the straits all theefforts of the fleet were likely to prove fruitless Nevertheless anunsupported naval attack was decided upon and this was the first of themany costly mistakes which were made at the Dardanelles When our shipsbegan bombarding the forts the Turks and their German advisers knewthat we should have to make a land attack sooner or later With feverishhaste they therefore began to dig trenches and make gun pits on theGallipoli peninsula Thus the Turks were afforded a breathing space inwhich to make any future land operations doubly difficult[Footnote 32 King of ancient Persia from 485 to 465 BC He crossed theNarrows with a vast army in 481 BC][Footnote 33 King of Macedonia from 336 to 323 BC He conquered allWestern Asia and even the north of India As a soldier few of the greatgenerals of history can compare with him]  CHAPTER XXII  HOW WE FAILED AT THE NARROWSAs far back as November 3 1914 a British and French squadron ofbattleships and battle cruisers shelled the forts which guard theentrance to the Dardanelles both on the Gallipoli and the Asiatic sideThe attack was not long sustained each ship only fired about twentyrounds The forts replied but most of the shots fell short The soleobject of this brief bombardment was to get the range of the forts Aspectator noticed that while the firing continued a heavy haze of smokehung over the Turkish positions and columns of dust rose high into theair making spotting very difficultThree months elapsed before the real attack began On February 9 1915five British warships the Inflexible Agamemnon CornwallisVengeance and Triumph along with the French cruisers BouvetSuffren and Gaulois and a flotilla of destroyers turned theirguns on the entrance forts once more Behind the battle line lay theArk Royal a mother ship for seaplanes The aircraft which ascendedfrom her decks carried observers whose duty it was to direct thegunnery Longrange firing began at eight in the morning and beforelong the forts seemed to be smothered in bursting shells Hits werefrequently made both on the forts at Cape Helles and at Kum Kale on theopposite shore but what happened to the low earthworks of the batteriesat SeddelBahr was difficult to ascertain The forts did not reply andAdmiral Carden who was in command of the bombarding fleet thought thatthey must be out of action Shortly before three in the afternoon heordered six of his ships to close in and bring all their guns to bearon the forts As they did so the silent batteries awoke to life andshells fell fast and thick around the attacking vessels The Turkishfire however was badly aimed and not a single ship was hit Bysundown the Gallipoli batteries were again silent but Kum Kale wasstill firing when dusk began to fall and Admiral Carden had towithdraw his fleet for the nightNext day there was bad weather which continued for a week and theattack could not be resumed until the 25th The Queen ElizabethAgamemnon Irresistible and Gaulois pounded the forts at such along range that the guns on shore could not reach them At the end of anhour and a half the Queen Elizabeth had silenced the forts at CapeHelles but not before the Agamemnon had been struck by a shell whichkilled eight men and wounded five others Under the protection of thesuperDreadnoughts fire the Vengeance and Cornwallis now steamedin to complete the destruction of the forts Meanwhile theIrresistible and the Gaulois had severely hammered the Kum Kalebatteries and the Suffren and Charlemagne were told off to put thefinishing touches to the work of their bigger sisters By 515 thatevening all the forts at the entrance to the Dardanelles were rubbishheaps The Turkish gunners had fought pluckily for seven hours againstoverwhelming odds and their defeat brought them no discredit So farthe naval attack had been quite successfulWhen the ships ceased fire North Sea trawlers began the business ofminesweeping As you know it is dangerous and difficult work but itwas admirably done and by the morning of the 26th the first four milesof the straits were clear of mines and all was ready for an attack onthe inner forts The Albion Vengeance and Majestic now steamedup the straits to the limit of the mineswept waters and began tobombard Fort Dardanos on the Asiatic side The fort replied as alsodid certain concealed batteries at various points along the shore Oncemore the aim of the Turkish gunners was uncertain and the shipssuffered no damage The guns of the ships dispersed several bodies oftroops behind the fortsMeanwhile landingparties of Royal Marines were sent ashore to blow upthe forts which had been silenced on the previous day Everywhereexcept at Kum Kale this was successfully done The parties which landedon the Asiatic side were stubbornly resisted They fought a hot littlefight with the Turks and had to fall back to their boats with a fewcasualties Next day the Turks falsely announced that they hadeverywhere beaten off our landingparties with heavy lossThe entrance to the straits was now in our hands but its capture wasonly the beginning of the task I have already told you that the maindefences of the Dardanelles consist of the clustering forts andbatteries on both sides of the bottle neck known as the Narrows Ourships had now to deal not only with these forts and batteries but withdrifting mines and hidden torpedo tubes Their hour of trial was fastapproaching Strong and bitterly cold northerly winds postponed theattack until 4th March but in the meantime the trawlers under cover ofthe destroyers swept another five miles of the straits up to within amile and a half of the beginning of the NarrowsOn 4th March the ships were again in action and another attempt wasmade by the Marines to land at Kum Kale Once more they found a strongbody of Turks awaiting them and had to retire to their boats with aloss of nineteen killed twentyfive wounded and three missing Many ofthe men were killed by snipers concealed in the ruins or in trees Amidshipman of the Ocean tells us that a sergeant of Marines was foundpierced by fourteen bullets His comrades searched round until theyfound a German concealed in a wood exactly opposite to the wounded manHe was put up against a tree and shot without a wordNext day a squadron of battleships and cruisers began the bombardment ofSmyrna the chief city of Asia Minor and one of the greatest ports inthe Turkish Empire Some thirtytwo hits were made on the forts whichmade no reply The attack was renewed on several of the following daysbut with no result Probably it was never intended to be serious andwas only made to distract the attention of the enemyOn the morning of 6th March the forts at the Narrows were assaulted byships well up the straits The attacking vessels were frequently hit byshells but no serious damage was done and there was no loss of lifeThe bombardment from the inside of the straits was not the main attackThat was made by the Queen Elizabeth Agamemnon and Ocean fromthe Gulf of Saros The ships lay off the point of Gaba Tepe and underthe direction of aeroplanes hurled their shells on to the forts atChanak which you will see on the Asiatic side of the Narrows twelvemiles away The great 15inch guns of Big Lizzie as the bluejacketsdubbed the monster battleship fired twentynine rounds and playedhavoc with the forts A shell from the Lizzie blew up the powdermagazine of one of the batteries You must not suppose that the ships inthe Gulf of Saros went unmolested The Turks had concealed guns on theheights of the peninsula and with them they made good practice TheLizzie was hit three timesThe attack now seemed to be proceeding favourably Every day newspaperreaders at home expected to hear that the forts at the Narrows had beensilenced and that the guns of the fleet were within range ofConstantinople Little real progress however was being made Oftenwhen forts ceased fire we flattered ourselves with the belief that theyhad been destroyed What had really happened was that the heavy fumesfrom our shells had driven the gunners out of their casemates As soonas the air became clear again they returned to work their guns oncemore Even at SeddelBahr and Kum Kale our success was not complete Wehad blown up the forts but we had not occupied the ground on both sidesof the entrance and the Turks had strongly entrenched themselves nearat hand and had mounted guns which were able to continue theresistanceOn the night of 13th March the small light cruiser Amethyst performeda very daring feat She dashed into the Narrows and attempted to rushthrough Concealed batteries opened fire on her and she was hit severaltimes at close range Before she could run back into safety some fiftyof her men had been knocked over At home it was reported that she hadactually succeeded in passing the forts and everybody hoped that thebeginning of the end was in sight By this time an enormous number ofvessels of all sorts and sizes had been mustered Never before had sucha fleet been seen in Eastern waters Amongst the newcomers was theRussian cruiser Askold which our sailors called the packet ofWoodbines because of her five slim funnels On 18th March AdmiralRobeck who had succeeded Admiral Carden in command of the fleet feltthat the time had come for a big effortThursday 18th March broke bright and clear with a light wind and acalm sea At a quarter to eleven the Queen Elizabeth InflexibleAgamemnon and Lord Nelson supported by the Triumph andSwiftsure steamed up the bright blue waters of the straits and beganfiring at long range on the batteries on both sides of the NarrowsForts batteries howitzers and field guns replied and after thebombardment had lasted an hour and a half a French squadron of fourships including the Bouvet steamed in to attack the enemy at closerange Ten ships were now hurling their missiles on the forts and underthis terrific bombardment they were powerless to reply Then a Britishsquadron of six ships came up to push the attack home As this squadronsteamed towards Chanak the French ships were withdrawn from the narrowwaters in order to make room for the newcomers Suddenly while thismovement was going on the forts began to fire again It was now clearthat they had not been seriously injured by our heavy bombardmentAs the Bouvet retired an officer on a British destroyer saw threeshells strike her Almost at the same moment she blew up with a terrificexplosion and was hidden in a dense cloud of smoke In three minutesshe heeled over and disappeared A consort rushed to her assistanceonly to find bubbles rising to the surface and a pall of black smokeslowly lifting Out of her crew of 630 only 64 were saved At first itwas thought that the enemys shells had destroyed her but the realcause of the disaster was a floating mine The Turks seeing the narrowwaterway full of ships had dropped mines in the channel and thecurrent had swept them along on their mission of destructionThis grave misfortune led to no slackening of the bombardment An hourand a half later the Irresistible a British battleship thirteenyears old also fouled a mine She began to list heavily and slowlydragged her way from the firing line towards the entrance to thestraits At ten minutes to six she sank but happily not until ourdestroyers had taken off nearly all her ships company The rescue ofthe Irresistibles crew was a very gallant and skilful bit of workfor the destroyers were under Turkish fire all the time A midshipmannamed Hugh Dixon did splendid service in picking up officers and menwhile shells were falling round his boat He afterwards received theDistinguished Service Cross[Illustration The Irresistible and the Ocean in ActionBy permission of The Illustrated London NewsThis picture taken from the deck of a British warship shows theIrresistible and Ocean shelling the Kum Kale and other forts on theAsiatic side Both vessels were sunk on March 18 1915 by driftingmines See page 175]The tale of disaster was not yet complete A quarter of an hour afterthe Irresistible went down the floating mines claimed another victimThe Ocean a British battleship fifteen years old suddenly sank butonce more the destroyers were on the alert and few lives were lostNor had other ships of the fleet escaped scathless The Gaulois hadbeen holed in the bows the firecontrol station on the Inflexiblesforetop had been shot away and several of her men had fallen Later inthe day she received a gaping wound from a mineWhen the sun set on that disastrous day the fleet slipped out of theDardanelles never again to renew its attack in force The great attempthad failed three battleships had gone down and the French and Britishnavies were the poorer by the loss of many gallant men It was now clearto all that an unsupported naval attack was powerless to force arightofway through the Hellespont Though the lost battleships hadbeen destroyed by mines the wisdom of our forefathers had been fullyjustified wellarmed forts are more than a match for the gun fire ofshipsFor the next month one or more vessels entered the straits each day andopened fire in order to prevent the Turks from repairing their forts On28th March the Russian Black Sea Fleet bombarded the outer forts of theBosporus There was however no sting in these attacks The fleet hadshot its bolt Our war lords were now preparing for a combined movementby land and sea                           The Victoria Cross was awarded to LieutenantCommander Eric GascoigneRobinson for several acts of bravery during the operations describedabove On 26th February when detailed to destroy a fort which had beensilenced by our ships he advanced alone under heavy fire into theenemys position and blew up a 4inch gun He then returned to hisparty for another charge with which he destroyed a second gun He didthe work singlehanded because he knew that the white uniforms of hiscomrades would make them a good mark for the enemy Commander Robinsondistinguished himself not only by destroying guns but also by takingpart in four attacks on minefieldsin each case under heavy fire  CHAPTER XXIII  THE STORY OF HILL 60Three miles south of Ypres close to the railway line which runs fromthat city to Comines on the Lys stands Hill 60 now known to all theworld as the scene of a furious struggle which merged into a long andfierce battle You must not imagine Hill 60 as a towering peak but as agentle swell of ground not rising much more than sixty feet above thelevel of the surrounding country It was indeed formed by the earthtaken out of a railway cutting and dumped down by the side of the lineAt the time when my story opens 17th April it was a hillock ofploughed land with woods on all sides of it Humble as it was theheroisms done on it have given it a fame that Mont Blanc might envyHill 60 was valuable to the Germans because it overlooked the lowerground on which the British had dug their trenches Observers on thehill could watch what was going on down below and direct the fire oftheir heavy guns which were stationed a couple of miles or so to therear The whole hill was seamed with trenches and saps The Germans heldthe upper slopes and the summit and their positions were only fiftyyards away from those of the British They had strongly fortified thehill because they knew that its loss would force them to give up alarge part of their line For this reason and because it would affordus a gun position commanding much of the German front we now prepared abold attack upon itSince the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and the counterattack at St Eloithere had been a lull in the fighting Of course the big guns on bothsides fired daily and the aeroplanes of friend and foe made constantraids and observation flights but the infantry had been but littleengaged On 1st April an Allied aviator played a practical joke on theGermans He flew over Lille and dropped a football on theaerodrome[34] It bounded up to a great height and the Germansthinking that it was a new kind of bomb at once scuttled away intocover The supposed bomb did not explode and after a time they venturedout to examine it and discovered this inscription on it AprilfoolGott strafe England[35]In the early days of April our engineers all unknown to the enemy werebusy driving galleries under Hill 60 and preparing mines At sevenoclock on the morning of 17th April when the 1st Royal West Kents andthe 2nd Kings Own Scottish Borderers were waiting with fixed bayonetsthe mines under the hillock were exploded There was a terrific roarand it seemed as though the German trenches had been struck by anearthquake Parapets sandbags wire entanglements and the bodies ofthe men were blown high into the air The trenches disappeared and inplace of them yawned huge craters and mounds of piled earth Before thedense columns of dust and smoke could subside our guns belched forthshrapnel and highexplosive shells so as to prevent the enemy fromsending up reinforcements In the midst of the whirlwind of shot andflame the Germans who had survived the explosions were seen falling overone another in their efforts to escape by means of the communicationtrenches They were so panicstricken that some of them forced a way tosafety by charging through their own ranks with the bayonetThen the whistles blew and the West Kents closely followed by theScottish Borderers clambered over their parapets and rushing up theslope took possession of the craters while some of their comradespursued the flying Germans and fought furiously with them in the narrowtrenches Barricades were erected in the communication trenches andover these the enemy flung hand grenades The British however madegood their hold on the craters and twenty minutes after the charge wasmade were strongly posted with machine guns on the coveted positionHill 60 was ours[Illustration Hill 60From a sketch made just before its capture by the British Bypermission of The Illustrated London News]Early next morning Sunday 18th April the Germans in mass formationmade two attacks on the hill but they were mown down by machine gunsand shrapnel Nevertheless they kept up their assaults all day and by 6pm had won back part of the southern edge The 2nd West Riding and 2ndYorkshire Light Infantry were now sent up to relieve the West Kents andScottish Borderers Supported by heavy artillery fire they dashedforward and drove out the enemy at the point of the bayonet While doingso they captured fiftythree prisoners including four officers Duringthis advance we lost heavily but the Germans lost more and the slopeswere littered with the bodies of friend and foeFor three days the struggle continued almost without pause The Germansfiercely shelled the hill and hurled upon it a constant shower ofbombs Our men were exposed to fire from three sides but they held onlike limpets to a rock On the evening of the 20th the Germans madeanother infantry attack which lasted for an hour and a half but oncemore they were repulsed by the stubborn British It was during thisperiod of fighting that Lieutenant George Roupell and Second LieutenantGeoffrey Woolley won the Victoria Cross as you will read on a laterpageAt dawn the next morning we discovered that the Germans had dugthemselves in on the northeast edge of the hill In the afternoon theywere driven off and then their artillery literally plastered the hillwith shells of all kinds some of them containing gases which blindedand choked our men Against a tiny table top of 250 yards long by 200yards deep tons of metal and high explosives were flung from howitzersand field guns at close range It seemed to observers that nothing couldlive in that zone of fire nevertheless the defenders hung on for fourand a half terrible days The hill was still ours on Thursday the 22ndThen came a lull the storm of battle had begun to rage over a far widerfieldThe struggle for the hill did not cease with the opening of this newbattle Before every big attack which the Germans made elsewhere theydelivered a furious assault on the hill At length on 6th May after aseries of gas attacks they won it back and also some trenches to thenorth of it By this time however it had been so blown away by mineexplosions and artillery fire as to be of little value A friend ofmine who visited it a week later could barely detect the gentle swellamong the flat meadows                           Before I pass on to describe the Second Battle of Ypres let me relatesome soldiers stories of the fierce fighting on Hill 60 Acorrespondent tells us that the Scottish Borderers never lost heartduring the awful bombardment to which they were subjected Theseastounding men he says holding hastilydug trenches by the side of ayawning crater full of dead and wounded with highexplosive shellsbursting all around them and often falling amongst them actually sangas they fired over the parapets or lobbed their bombs over the barriersacross the old communication trenches of the Germans Amid the flaresthat lit up the hilltop as clear as day and the shells that burst withclouds of whitish yellow smoke they shouted in chorus Here we areHere we are Here we are again Thus a company of the West Kents sentup in support found them at daybreak The Borderers had been obliged tofall back from the trench on the outer lip of the crater to a trench onits near side so that the chasm lay between them and the Germans Theircaptain lay stark and stiff in the crater which was so full of dead andwounded that in the words of a West Kents officer hardly a portionof the ground could be seen Its dogged as does it according tothe old saying and never were men more dogged than the Kings OwnScottish Borderers during that fearful ordeal                           The same correspondent gives us some details of the splendid advancemade by the Duke of Wellingtons Own 2nd West Riding and the 2ndYorkshire Light Infantry when they drove the Germans off the southernedge At six oclock the Dukes as full of fight as ever withbayonets fixed were away over the parapet of their battered trenchfollowed by their fellowcountrymen of Yorkshire some of theKOSBs and the Queen Victoria Rifles a London Territorialbattalion that did magnificent work that day B Company of the Dukeson the right reached the German trenches with only slight casualtiesC company in the centre had to cross open ground and of the hundredmen who charged only Captain Barton and eleven others got into theGerman trench where notwithstanding their small numbers they killedor routed all the Germans there D Company on the left had likewiseto traverse the open and lost all its officers in passing through theheavilyshelled zone but with the help of the gallant Yorkshire LightInfantry it managed to secure the trench Some fine deeds of gallantrywere performed on that sombre hillside Privates Behan and Dryden ofthe Dukes became separated from their company but charged a Germantrench singlehanded killing three Germans and capturing two othersWhen they were reinforced by a detachment without an officer Behan tookcommand and showed great ability Both men afterwards received theDistinguished Conduct Medal                           A Gaspipe Officer[36] writing in Blackwoods Magazine tells usthat on the evening of 17th April a group of officers standing on alittle rise watched the shrapnel bursting over Hill 60 three and a halfmiles away They were half joyful and half sick at heart Not one ofthem would have confessed it yet each had a great pride in the olddivision and a great anxiety that it should do well Had the chargebeen successful Had the gains been made good They went back into theirhut and sang    until it was time to go to bedIn the morning news came that the position had been rushed the Germanshad been filled with such panic that they had fled from the trenches oneither side of the crater they were heavily attacking their guns andbombs were sweeping the new position there was no wire down yetAbout nine the same night there was much cheering in the darkness ofthe camp The remains of two battalions had returned from the hill Thenfirst we learned the names of the fallen Still there was no wire down   It took five or six days before the wire was down and trenchesproperly made During those days no battalion could remain for more thanfifteen hours on the hill and at the end of its shift it would returnbroken The men could see the guns that were firing at them    Thehill was death But the 5th Division never let go They stuck to thehill while the sappers put up wire and made it defensible                           Before I close this chapter I will give you some account of the soldierswho won the Victoria Cross for deeds of outstanding gallantry during theperiod between the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and the beginning of theSecond Battle of YpresPrivate Robert Morrow 1st Battalion Princess Victorias Royal IrishFusiliersNear Messines on 12th April some of our trenches were destroyed by theenemys shell fire and several of our men were buried in the ruinsWithout waiting for orders and under a very heavy fire Private Morrowdug out the men and carried them one by one to places of shelter Ascore of times he hazarded his own life in rescuing his comrades andthe highest award of valour was the Kings tribute to such fearlessselfdevotionPrivate Edward Dwyer 1st Battalion East Surrey RegimentWhen His Majesty the King pinned the coveted cross on the breast ofPrivate Dwyer he was amazed at the boyish appearance of the hero Hewas but nineteen years of age when he ran through the hail of death upthe slope of Hill 60 yet he was already a veteran for he had foughtfrom Mons to the Marne and back to the Aisne and had played his partin many a Flanders battle He and his comrades of the East Surreys helda trench of Hill 60 with wonderful doggedness Quite early in theencounter Dwyer went out from the cover of his trench and bandagedseveral of his badlywounded comrades No one would have been moresurprised than Edward Dwyer if he had been told that these acts of mercywere heroic He considered them his plain dutythat was allDwyer and his comrades were assailed by German handgrenade throwersTheir bombs came hurtling into the trench and did awful executionDwyer saw that unless the Germans were beaten back with their ownweapons the position would be lost Seizing a supply of bombs he sprangupon the parapet and flung his missiles so rapidly and with suchunerring aim that he broke up the enemys advance At once he became amark for the enemys bombers and sharpshooters Standing high on theparapet he was an excellent target Grenades whizzed and cracked in theair around him rifles were fired at him and only by a hairs breadthdid he escape time after time At last he was wounded in the head buteven then he did not cease to fling his bombs They fell right in thethick of the Germans who were forced back One man had beaten back awhole companyPrivate Dwyer came down from the sandbags sorely wounded butvictorious He was still unaware that he had done anything heroic Butyou and I honour him as a supremely brave man who added to hisgallantry the charm of modesty While he was recovering from his woundshe addressed recruiting meetings with such burning words that many a manforthwith offered his services to his King and country Before the yearwas out he carried the Kings commission as second lieutenantLieutenant George Rowland Patrick Roupell 1st Battalion the EastSurrey RegimentThis young officer was in command of his company in a front trench onthat terrible April day when our men were clinging on to Hill 60 bytheir eyebrows Though wounded in several places he remained at hispost and led his men when they repelled a strong German assault Duringa lull in the shattering salvos of fire he had his wounds hurriedlydressed and then insisted on returning to his trench which was soonheavily shelled once more Towards evening when his company wasdangerously weakened he went back to headquarters through a whirlwindof fire and returned bringing with him reinforcements With these heheld the position until his battalion was relieved next morningLieutenant Roupell was one of the few survivors of his company It washis splendid example of courage devotion and doggedness that inspiredhis men to hold out to the endSecond Lieutenant Benjamin Handley Geary 4th Battalion attached 1stBattalion East Surrey RegimentSecond Lieutenant Geary held the left crater on Hill 60 with hisplatoon a detachment of the Bedfordshire Regiment and a fewreinforcements sent up during the evening and night The crater was soheavily bombarded by the enemy that the defences were broken down andthroughout the night there were repeated bomb attacks which filled thegreat hole with dead and wounded Each attack however was splendidlyrepulsed mainly owing to the personal gallantry and inspiring exampleof Lieutenant Geary At one time he used a rifle with great effect atanother time he threw hand grenades and held off the enemy Again andagain he exposed himself with entire disregard of danger in order tosee by the light of flares where the attack was to be made In thepauses between the attacks he was busy arranging for ammunition supplyand for reinforcements Lieutenant Geary displayed all the ancientvirtues of his racealertness in seizing opportunities courage that isheedless of self leadership that inspires confidence and steadfastnessthat never knows defeat He was severely wounded just before daylighton 21st April A bullet passed through his head from one side to theother completely destroying the sight of one eye and seriouslyinjuring that of the other He made however a rapid recoveryLieutenant Geoffrey Harold Woolley 9th County of London Battalionthe London Regiment Queen Victorias Rifles Territorial ForceAt one time during the frenzied struggle which I have described in thischapter Lieutenant Woolley was the only officer on the hill With ahandful of men he resisted all attacks on his trench and continuedthrowing bombs and encouraging his comrades until he was relieved Allthis time his trench was under heavy fire from the artillery bombersand machine gunners of the enemy For sticking it so gallantlyLieutenant Woolley was rightly awarded the cross of valour He had thehonour of being the first of all Territorials to win this highdistinction Lieutenant Woolley was the son of an Essex clergyman andwas a student at Oxford preparing to take holy orders when the warbroke out Although he confessed that he hated fighting he neverthelessfelt that he must serve his country Shortly after his exploits on thehill he was promoted captain[Illustration The first Territorial to win the VC An heroic Exploiton Hill 60From the picture by R Caton Woodville from material supplied by menwho fought in the action By permission of The Illustrated LondonNewsHe successfully resisted all attacks on his trench and continuedthrowing bombssuch was the exploit which won Lieutenant GeoffreyHarold Woolley the Victoria Cross You will read the story of hisheroism on page 187]Private Edward Warner 1st Battalion Bedfordshire RegimentOn 1st May the Germans launched a gas attack against Hill 60 and Trench46 had to be abandoned by our men Though suffering agonies from thepoisonous fumes Private Warner all by himself returned to the trenchand prevented the enemy from taking possession of it Reinforcementswere ordered up but they could not reach the gallant fellow owing tothe gas He then came back and returned with other men who helped himto hold the trench until the enemys attacks ceased By this time he wascompletely worn out and shortly afterwards died from the effects of gaspoisoning Thus perished a hero of heroes[Footnote 34 Aviation ground with hangars or sheds in which aeroplanesare stored][Footnote 35 German for God punish Englandthe common curse of theGermans at that time][Footnote 36 Military cyclists are known at the front as GaspipeCavalry]  CHAPTER XXIV  THE POISONOUS CLOUDWhile the Germans were fiercely shelling Hill 60 the tide of war rolledalong the Ypres Salient which has so often figured in these pages TheGaspipe Officer already quoted says The old Ypres salient was such asilly thing Imagine for a moment one of those old Greek theatressemicircular All the way round the Germans were on the top row ofseats and we were only halfway up They could see everything that wewere doing while we hemmed in had to trust to aeroplanes And down onthe floor of the theatre stood Ypres through which or by which nearlyevery road to the salient passedIf you look at the diagram on page 189 you will see how we were holdingthe salient on the morning of 22nd April Our lines ran in a semicirclefrom Steenstraate on the Yser canal about four and a half miles to thenorth of Ypres right round to the YpresComines canal about two milessouth of the city Nowhere was the salient more than four and a halfmiles across every part of it including Ypres itself was thereforewithin range of the enemys big guns As the Gaspipe Officer tells usthe Germans held the higher ground and were thus in a very favourableposition for sweeping all parts of the salient with their fire All theroads to the outer rim of the salient spread out from Ypres like thespokes of a wheel Our supply and ammunition columns were thereforeunder fire the moment they entered or passed by the cityThe British forces had greatly increased since those days of terribletrial in the preceding October and November when with never more than150000 men we had beaten back the furious onrush of at least half amillion Germans and had blocked for ever the coveted road to Calais Wehad now some 500000 men at the front and we felt after our greatassault at Neuve Chapelle that we had the upper hand of the enemy andthat henceforth the attack was with us and the defence lay with himBefore however he sank into this secondary position he meant to makeanother desperate effort to reach the Channel ports This long andfierce struggle which I am now about to describe is known as theSecond Battle of Ypres[Illustration Second Battle of YpresSketch showing position at the Ypres salient on the morning of April 221915]Look again at the diagram The Allied line from Steenstraate toLangemarck was held by Turcos and Spahis French colonial troops fromAlgeria Continuing the curve for 5000 yards was the Canadian Divisionconsisting of three infantry brigades in addition to artillerybrigades The first infantry brigade was in reserve the second 8th and5th Battalions lay on the right and the third 13th and 14thBattalions on the left next to the French The whole division wascommanded by General Alderson BrigadierGeneral Turner commanded the3rd Brigade and BrigadierGeneral Curry the 2nd Brigade The trencheswhich the Canadians had taken over from the French were badly made andvery wet and could only be improved with difficulty as the dead hadbeen buried in the bottoms and the sides The 28th Division continuedthe line to the southeast corner of Polygon Wood where PrincessPatricias Own were stationed From the wood to Hill 60 the remainder ofthe salient was manned by the 27th DivisionThough the salient was well known to be a source of weakness it was notstrongly held by the Allies at this time Probably the Germans wereaware of the fact for suddenly they launched a furious and determinedattack against the forces holding it The only warning which the Alliesreceived was on the 20th when the guns of the enemy began to bombardYpres Huge shells from the heaviest of guns fell in the streets whichwere then thronged with citizens and our own reserves Fifteen littlechildren were killed at their play and a number of the townsfolkperished amidst the ruins of their houses Our generals understood atonce the meaning of this bombardment It was meant to block the roads toour lines on the salient and make the work of sending forward suppliesand ammunition very difficult if not impossible It was not meant toembarrass us at Hill 60 for we had free roads leading to that positionfrom the west It could only be the forerunner of an attack on that partof the salient extending from the Yser Canal to the Menin roadthat ison the portion held by the French Colonials the Canadians the 28thDivision and Princess Pats Our generals viewed the bombardment withanxiety they knew that we were ill prepared to meet the attacks whichwere soon to followThursday 22nd April was a peaceful day warm and sunny A lightsteady wind was blowing from the northeast About five in the eveningan aviator reported that he had seen a strange green cloud higher thana man surging across the open ground from the German lines towards theFrench trenches It was the deadly poison gas chlorine which when takeninto the lungs sets up acute bronchitis and causes its victims to die inhorrible agony At every fifty feet or so along the German front abattery of twenty retorts had been established The gas from theseretorts had been pumped at high pressure into huge reservoirs from whichpipes ran to the front trenches When the nozzles were turned on thedeadly gas rushed out and was carried by the wind towards the Frenchlines Special respirators had been served out to the German soldierswho were waiting in readiness to take advantage of this foul blow Neverbefore had poison gas been used in this manner on the battlefield TheGermans were about to sound the deepest depths of their infamy and tryto poison those whom they could not beat in fair fightOnward rolled the greenishwhite cloud across fields through woodsand over hedgerows Soon the Turcos in their trenches were gasping andchoking and suffering unspeakable tortures They were brave men therewas no mortal foe they were not ready to engage but this creeping cloudthat struck them down in agony was a devilish magic which they couldneither understand nor resist A horrible unreasoning terror tookpossession of them and they ran Back they fled through the dusk acoughing blinded crowd leaving behind them hundreds of their comradesgasping out their lives or lying dead with blue faces and frothy lipsSome of them fled due south towards the Langemarck road and in theearly darkness came upon the reserve battalions of the Canadians whogazed in amazement upon their wild dark faces their heaving chests andspeechless lips Soon the Canadians began to feel the effects of thegas and many of them were afflicted by a deadly sickness[Illustration Stand to your ArmsBy permission of The SphereThe incident pictured above occurred when the Turcos were assailed bypoison gas and fled from their trenches When the first fugitivesarrived on the outskirts of Ypres some of our reserves gathered ingroups wondering what had happened and trying to find out what was thematter Suddenly a staff officer rode up shouting Stand to yourarms and in a few minutes the troops had fallen in and were marchingto the scene of the fight Nothing more impressive ran be imagined thanthe sight of our men falling in quietly and in perfect order amid thescene of wild confusion caused by the panicstricken refugees whoswarmed along the roads striving to flee as quickly as possible fromthe German menace behind them]A great breach four miles wide now yawned between Steenstraate andLangemarck On the left of the Canadians there was a huge rent throughwhich the Germans were preparing to advance while their artillerypitilessly whipped the fugitives onward The situation was dangerous inthe extreme Ypres appeared to be within the Kaisers grasp TheCanadians were unsupported on their left the French trenches werechoked with dead and dying and fifty French guns were in the hands ofthe enemy In vain the officers strove to rally the fleeing TurcosMeanwhile a great mob of Germans pushed through the wall of gas whichwas now breaking up into patches behind them and rushed on towardsYpres Only two miles of open country now separated them from the cityof their desire  CHAPTER XXV  THE BATTLE GLORY OF CANADAEvery Briton may thank God that the Canadians were where they were whenthe cloud of poison gas sent the Turcos fleeing in panic to the rearThese sons of the eldest daughter of the Empire who prior to the warknew little or nothing of the art and discipline of warfare were nowcalled upon to save the situation when all seemed lost They too hadbeen gassed and though they had not suffered so severely as theFrench many of them were already out of action Against the 3rdCanadian Brigade four divisions of Germans now flung themselves Theywere working round to the rear when General Turner threw back his leftflank until his line ran roughly thus[Illustration]This movement had to be carried out while the air was foul withpoisonous fumes while shells were bursting all around and bullets wereflying from scores of machine guns and hundreds of rifles By nightfallthe left wing of the 3rd Brigade was in its new position Then underthe flickering light of burning farmhouses and cottages and the fitfulrays of the moon the men dug themselves in and prepared to hold oncome what might By midnight two battalions of the reserve had beenbrought up and the Canadians had settled down to their desperate taskSo fierce was the German curtain of fire that no food could reach thetrenches for twentyfour hours and then only bread and cheese Acompany of the Buffs which attempted to bring relief was altogetherdestroyed                           The story of the Second Battle of Ypres is mainly the story of how theCanadian Divisionoutflanked and outnumbered by four to one stormedat with shot and shell by the heaviest artillery known to warfarestupefied by poisonous vapours unsupported by big guns unaided byreinforcements and short of food and waterfought through the day andthrough the night and then through another day and night losingheavily hour by hour but enduring gloriously and finally retiring withthe proud knowledge that by its superb endurance it had saved the day                           When the French Colonials fled from their trenches the enemy capturedfour British guns in the little wood which you see to the east of StJulien The teams were miles away and the guns could not be carried offduring the hurry and confusion of changing position It was gall andwormwood to the Canadians to think these guns should be lost and theywere eager to recover them Towards midnight Colonel Leckie and ColonelBoyle led the Canadian Scottish the 16th Battalion of the 3rd Brigadeand the 10th Battalion of the 2nd Brigade into the wood in a desperateendeavour to win back the guns Let me tell you the story of this finecharge in the words of an officer who took part in it    It wanted but a few minutes to midnight when we got to a hollow    which was at most three hundred yards from the wood The moon    now reappeared at intervals and we could have done without her    The shrapnel fire had completely ceased and we had a second    spell of a silence which could be felt    Whispered orders were given to fix bayonets which were obeyed    in a flash Overcoats packs and even the officers equipments    were dropped and we immediately advanced in light order    Scarcely had we reached a low ridge in full view of the wood    when a perfect hail of fire was loosed on us from rifles and    machine guns which the Germans had placed in position behind    the undergrowth skirting the wood    Instantly the word was given to charge and on we rushed    cheering yelling shouting straight for the foe At first the    Germans fired a little too high and our losses until we came    within fifty yards of them were comparatively small Then some    of our chaps began to drop then the whole front line seemed to    melt away only to be instantly closed up again    Cheering and yelling all the time we jumped over the bodies of    the wounded and tore on Of the Germans with the machine guns    not one escaped but those inside the wood stood up to us in a    most dogged style We were so quickly at work that those at the    edge of the wood could not have got away in any case Many threw    up their hands and we did not refuse quarter    Pressing on into the wood itself the struggle became a    dreadful handtohand conflict we fought in clumps and batches    and the living struggled over the bodies of the dead and dying    At the height of the conflict while we were steadily driving    the Germans before us the moon burst out The clashing bayonets    flashed like quicksilver and faces were lit up as by limelight    Sweeping on we came upon lines of trenches which had been    hastily thrown up and could not be stubbornly defended Here all    who resisted were bayoneted those who yielded were sent to the    rearAnother officer who took part in the attack described how the men abouthim fell under the fire of the machine guns which in his phraseplayed upon them like a wateringpot He added quite simply I wrotemy own life off But neither he nor his men wavered When one man fellanother took his place and with a final shout the two battalions flungthemselves on the wood The Germans were thrust back by the impetuousadvance of the Canadians who reached the far side of the wood and thereentrenched themselves They retook the guns but were sorelydisappointed to discover that the Germans had rendered them uselessThey also captured a number of prisoners including a colonelThat night a terrible artillery fire swept the wood as a tropical stormsweeps the leaves from a forest and the Canadians fell back from theposition which they had won at the price of many a brave life Allthrough the night the fighting went on without pause The attacksconstantly grew in strength and it seemed hardly possible that theCanadians could resist much longerAt six on the morning of Friday the enemy began an outflanking movementthat looked very dangerous In order to relieve the strain acounterattack on the first line of German trenches was ordered Thiswas carried out by the Ontario 1st and 4th Battalions of the 1stBrigade under General Mercer The advance was made across 2300 yardsof open country every yard of which was under hot shell fire    It is safe to say writes Sir Max Aitken the Canadian record    officer that the youngest private in the ranks as he set his    teeth for the advance knew the task in front of him and the    youngest subaltern knew all that rested on its success It did    not seem that any human being could live in the shower of shot    and shell which began to play upon the advancing troops    They suffered terrible casualties For a short time every other    man seemed to fall but the attack was pressed ever closer and    closer The 4th Canadian Battalion at one time came under a    particularly withering fire For a momentnot moreit wavered    Its most gallant commanding officer LieutenantColonel    Birchall carrying after an old fashion a light cane coolly    and cheerfully rallied his men and at the very moment when his    example had infected them fell dead at the head of his    battalion With a hoarse cry of anger they sprang forward for    indeed they loved him as if to avenge his death    The astonishing attack which followed pushed home in the face    of direct frontal fire made in broad daylight by battalions    whose names should live for ever in the memories of soldiers    was carried to the first line of the German trenches After a    handtohand struggle the last German who resisted was    bayoneted and the trench was wonThe Canadian left was now safe The German trench was occupied andheld against all comers in the teeth of every kind of deadly missilethat could be hurled against it It was still in the hands of thevictors on Sunday 25th April when all that remained of the warbrokenbattalions was relievedAt 4 am on the morning of Friday the 23rd the Germans sent a greatdischarge of poison gas against the 2nd Brigade which held the linerunning northeast and upon the 3rd Brigade which had continued theline up to the pivotal position and had then spread down in asoutheasterly direction In two minutes a cloud seven feet high rolledfrom the German trenches into those of the Canadians The defenders hadno respirators but some of them wrapped wet handkerchiefs about theirmouths and thus obtained a little relief They dared not retire evenif they had wished to do so for the gas would follow them and theexertion would cause them to draw deeper breaths of the deadly vapourSo with blue swollen faces and bloodshot eyes almost bursting fromtheir sockets they held on Men went sick and giddy a thousand yardsbehind the line and even the grass and trees grew white as the fumespassed over them[Illustration GassedFrom the picture by F Matania By permission of The SphereThe green mist came rolling towards the parapet from the enemys emptyfront trench several hundred yards away It looked like a vapour risingfrom a marsh and the wind was strong enough to carry it rapidly towardsthe parapet One battalion had time to fire two rounds through thescreen of gas before it came pouring over the sandbags penetratinginto every crevice of the dugouts and choking the men who lay thereIt was so thick at first that objects three feet distant could scarcelybe seen]Many of the men were struck down by the fumes and the Royal Highlandersof Montreal 13th Battalion and the 48th Highlanders 15th Battalionspecially suffered For a short time the 48th were obliged to withdraw ashort distance from their trench Soon however they were their own menagain and they advanced and reoccupied their old position The Germansas you know had long been striving to drive back the devoted 3rdBrigade in order to sweep round and overwhelm its left wing In thecourse of the attacks a large number of the enemy managed to slip inbetween the wood and St Julien For a time it seemed as though theGermans had succeeded and that the last obstacle to their advance wouldbe swept away Not only the men of the 13th Battalion but of everyother battalion fought like heroes to avert the danger All that mortalmen could do they did Major Norsworthy who had already been disabledby a bullet was bayoneted and killed while rallying his men MajorMCuaig who had been seriously wounded in a hastilyconstructed trenchinsisted on being left behind lest he should be a hindrance So fierceand constant were the German attacks that orders were now given for thebrigade to retireThe men were very unwilling to withdraw and they insisted at greatrisk on carrying with them their belongings A wounded officerfollowing the example of Major MCuaig refused to move and asked hiscomrades to leave him alone in the trench He begged them to give himtwo loaded Colt revolvers and with these and his own weapon ready athand he prepared to sell his life dearlyOn Friday afternoon the left of the Canadian line was strengthened bythe arrival of seven battalions of British troops But the artilleryfire of the enemy grew fiercer and fiercer and it was clear that theCanadian salient could not be held against the fierce and constantattacks which were being launched against it so slowly and stubbornlycontesting every yard of ground the defenders fell back upon StJulien and then still farther south until the deserted village washalf a mile in front of their new lines The Germans swarmed into thevillage but before they could call it their own they had to reckon withdetachments of the Royal Highlanders of Montreal and of the RoyalMontreal Regiment unavoidably left behind when the main body retiredWhat befell these devoted fellows in St Julien we shall probably neverknow but as the crack of their rifles did not cease for a long time wemay rest assured that they fought and died as worthy sons of CanadaThe success of the Germans in capturing St Julien threatened a new anddangerous attack by the enemy In order to check it a British brigadewas ordered to advance The thrust was made through the Canadian leftand centre and as the troops went forward many of them going tocertain death they broke out into loud cheers for Canada There was noman in the British army who was not filled with admiration for theCanadians that day The advance was very costly but it succeeded For atime the Germans were checkedNow let us see how the 2nd Brigade fared At five oclock on Thursday itwas still holding the whole of its original line of trenches Now thatthe 3rd Brigade had retired General Curry who was in command had todo as General Turner had donethat is throw back his left flank toprotect his rear It is the glory of the 2nd Brigade that they neverlost their trenches They hung on from Thursday at five oclock untilSunday afternoon Then there were no trenches left they had been wipedout by the German shell fire General Curry withdrew his unbroken andundefeated troops from the tumbled heaps of earth and sandbags but notbefore many a deed of heroism had been doneAt Grafenstafel the extreme northeastern point of the Ypres salientthe position was held by the 90th Winnipeg Rifles underLieutenantColonel Lipsett His battalion had been driven from itstrenches by gas early on Friday morning but in threequarters of anhour it had recovered itself and retaken its old quarters When the 3rdBrigade retired as described above a gap was left through which theGermans strove desperately to force their way Had they done so theywould have been in the rear of the 28th Division and the whole easternsection would have been in perilous plight Colonel Lipsett howeverheld on to this key to Ypres though his left was in the air and keptthe Germans out of the gap until the arrival of two British regimentsIt is said that Lieutenant Bellew a machinegun officer of the 7thstuck a loaf on his bayonet and hoisted it upon the parapet in defiancewhile he worked his gun It was smashed to pieces but he afterwardscontinued the fire with relays of rifles On Sunday evening the 2ndBrigade was relieved for muchneeded rest The 3rd Brigade had beenrelieved on the previous nightMonday morning broke bright and clear but it was a day of terribleanxiety and every man was needed in the firing line[Illustration The Fight in the Wood by Moonlight Canadian Scottish andthe 10th Infantry recapture lost guns at the point of the bayonetBy permission of the Illustrated London NewsInstantly the word was given to charge and on we rushed cheeringyelling shouting straight for the foe    Pressing on into the wooditself the struggle became a dreadful handtohand conflict we foughtin clumps and batches and the living struggled over the

by limelight Seepages 194 196]Monday morning broke bright and clear but it was a day of terribleanxiety and every man was needed in the firing line So the 2ndBrigade now less than a thousand strong was ordered back The men aretired said General Curry but they are ready and glad to go again tothe trenches They had to cross a zone of shell fire in daylight beforethey regained their old position and this was no easy task for men whohad lived through such shattering days They held the trenches all dayon Monday on Tuesday they were withdrawn to reserve trenches and onWednesday were relieved and retired to billets in the rearIn this account of a great and glorious feat of arms I have confinedmyself to the work of the infantry A word must be said as to thebehaviour of the other units The signallers proved themselves cool andresourceful During the fierce bombardment the telegraph and telephonewires were constantly cut and in carrying out the repairs many bravemen lost their lives The dispatch carriers as usual showed the utmostbravery One of them sore wounded gasped out his message to a passingofficer before swooning away The artillery never flagged and not asingle Canadian gun was lost in the long and confused battle On oneoccasion the gunners of a battery were compelled to swing two of theirguns round and to fire on the foe in front and in the rear at the sametime Canadian engineers and the medical corps also played a devotedpart and are entitled to share with their comrades of all arms in theglory of a great achievement                           So ended the great ordeal of the Canadians in the Second Battle ofYpres When the story of their glorious courage and endurance wasflashed across the sea Britons everywhere throughout the wide Empirewere thrilled with pride Consider for a moment what they had done Theyhad stemmed the onrush of an enemy which outnumbered them by four toone and they had done it in spite of the deadly poison gas that chokedand blinded and stupefied them They had no heavy artillery to assistthem they were without reinforcements they were unceasingly assailedthey held on for days and nights of incessant struggle and anxiety yetso undismayed were they that they could counterattack with fierycourage And when after enduring such trials they were called from abrief rest to reenter the zone of death they were glad to return SirJohn French confessed that by their gallantry and determination theyhad undoubtedly saved the situation While the British Empire can boastsuch men its future and its fame are secureMessages of congratulation were showered upon the gallant fellows Hereis the Kings message which was sent to the Duke of Connaught asrepresenting Canada    Congratulate you most warmly on the splendid and gallant way in    which the Canadian Division fought during the last few days    north of Ypres Sir John French says their conduct was    magnificent The Dominion will be justly proudGeorge                           Great was the price of victory Three battalion officers diedColonelBirchall of the 4th Colonel MHarg of the 7th and Colonel Boyle of the10th Only ten officers of the 5th Battalion survived only five wereleft alive in the 7th only seven in the 8th and eight in the 10thWhen the long fight was over the machine gunners of the 13th Battaliononly mustered thirteen out of fiftyeight and there was but a singlesurvivor of those attached to the 7th Battalion Up to 2nd May theCanadian Division had lost in killed wounded and missing 252 officersand 6332 men When the tale of losses was unfolded there were manybleeding hearts in Canada but mingled with the grief there was asorrowful pride and even those who had lost their dearest and best wereas resolute as ever to continue the struggle to a triumphant endThe graveyard of Canada in Flanders is large It is very large Thosewho lie there have left their mortal remains on alien soil To Canadathey have bequeathed their memories and their glory

OF STRUGGLE AND ANXIETYII have told you in the form of a continuous story how the Canadianssaved the day In doing so I have had to keep your attention fixed onthat part of the British line extending from Grafenstafel to the littlewood where the Canadians made their midnight charge in order to recoverthe lost guns We have now to learn what took place on the left andright of the Canadian position and to follow the fortunes of thelongdrawnout battle to its closeYou already know that when the poison gas rolled down on the Frenchtrenches and drove the panicstricken Turcos in headlong flight a greatbreach of four miles yawned in the Allied line By swinging back theirleft the Canadians barred a portion of this gap but only a portionFrom the little wood on which their left rested to the line of the YserCanal there was still an undefended gap of at least two and a halfmiles Had the Germans been prompt they could have marched through thisgap into Ypres almost without firing a shot Strange to say they wereslow in moving and did not push their advantage As in the First Battleof Ypres they broke our line but could do nothing in the breachNot until the small hours of Friday morning did the first Britishreinforcements arrive in the gap They had been drawn chiefly from the28th Division which was holding the line from Grafenstafel to PolygonWood All the battalions that could be spared from the 28th Divisionwere hurried across the salient and it was a strange mixture of unitsthat held the pass between the Canadian left and the canal As thefighting proceeded this force which was commanded by Colonel Geddesaltered its character from day to day and almost from hour to hour Agrenade company of the Northumberland Fusiliers consisting of twoofficers and 120 men was added to it by accident They had beenfighting at Hill 60 and had been eight days in the trenches On the wayback to join the 28th Division to which they belonged these grimyweary and hungry warriors fell in with Geddess force and promptlytook their places in his firing line That night they lived up to thefame of the old Fighting Fifth[Illustration Second Battle of YpresPosition on the morning of Friday April 23 1915]By the morning of Friday the Germans had crossed the canal south ofSteenstraate and were threatening that village which was held by theFrench Allenbys three divisions of cavalry along with two Indiandivisions were being hurried up with all speed to help the French whowere struggling on the west of the canal Meanwhile all along the linefrom Polygon Wood to the canal the big guns of the enemy were heavilyshelling our lines The fighting as we already know was heaviestagainst the Canadian 3rd Brigade which had suffered great losses bothfrom gas and from artillery fire There were gaps all along our frontand in one place the machine guns of the enemy were behind our trenchesWhile the Canadians between the little wood and Grafenstafel wereholding on British battalions were being hurried up as rapidly aspossible You will see from the map on page 208 that the 13th Brigadefilled the gap between the canal and the Pilkem road and that they weresupported by Territorials of the York and Durham Brigade who hadarrived in France only three days before Between Geddess detachmentand the little wood lay the 10th Brigade consisting of Territorialsthe 1st Warwicks 2nd Seaforths 1st Irish Fusiliers 2nd DublinFusiliers and 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders The Durhams andthe 1st Hants were holding the gap between the Canadians and the 28thDivision Such was the condition of the northern side of the salient onSaturday evening when the 3rd Canadian Brigade was retired TheNorthumbrian Division took its placeAbout 430 on Sunday morning the 10th Brigade and two battalions of theYork and Durham Brigade made a great attempt to recapture St JulienThe men reached the cottages at the end of the village but were broughtto a standstill by German machine guns They lost very heavily in theadvance but for the rest of the day they hung on to the blood and gasstained position Further east at Grafenstafel the Durhams wereassailed by shells filled with gases that choked and stupefied them andat two oclock in the afternoon before they could breathe freely againthe Germans charged down upon them From two oclock until seven theDurhams hurled back attack after attack but as the evening wore on thepressure proved too great and they were forced to retire with heavylosses to the little village of Fortuin A similar attempt was made onthe 28th Division but without success When night fell our front wasunbroken on the east as far north as Grafenstafel That Sunday nightyou will remember the Canadian 2nd Brigade was retired only to becalled up again the next day Its place was taken by the Lahore Divisionof IndiansMonday 26th April was a day of furious fighting and constant anxietyThe salient was greatly narrowed now and our men were shelled on threesides The Germans were making a curtain of fire behind our lines inorder that no reinforcements could be brought up Another fierce attackwas made on the Durhams who were compelled to fall back behind a littlestream to the south of Fortuin where they stood fast until the end ofthe day Shortly after ten in the morning the Northumbrians and theIndians made another desperate attempt to recapture St Julien It faredill The Northumbrians were held up by wire and were shot down indroves The Brigadier was killed 42 officers and some 1900 men fellNeither the Northumbrians nor the Indians could pierce the curtain offire The 40th Pathans known in India as the Forty Thieves losttheir colonel and nearly all their British officers The famous 57thWildes Rifles made a most heroic advance and though shells of allkinds fell thick and fast amongst them and their numbers were greatlyreduced the survivors managed to get within eighty yards of the Germantrenches where they dug themselves in When Captain Banks fell hisSikh orderly though weak from loss of blood picked up his body andstaggered with it to the rear until he fell exhausted[Illustration Second Battle of YpresThe position on the evening of Saturday April 24 1915]  CHAPTER XXVII  DAYS OF STRUGGLE AND ANXIETYIIThe Germans now opened the nozzles of the gas tubes in front of theirtrenches and sent a cloud of poisonous vapour against the Indians Thewretched victims suffered horribly and the survivors had to retirethrough the deadly gas amidst bursting shells and the incessant fire ofmachine guns and rifles It was during this retirement that Jemadar MirDast won the Victoria Cross as you will read laterThat night the northern side of the salient fell back Fighting stillwent on there were attacks and counterattacks without number and theGermans ceaselessly shelled our front By this time there were manyTerritorial regiments holding the northern face of the salient andright gallantly did they behave The salient was now an oblong of soawkward a shape that the front had to be shortened The old Ypressalient was such a silly thing it had always been a danger and now itwas more perilous than ever Accordingly preparations were made towithdraw the whole line until the salient became an easy curve with itsouter line three miles from YpresBefore however this could be done the Germans made another gasattack both against the French on the Ypres Canal and against ourtroops lying behind Fortuin The French were ready for it and their75s took a terrible toll of the enemy Our men were also ready for itthey were now provided with respiratorsnot yet of the best patternbut good enough to save them from the worst effects of the gas The 12thBrigade suffered most and was obliged to give way a little The 2ndSeaforths and the 10th Brigade did not move at all The Seaforthsdoctor Lieutenant Jones behaved with wonderful courage although badlygassed he stuck to his work for two whole days One Territorialbattalionthe 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlandersactually chargedthrough the gas and captured a German trenchMany other striking deeds of valour were done on that day A huge shellfell into a trench held by the 1st Rifle Brigade and buried CaptainRalston alive He was dug out only to be hit by the fragment of a shelland by this time there were only three men left in the trench Thoughshell after shell continued to drop into it the four men still foughton until their rifles were too hot to hold They snatched up the weaponsof the dead and took the full cartridge clips from the bodies of theslain and by so doing managed to keep up such a continuous fire thatthe Germans believed the trench to be held by a full company Ralstonand his men ran up and down the trench stumbling over sandbagstripping over heaps of blownin earth and falling over their deadcomrades They fired first from one point and then from another and inthis way bluffed the Germans and held the trench until nightfall whenreinforcements came up Three men and one officer had baffled swarms ofGermansLater on we shall read how Private Lynn of the 2nd LancashireFusiliers won the Victoria Cross by keeping his gun in action whileenveloped in the deadly gas I could fill many pages with stories of menwho did miracles of heroism during this awful timeOn 3rd May we shortened our line The 12th Brigade at the pivot heldfast During the night while picked riflemen from each company fired onthe enemy battalions were withdrawn piecemeal in perfect order andwith no losses You can form some idea of the skill with which thisretirement was conducted when I tell you that in some places ourtrenches were within ten yards of those of the enemy All the woundedexcept a few who were too far gone to be moved were safely carried tothe rear and in this merciful work the RAMC covered itself withglory Long lines of stretcherbearers bore the stricken men swiftlyand silently from cellars and dugouts along the dark roads until theywere out of danger from shell fire Some 780 of them were thus carriedinto safety and not one of them was lost[Illustration All that was left of themBy permission of The Illustrated London NewsWhen the wearied Canadians appeared on the outskirts of Ypres aftertheir heroic struggle their British comrades in the town turned out incrowds lined the streets and cheered and cheered again The pipers ofa Highland regiment put themselves at the head of the Canadian Scottishand amidst scenes of great enthusiasm played them through the streetsinto camp]Many of our men were reluctant to leave their trenches especially thoseon which they had spent much time and labour One man solemnly cleanedand swept his dugout before saying goodbye to it In one trench heldby a score of picked shots belonging to the 2nd Cheshires one man didnot receive the order to retire For a whole hour he remained andcontinued to fireone man against the whole army of Wurtemberg At lasthe discovered that he was alone and then and only then did he followhis comrades Not until the early morning of the 4th did the Germansknow that we had retired For hours before they had been busy shellingour empty trenchesThe map on page 213 shows you how the new line ran You will notice thatit was much easier to hold than the old salient which had beenhopelessly knocked out of shape The Germans now began to batter at thenew line and especially at the portion between the pivot and theYpresMenin road On the 8th they attacked furiously and though some ofour battalions fought almost to the last man the centre was all butdriven in The 1st Welsh however refused to budge They sent messageafter message back that they were holding a hot corner but that theywere very comfortable and could stick it as long as was necessary Nofewer than 900 shells were flung into the trenches of the 9th Argyll andSutherland Highlanders but the men did not yield a single inch On thatday they lost Colonel James Clark their wellbeloved leader who indays of peace was Chairman of the Edinburgh School BoardIt was now time to withdraw the 28th Division It had fought without apause from 22nd April to 12th May and had suffered almost as severelyas the famous 7th Division at the First Battle of Ypres Cavalrydivisions took over its trenches and the weary and muchbatteredsurvivors went into billets for greatlyneeded rest Still the fiercecontest continued The cavalry were terribly assailed and on 13th Maythe artillery fire was so deadly that the 7th Brigade lying to thenorth of the lake which you see on our eastern front had to fall backleaving an ugly rent in the line Troops were hurried up to fill thegap and at 230 the 8th Brigade assisted by armoured motor cars madea charge that will go down to history The dismounted cavalrymenadvanced as if on parade they swept forward utterly regardless ofdeath and won back the lost ground But no soldiers that ever woreuniform could have held on to the position in face of the awful fire ofthe German guns Our men did all that men could do but they had toretire and when the muster roll was read the regiments which had takenpart in this glorious but unavailing charge were found to be but shadowsof their former strength[Illustration Second Battle of YpresSketch showing the shortening of the line on May 3 1915]The infantry on our left were also fiercely attacked but they managedto hold their ground The Territorial battalions on this part of ourfront fought like veterans Sergeant Douglas Belcher with six menrepeated the exploit of Captain Ralston and nobly won the VictoriaCross for saving the flank of his division see page 218 The 2nd Essexcleared the Germans out of Shelltrap Farm at the point of the bayonetand held on to the ruins all day Like the Welsh they were quitecheerful under their ordeal and one of them swam to and fro across themoat carrying messages to headquarters[Illustration The Northumberland Fusiliers the Fighting Fifth beatingoff a German AttackFrom the picture by Philip Dadd By permission of The SphereIt was in the early hours of morning that the Germans began to attackus in force They battered our entanglements and our trench breastworkfor some time and part of the entanglements was actually blown acrossthe trenches Fortunately we were able to meet them with steady andcontinuous rifle fire and stopped the rush     In some cases theGermans were so bunched together that our men simply fired into thebrown it being impossible to miss them at such close range]The great battle was now ebbing away into a series of lesserengagements As we shall learn later the Allies had begun to make abig thrust near Festubert and towards Lens The Germans had been obligedto send some of their heavy guns to the south and the artillery fire onthe Ypres salient consequently slackened But before the battle endedthe Germans made one more attemptand this the most terrible of alltoshatter our lines Again they used the foul weapon by which they had wonground at the outset of the struggleOn the early morning of Monday 24th May when the sky was cloudless anda light northeasterly breeze was blowing they released gas against ourfront from Shelltrap Farm to the lake The wind carried the poisonousvapour towards the southwest and it rolled over nearly five miles ofour trenches in a cloud which in some places was forty feet high Forfour and a half hours the gas surged towards us Where our men werequick to don their respirators they were able to hold their ground butwhere there was delay they suffered horribly After the gas came aviolent bombardment from three points of the compass and in variousplaces our line was pushed in until three dangerous salients appearedBritish steadfastness however prevailed Except in two places ourlines remained intact The 9th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders the2nd Royal Irish and the 9th Lancers lost very heavily Amongst thosewho fell was Captain Francis Grenfell who had already won the VictoriaCross for a splendid deed of pluck and coolness which I described onpage 88 of our second volume                           The Second Battle of Ypres was over It was not so full of danger to usas the first battle but it will be ever memorable because for thefirst time in the warfare of civilized men a foul and deadly weapon hadbeen used You must have noticed in reading these pages how theGermans relied on machinery to overcome us Highexplosive shells andpoison gasthese were the weapons which they believed would give themvictory During the Second Battle of Ypres the German infantry made fewserious attacks and when they did so they were almost destroyed to aman Cannot you imagine the anguish of our brave fellows assailed by gasand shell fire and unable to reach their foes Many of them goaded tomadness stood up on their parapets and challenged the enemy to come onSome of the Germans accepted the challenge our men cheered and thenswept them to earth It was the Second Battle of Ypres which taught ushow inferior we were to the Germans in machinery and our bitterexperience had much to do with the formation of the National Governmentand the setting up of a Ministry of MunitionsWe lost ground in front of Ypres and we lost tens of thousands ofgallant men but we had something to be proud of when the end came Weknew that our soldiers man for man were superior to the Germans andwe were specially proud of our Territorialsnot only of the Canadiansbut of the miners of South Wales and North England the hinds andtradesmen of the Scottish Lowlands the shepherds and gamekeepers of theHighlands the clerks and tradesmen of our great cities A few shortmonths ago they had been working in the mine the field the factorythe shop and the office never dreaming that they would be called on toply rifle and bayonet in a lifeanddeath struggle for all that theyheld dear But in front of Ypres they bore themselves as though war hadever been their business and they fought and died with a heroism thatmust never be forgotten They went down into the Valley of the Shadow ofDeath and some of them came out of it silent weary sick at heart butno man of them felt his faith falter and all were determined thatnever while God gave them the strength to pull a trigger should thefoul foe prevail                           The beautiful little city of Ypres famous as far back as the days ofChaucer and adorned with oldtime buildings that were the gift of theages to the modern world was now a heap of ruins German guns hadshattered it beyond repair It resembled a city destroyed by anearthquakea rubbish heap with here and there a few gaping walls andshotrent towers brooding over the desolation like gaunt skeletonsNever while our Empire enduresand God grant that it may be forayecan Ypres and the bloodsodden meadows that lie eastward of thecity be anything but holy ground to the British people For ever thecity and its neighbourhood will be sacred to the memory of our gloriousBritish dead  CHAPTER XXVIII  HEROES OF THE YPRES SALIENTSeven Victoria Crosses were awarded for remarkable feats of courage anddevotion during the great series of struggles known as the Second Battleof Ypres You will not I am sure make the mistake of supposing thatthis little list comprises the names of all who wrought deeds ofglorious valour during those days and nights of combat Hundreds of menwho received no mention proved themselves worthy of the honour and manyof those who were awarded less notable decorations fell no whit short ofthose who carried off the palm According to custom I shall now giveyou some account of those on whom the highest of all military honourswas conferredLanceCorporal Frederick Fisher 13th Canadian BattalionYou already know that the Second Battle of Ypres was largely Canadasbattle It is therefore fitting that the first three heroes in our rollof glory should be Canadians On 23rd April 1915 in the neighbourhoodof St Julien LanceCorporal Frederick Fisher who was in charge of amachine gun went forward under heavy fire and most gallantly assistedin covering the retreat of a battery Four of his crew were killed butas soon as he had made up the number he went

raging the French were making abig effort in Artois more especially in the district between Lens andArras On page 223 you will see a map showing the main features of thisdistrict Fix your attention for a moment on the high ground markedND de Lorettethat is Notre Dame de Lorette You notice by theside of the name a cross this shows the position of the church of OurLady of Lorette It stands on a bare ridge broken by many gullies andwith a few coppices here and there To the south of the ridge there is abroad hollow from which rises Mont St Eloi Do not confound this hillwith the St Eloi which lies to the south of YpresIn the early days of May the Germans were holding a sharp salient inthis district Their lines extended from the east of the village ofLoos[38] across the broad highway which you see running south to Arrasthen across the Lorette ridge and to the west of the two villages whichlie to the south of it From Carency the German lines curved sharplyback still covering the highroad Upon this salient the French made agreat onslaught which began on 13th May and did not end until theclose of the month[Illustration The French Offensive between Arras and Lens]The salient consists mainly of a chalky plateau full of hollows eachwith its village or little town The fields are hedgeless and are cutacross by many white roads The ravines of the plateau and the manyvillages had been made almost impregnable by the Germans who had set upall along their line numberless little forts armed with machine gunsand connected by a maze of trenches There were at least five lines ofvery strong trenches one behind the other in that part of theirposition which lay between Loos and the village of Ablain It was adesperate task which the French now set themselves but should it provesuccessful it would be well worth the sacrifice entailed Further anassault on the German lines in the west was now necessary The Russiansat this time were being driven back by a storm of artillery to whichthey could make no resistance and General Joffre saw that somethingmust be done to draw off German forces from the Eastern front if theRussians were not to be overwhelmed and put out of action altogetherHis plan was as follows the French were to try to capture Lens and theBritish further north were to make a desperate push towards Lille Ifthese movements succeeded the line of railway all along the Germanfront from Lille to Soissons would be captured and the enemy would beforced to retreat into BelgiumI shall tell you the story of the British assault in a later chapter Iwill now confine myself to the French effort On Sunday 9th MayGeneral Foch who had brought up no less than 1100 guns of all kindsbegan to bombard the German trenches between the villages of Carency andLa Targette You will notice from the map on page 223 that thesetrenches were called The White Works They were so named because theparapets being cut from the chalk showed up white and clear TheFrench bombardment was the most terrible that had ever been known inEurope up to that time It went on for hours and the French 75s whichcan fire twentyfive aimed shots a minute seemed to be pouring outshells like gigantic machine guns When the bombardment ceased the WhiteWorks were simply a ploughed field strewn with fragments of wire andhuman bodies More than 300000 shells were hurled upon them in thecourse of the day[Footnote 38 Loce about a mile to the northwest of Lens]  CHAPTER XXX  THE BATTLE OF THE ARTOISIIAt ten in the morning of Sunday 9th May the infantry advanced theright seized the ruins of La Targette and pushed on to capture NeuvilleSt Vaast which lies in a hollow to the east of it The big church thecemetery and almost every house in the place bristled with machineguns and furious fights took place inside the buildings from cellar togarret Nevertheless by noon the village was in French hands Farthernorth the centre had swept over the torn and tumbled ground which hadonce been the White Works had crossed the highroad and had dug itselfin two and a half miles to the east of the position from which it hadstarted that morning Never since the trench war began had so muchground been gained in a single day The French troops in the centre werein the highest spirits as they surged on they plucked sprigs of lilacand hawthorn and stuck them in their caps Had the whole line been ableto advance along with the centre Lens would have been captured thatday The left however was held up in front of Carency which was nowbeing bombarded When night fell three lines of German trenches had beenwon 3000 prisoners had been taken and 10 field guns and 50 machineguns had been captured[Illustration A French Bayonet Charge in the LabyrinthBy permission of The Illustrated London NewsIn the left background is seen the cemetery of Neuville St Vaastthrough the walls of which French troops are seen advancing towards theLabyrinth Our illustration shows the fighting reported by the French onJune 6 At Neuville St Vaast said the report we captured severalhouses and drew closer to a redoubt on the northwest and occupied thecommunication trench which leads to it We captured new trenches in thecentre and in the south of the Labyrinth and advanced a hundred yardsIn this great work the struggle has continued without ceasing for eightdays and we now hold twothirds of it]Next day the French were hard at it again They pushed on to theoutskirts of Loos attacked the church on the Lorette ridge tooktrenches to the south of it seized the cemetery at Neuville and beatoff the German reserves which had been hurried up in motor carsEverywhere the fighting was most desperate for the Germans had turnedevery possible place into a little fort and each of them had to becarried by storm By Wednesday 12th May the Germans in Carency weresurrounded More than 20000 shells had been hurled into the villageand 2000 Germans were obliged to hold up their hands Meanwhile thesummit of the Lorette ridge had been carried and only two or threestrongholds on this high ground held out The Germans at once rainedshells on the ridge and the ghastly scenes of Hill 60 were repeatedThe French however clung to their trenches nothing could move them[Illustration]On the 13th amidst drenching rain and in teeth of a bitter north windthey returned to the assault They had broken the German line but theirwork was by no means done for though the trenches had been carried theGerman forts all along the front still held out and each of them had tobe besieged The strongest position of all lay to the south of Neuvilleand was known as the Labyrinth[39] It was a wonderful network oftrenches and redoubts tunnels and roofedin pits it covered two squaremiles and was so situated that the longrange fire of the Frenchartillery could not get at it Probably never before had such astronghold been constructed It was a cunning maze furnished with everydeathdealing device known to the science of war It contained enginesfor making poison gas machines for throwing liquid fire scores ofsmall fortresses and underground passages which enabled the defendersto get to the rear of the attackers In the background an enormouscollection of big guns was in position ready to sweep away any troopsadvancing upon it Such was the Labyrinth which the French wereattacking They could not proceed until it was captured for as youwill observe from the map on page 223 it enfiladed their advanceBy the end of May good progress had been made in clearing the LabyrinthThe German salient had gone the French line had been straightened outand Lens was closely besetAn officer gives us a vivid picture of the struggle in the Labyrinthwhich was not captured till towards the end of September    The war of trenches is nothing compared with the struggle of    the burrows Picture to yourselves narrow galleries feebly    lighted by flickering oil lamps in which the foes are separated    only by sandbags which they keep pushing against each other    As soon as an opening shows a terrific handtohand fight    begins in which grenades and the bayonet are the only arms    possible Sometimes the Germans take to knives and revolvers    and one day they even began throwing burning liquids but in    spite of these cowardly tricks our men always had the best of    it They fought with clubbed rifles and fists when required and    their courage was never shaken as the Germans soon saw       The passages in which we were advancing were 18 feet deep and    often 24 feet and more The water was sweating through in all    directions and the sickly smell was unbearable Imagine too    that for three weeks we were not able to get rid of the dead    bodies amongst which we had to live night and day One burrow    120 feet long took us thirteen days of ceaseless fighting to    conquer entirely The Germans had placed barricades trap doors    and traps of all kinds in it When we stumbled we ran the risk    of being pierced by bayonets hidden in holes lightly covered    with earth And all this went on in almost complete darkness We    had to use pocket electric lamps and advance with the utmost    cautionThe first stage of the Battle of Artois may be said to have ended withthe capture of Neuville St Vaast on 8th June The French had donesplendidly though they had not yet won a decisive success The Germanlosses during the terrible month of May cannot have been less than60000 and the French had suffered almost as severely They hadadvanced with but few casualties it was in the handtohand fighting inthe villages and against the forts that so many of their men fell Thevictory was due largely to the French artillery but the infantry didmore than its fair share It had shown itself as full of fiery courageand dashing bravery as in the great days of Napoleon[Footnote 39 According to the old classical story there was in Crete abuilding constructed for King Minos in which dwelt the terrible beastknown as the Minotaur This building which was known as the Labyrinthcontained many winding passages arranged in such a fashion that a wayout was most difficult to find]  CHAPTER XXXI  THE BATTLE OF FESTUBERTSuppose for a moment that in the first week of May a British soldierin the captured village of Neuve Chapelle is looking towards the Germanlines Away to the northeast he sees a long ridge crowned by thevillage of Aubers He gazes upon this ridge with eyes of desire andrecalls the many determined but so far fruitless efforts which theBritish army has made to capture it He remembers that as far back asOctober 17 1914 the redroofed village in the distance was in Britishhands and that two days later the 2nd Royal Irish by storming thehamlet of Le Pilly[40] attained our farthest east But our grasp ofthe ridge was very feeble it could not be held and by midNovember wehad fallen back behind the ruins amidst which our soldier now standsThe coveted position was as far off as everFresh in his memory is that terrible day in the second week of March1915 when he raced through the streets of Neuve Chapelle full of hopethat the goal would be reached before nightfall Alas he and hisfellows were again doomed to disappointment The Aubers ridge so nearand yet so far was still beyond our grasp And now the rumour reacheshis ears that another big effort is to be made The French are strivingsouth of the canal to carry Lens[41] and we are to attack for thedouble purpose of preventing the enemy from sending reinforcements tothe south and of reaching the ridge if possible Once we are securelyestablished on it the flat plain to the eastward will be commanded byour guns and La Basse and Lille will soon know the German no more                           Look at this map and find the wood of Biez which you will rememberfigured largely in the fighting around Neuve Chapelle To the east ofthe wood you will see a road which skirts the ridge for a mile and ahalf and then climbs it to pass through the villages of Aubers andFromelles We were now about to make a thrust through the wood andthrough Fromelles in the hope of reaching the ridge On the morning ofSunday 9th May the 8th Division advanced against the village and atthe same time the 1st Corps and the Indians began to push through thewood The attacks were preceded by the usual bombardment Ourhighexplosive shells wrecked the first line trenches of the enemy butunhappily did not do sufficient damage to the second line and our menfound themselves up against unbroken wire and unbreached parapets Someground was gained but it could not be held and by the evening we hadmade but little progress Many fine deeds of heroism were done duringthe fierce fighting of the day[Illustration]On the left the 24th and 25th Brigades behaved most gallantly and aTerritorial battalion the 13th Kensington of the London Regimentperformed a feat which won high and welldeserved praise from Sir JohnFrench The Kensington men carried three lines of German trenches withthe bayonet and held on to them until the German artillery fire becameso intense that flesh and blood could no longer endure it When theyfell back they had but four company officers leftSir Douglas Haig now recognized that the attack against the Biez Woodand Fromelles had failed Nothing daunted he now proposed to makeanother attempt to win the Aubers ridge this time from positionsbetween Neuve Chapelle and Givenchy On the map p 231 you will seeFestubert which is less than a mile to the north of Givenchy FromFestubert and from the points to the north of it marked A and B threeattacks were to be made The Indians and part of the 2nd Division wereto push forward from A the 20th Brigade of the 7th Division was toadvance from B the 22nd Brigade of the same division from FestubertIn front of our positions across the wet fields the Germans lay inthree lines of trenches all of which would have to be carried beforethe Aubers ridge could be reachedAll day Saturday 15th May British troops were pouring into thetrenches and the Germans guessed what was afoot During the afternoonthey frequently shouted Come on we are ready In the late afternoonSir John French rode along the line greeting his men with inspiringwords and wishing them good luck in the coming struggle A heavybombardment of the German front had been going on for some days Now itgrew heavier and shortly before midnight on Saturday evening 15th Maythe order to assault was given[Illustration]As our men at A left their trenches the sky was lit up by the whiteglare of German flares and searchlights The Indians soon foundthemselves checked by the fire of many machine guns installed in a groupof farms which the Germans had turned into little fortresses The 2ndDivision however carried the first line trenches opposite to them andbroke into the second line By daybreak five or six hundred yards of thefirst two lines of the enemys trenches were in our hands All daySunday the big guns of the enemy fiercely bombarded these trenches andcreated a zone of fire behind them Nevertheless many heroes carryingsupplies of ammunition and bombs crossed the three hundred yards whichseparated them from their comrades Shells burst around them the wholespace was swept by machinegun fire and a man had to risk his life ahundred times before he could get throughAmmunition parties of the A Company of the 1st Kings Liverpoolunder Lieutenants Hutchison and Roberts succeeded in this perilouswork though their casualties were very heavy LanceCorporal Tombs ofthe same regiment displayed wonderful heroism in rescuing the woundedlying out in the open and was afterwards awarded the Victoria Cross Onthe 17th Lieutenant Hutchison led a party of bombers along a trenchpartly held by us and partly by the Germans So skilfully was this workaccomplished that 200 Germans were forced to surrender and 200 otherswere driven pellmell down their communication trench For this fineexploit Lieutenant Hutchison was awarded the Military CrossThe attack in the centre made good headway Though checked by a flankingfire the 20th Brigade pushed on and when reinforced reached theoutskirts of the hamlet marked C where it broke into the second linetrenches Late on Sunday evening the 1st Grenadiers were brought up andtheir bombing attacks were successful in driving many Germans from theirlairs One company of the 2nd Scots Guards on this part of the lineadvanced too far ahead and was cut off Like the Canadians at StJulien the trapped Guards fought to the last man When we took theground a few days later the gallant fellows were found lying stiff andcold with the enemys dead thick around themThe movement from Festubert was still more successful The trenchesagainst which the attack was launched formed a perfect maze yet anadvance of more than a mile was made The 1st Welsh Fusiliers swarmedover the German parapets with real Celtic ardour and drove the enemydown a long communication trench into an orchard Company SergeantMajorBarter of this regiment called for volunteers and he and his eightdevoted companions did miracles of heroism in the German second lineThey cleared five hundred yards of trench discovered and cut the leadsof eleven mines and captured three officers and 102 men SergeantMajorBarter afterwards received the Victoria CrossNext day rain fell heavily but the struggle in the trenches stillcontinued On this day a terrible scene was witnessed at a point betweenA and C The remnant of a battalion of Saxons proposed to surrender Asthey advanced towards our line they waved a white flag tied to a stickAt once their comrades opened rifle fire on them and the guns behinddropped shells among them In a few moments the Saxons were destroyedalmost to a manIn the evening the 21st Brigade on the right made another advance inthe course of which a Territorial battalion the 4th CameronHighlanders recruited mainly from Invernessshire Skye and the mistyHebrides pushed on far before their comrades Under heavy fire theyadvanced over country liberally seamed with ditches one of which was sodeep and wide that most of the men had to swim across it The thirdcompany reached the back end of a German communication trench but beingwithout bombs and having almost wholly used up its cartridges was soonin desperate straits About midnight these gallant fellows werereinforced by two platoons but as they had no machine guns and as theGermans were fast closing in on both sides of them and they were inthe air they were ordered to retire In the small hours of the morningthey made their way back through a heavy rain of shells and by the timethat the weary mudstained battalion had regained the British positionit had been reduced to half its strength[Illustration Playing their Comrades up to the Germans the Pipers ofthe Black Watch at RichebourgBy permission of The Illustrated London NewsDuring the general advance in May the Black Watch suffered very heavilyThey assaulted the German trenches a few miles east of Richebourg pointA on the map page 231 Their first charge in the morning only reachedthe German wire and they fell in swathes under the mercilessmachinegun fire of the enemy During the afternoon other companies ofthe Black Watch dashed up and by a brilliant charge captured thetrenches which had defied them in the morning It was during this chargethat the pipers showed wonderful courage The two pipers of each companyplayed their comrades right up to the Germans The skirl of their pipeswas heard above the din and crash of Maxims rifles and burstingshrapnel The lads of brown heath and shaggy wood rushed on to victorywith the pibroch of their sires ringing in their ears]Still the fight went on The Canadians who had recovered from theirterrible ordeal on the Ypres salient were now sent up to relieve thetwo brigades of the 7th Division On the afternoon of 18th May twocompanies of the 16th Canadian Scottish were ordered to advance on thehamlet at C to the northwest of the orchard already mentioned Onecompany made a frontal attack and the other proceeded along thecommunication trench which had been won by the Welsh Fusiliers Theadvance was partly successful and the companies dug in five hundredyards in front of the starting pointOn the night of the 20th an attack was made on the orchard itselfDuring the afternoon the little enclosure was heavily bombarded and at745 when the artillery fire ceased the Canadians climbed over theirparapets and dashed forward The advance was made in broad daylight anda torrent of fire beat down upon them At the edge of the orchard theydiscovered a deep ditch full of water with a wired hedge on the otherside Without pause the men plunged into the water and scrambling upthe bank pushed through gaps in the hedges and swarmed into theorchard On the far side there were many Germans but they fled as theCanadians charged Before long the orchard was in British handsEarly on the 20th the 10th Canadian battalion made a gallant butunavailing attempt to seize a very strong German position known asBexhill The approach to it was defended by a redoubt strongly held withmachine guns On the evening of the next day the Canadians returned tothe attack but it was not until the early morning of the 24th that theredoubt was captured Five hundred men of the 5th Brigade along with100 men of the 7th British Columbia Battalion made an advance in thebright moonlight across a ditch which had been previously bridged andby four in the morning were in possession of the stronghold Two hourslater Bexhill itself was won and the victors received orders to dig inand hang on They did so in spite of three very fiercecounterattacksIt was now clear that we could make no further headway without more gunsand more shells than we then possessed We were meeting with the samedifficulty that had beset the French in Artois The German lines brokeup into a series of little fortresses each of which could only becaptured by a separate assault It was the Battle of Festubert whichbrought home to the British people the absolute necessity for providingthe army with more and more big guns and an almost unending stream ofmunitions Our losses were very heavy and they would have been greatlyreduced had our artillery been more numerous and better supplied Lessthan three weeks after the close of the battle the Government appointeda Minister of MunitionsThe battle came to an end on the 26th about the same time that thefierce struggle on the Ypres salient died down The results were summedup by Sir John French as follows Since 16th May the First Army haspierced the enemys lines on a total front of four miles The entirefirst line system of trenches has been captured on a front of 3200yards and on the remaining portion the first and second lines oftrenches are in our possession During the fighting we captured 8officers 777 men 10 machine guns and a considerable amount of warmaterial[Footnote 40 See Vol III p 61][Footnote 41 See Chap XXX]  CHAPTER XXXII  THE HEROISMS OF FESTUBERTIn the great struggle for the trenches which I described in the formerchapter there was plentiful opportunity for our men to do deeds ofindividual daring The fighting was at close quarters and often menwere engaged in handtohand struggles I could fill a volume of thiswork with the heroisms of Festubert alone Let me tell you a few of themany gallant deeds done in the ten days of the battleI have already mentioned the exploit of Company SergeantMajor Barterand his eight comrades One of the men who joined his party was known asPrivate Hardy While the bombing of the German second line trenches wasgoing on Hardy did splendid work but was hit in the right arm andfell fainting to the ground His wound was dressed and he recovered Assoon as he was on his feet again he cried Luckily I am lefthandedand ran off to rejoin Barter With his left hand he flung grenade aftergrenade but the white bandage on his arm made him a good mark for theGerman sharpshooters and he fell with a bullet through his head Nowcomes the astonishing part of the story Soon after the war broke outCaptain H S Smart of the 53rd Sikhs was granted short leave andreturned to England He overstayed his leave and disappeared Allinquiries failed to trace him and his name was removed from the ArmyList After the death of Private Hardy it was discovered that thedauntless man was none other than the missing Captain Smart He had solonged to fight in France that he had deserted the Indian army and hadjoined the 2nd Battalion of the Queens Royal West Surrey Regiment as aprivate When the story became known the King ordered the heros name tobe restored to the Army List with full honours                           During the fighting in the Festubert district one of our officers wasseen lying out on our front wounded He was on the lip of a mine craterwhere he was hidden from the Germans Our people could see him and whenhe gave signs of life they determined to bring him in Under cover ofthe fire of our snipers a noncommissioned officer crawled out with arope which he made fast to the wounded officer who then crawled or wasgradually dragged into our trench his rescuer staying behind in hisplace This noble fellow was continually bombed but at last he toowas able to crawl back to safety                           Sir Max Aitken tells us that the Canadian artillery shortly after theaffair at the orchard played a very effective trick on the GermansThey opened fire on the enemys trenches and meanwhile the infantrymade a great show of fixing bayonets rigging up trench ladders andblowing whistles just as though they meant to attack as soon as thebombardment was over The Germans according to their custom promptlyretired to their support trenches and prepared to shoot down theCanadians as they advanced As soon as the Germans were in the supporttrenches the gunners lifted their sights and began shelling themwhereupon the Germans rushed back to the front trenches Still there wasno infantry attack When the front trenches were full once more theCanadian gunners shortened their range and the full blast of their firefell upon the crowded Germans causing great havoc Next day the worldwas told that the Germans had beaten off a desperate attack The Huns inthe trenches however knew better for that evening one of them criedout Say Sam Slick no dirty tricks tonight                           On the 26th Corporal Pym of the Royal Canadian Dragoons showed greatselfsacrifice and contempt of danger in rescuing wounded men TheBritish and German lines were only sixty yards apart An English voicein the narrow Nomans Land was heard calling for help and Pymdetermined to try to bring in the sufferer He crept out into a zoneswept by constant rifle and machinegun fire and found the man who hadbeen wounded in both thigh bones and had been lying out in the open forthree days and nights The poor fellow was in such torment that he couldnot bear to be dragged in Pym therefore called back to the trenchand Sergeant Hollowell crept out

decided that the ground was toorough for him to drag a stretcher across it Once more therefore herecrossed the firezone and at last with the utmost difficultybrought the wounded man in alive                           The heroism of Sergeant Hickey of the 4th Canadian Battalion must not gounrecorded On 24th May he volunteered to go out and recover two trenchmortars which belonged to his battalion and had been abandoned in aditch the previous day In doing so he was going to almost certaindeath Over and over again he escaped by the narrowest shave yetnevertheless he found the mortars and brought them in He alsodiscovered the shortest and safest route by which men could be broughtup from the reserve trenches to the firing line It was a discoverysays Sir Max Aitken which saved lives at a moment when every life wasof the greatest value and time and time again he guided party afterparty up the trenches by this route Unhappily this cheery modestsoldier was shot down by a stray bullet on 30th May And so there wenthome to the God of battles a man to whom battle had been a joy                           The following Victoria Crosses were awarded for outstanding deeds ofbravery during the

began a heavy bombing attack to whichthe Sikhs made a vigorous reply until noon when their bombs gave outIt was then decided to send up a bombing party from the reservetrenches and Lieutenant Smyth was ordered to lead forward ten men ladenwith two boxes of 96 bombs Dropping over the parapet they wriggledtheir way through thick mud pulling and pushing the boxes between themThey had to cross rough ground while bullets whizzed around them and theair was white with puffs of shrapnel All the time they were in fullview of the enemy The little party had now been reduced totwoLieutenant Smyth and

five riversNorthWest India]  CHAPTER XXXIII  THE GALLIPOLI PENINSULAOn 25th Aprilsix weeks and four days after our naval failure at theNarrowsBritish forces landed on the Gallipoli peninsula Before Irelate the marvellous story of how our men gained a footing on itsrugged shores I must give you some idea of the nature of the countryOn pages 248 249 you will see a birdseye view of part of thepeninsula One glance at it shows clearly that Gallipoli is a naturalfortress and that it is the most unlikely bit of selfcontained countryin which any general would wish to conduct a campaign In itsbewildering mass of hills and ravines it resembles a portion of theNorthWest Frontier of IndiaThe peninsula is connected with the mainland by the isthmus of Bulairwhich is but three miles across from beach to beach From Bulair thepeninsula runs in a southwesterly direction for fiftytwo miles andnear its centre broadens out to its greatest width of twelve miles Theshores of the northern half of the peninsula slope steeply to the Gulfof Xeros from a chain of hills which extend as far south as Cape SuvlaOn this part of the coast the cliffs rise up almost from the watersedge and there are no landingplaces except a few gullies which are toonarrow for military movementsSir Ian Hamilton[43] the accomplished general who commanded our forcesin Gallipoli tells us that the southern half of the peninsula resemblesa badlyworn boot with the ankle between Gaba Tepe and Maidos beneaththe heel lies the cluster of forts at the Narrows while at the toe wefind the strongholds which were reduced by the gun fire of our ships on25th FebruaryAt first sight the interior of the peninsula from Suvla Bay southwardslooks like a choppy sea which has been suddenly frozen If however welook closely at the map on page 168 we shall be able to make out threeprominent features Running right across the toe of the peninsula fromsea to sea at a distance of three and a half miles from Cape Helles isa ridge which rises in its highest part to the Achi Baba peak 591 feetabove sea level Big guns on this ridge command all the toe of thepeninsula which is hollowed out something like the bowl of a spoon sothat only the outer edges can be shelled directly from the sea Theinside of the bowl is not level but is filled up with numerous spursand gulliesNow look at the forts of the Narrows Behind them is a plateautheKilid Bahr plateauwhich rises in the peak of Pasha Dagh to a height of700 feet above the level of the sea and extends westwards for aboutfive miles The Achi Baba ridge you observe is the buttress andoutlying defence of this plateau on the south To the northwest of theplateau you see a network of high hills with very steep sides and deepravines This is the Sari Bair mountain which forms the buttress andoutlying defence of the Kilid Bahr plateau on the north Some of itspeaks are nearly 800 feet highI have already told you that the forts at the Narrows are the realdefence of the Dardanelles We had already failed to capture them by anaval attack If however we could reach the Kilid Bahr plateau byland we could attack the forts from the rearthe side on which theyare least capable of resistance But as you notice nature has madethis plateau very difficult of access An invader from the south mustfirst carry the Achi Baba ridge before he can reach it and if he landssouth of Suvla Point he must fight his way across the Sari BairYou have already gathered that the peninsula is difficult to traverseeven in times of peace the few dwellers on it make most of theirjourneys from point to point by water Except in a few valleys thereare no cultivated fields and save for a few cypress and olive grovesthe whole peninsula consists of bare or scrubcovered hills and ravinesfilled with jungle Amidst the rocks flourish many strange and beautifulflowers Water is scarce and the villages and hamlets are few and farbetweenLook again at the map on page 168 and follow the track which runs fromCape Helles northward through the village of Krithia and over the AchiBaba ridge A branch of this track leads as you see across the KilidBahr plateau On the western coast just north of Gaba Tepe you willobserve a track which meets the track from Krithia General Ian Hamiltonproposed to land a force on the tip of the peninsula and another forcenear Gaba Tepe These forces were to fight their way forward until theleft wing of the southern army came into touch with the right wing ofthe northern army Then the united armies would advance on to the KilidBahr plateau from which our big guns would be able to destroy theEuropean forts at the Narrows When these were reduced we should be in aposition to attack the forts on the Asiatic side at short range and ifall went well our ships would be able to dash through and in thecourse of a day or two train their guns on ConstantinopleThe first business was to put our troops ashore The line of high yellowcliffs fringing the sea was carefully surveyed and note was taken ofevery place where a landing was possible A glance at the birdseyeview shows you clearly that good beaches are rare On the map page 168you will see various spots marked by capital letters round the tip ofthe peninsula Just south of Cape Tekke where you see the letter Wthere is a small sandy bay and half a mile north of it a break in thecliffs marked X Three and a half miles further up the coast Y thereis a scrubcovered gully and eastwards of W there is another sandybeach V about three hundred yards across Round the corner stillfurther eastwards is Morto Bay with a small beach S commanded by theguns of Kum Kale On these beaches General Hamilton decided to land hissouthern army The northern army was to be put ashore to the north ofGaba Tepe where the sandstone cliffs recede a little from the watersedgeNot a single one of the beaches affords a really good landingplaceAlmost everywhere the cliffs rise steeply from a narrow strip of shoreAs you know the Turks had ample notice of our invasion and they haddiligently and skilfully prepared for it There were mines barbedwireentanglements and trenches on the beaches and along the cliff topsthey had constructed very formidable works in some places ten feetdeep There were snipers in every bush machine guns were cunninglyhidden in the rocks and behind the trenches on the cliffs there werefield guns backed by heavy pieces on the Achi Baba ridge To land onthese beaches and carry the cliffs would be worse than storming theEmbankment out of Thames barges with the enemy comfortably establishedwith his guns on the second floor of the Savoy Hotel The Turksbelieved the operation to be quite impossible and indeed according toall the rules not a single invader should have left the beaches aliveFor this most difficult and dangerous enterprise General Hamilton wassupplied with a weak and somewhat motley army of 120000 mena forcefar inferior in numbers to that which the Turks could bring against usOne division of this army the 29th was composed of two brigades ofregulars and a third brigade consisting of three regular battalions anda Territorial battalionthe 5th Royal Scots the remainder consisted oftwo naval brigades and a brigade of marines the Australian and NewZealand Division a large number of Indian troops and the EastLancashire Territorial Division together with French marines FrenchColonial troops and the Foreign Legion To oppose these three armycorps the Turks are said to have had 275000 troops within reachSir Ian Hamiltons army was assembled in Egypt By the 17th of March thetransports were at Tenedos Unfortunately they were found to be wronglyloaded and the bulk of them had to be sent back to Alexandria wherethe various units were properly redistributed amongst the ships Aboutthe middle of April the expedition began to arrive in the Bay ofMudros[44] Part of the force was landed on the island and the restremained on board ship where night and day under the direction ofnaval officers dress rehearsals of the landing took place By the 20thof April all was ready and five days later the great adventure began[Footnote 43 Born 1853 He had for forty years served with distinctionin every British war and had been present with the Japanese inManchuria He was an excellent writer and something of a poet Since1910 he had been Inspector of Oversea Forces][Footnote 44 In the Turkish island of Lemnos one of the largestislands in the gean Sea It is about sixty miles as the aeroplane fliesfrom Gaba Tepe]  CHAPTER XXXIV  THE BATTLE OF THE LANDINGYou are now to imagine yourself wrapped in the invisible cloak of thefairies and able to move over land and sea where you will with thespeed of thought Thus magically endowed you will be able to flit toand fro and witness one of the most remarkable invasions known tohistoryDusk is falling on the evening of 23rd April and you are hovering overthe Lemnian harbour of Mudros The haven is as crowded as the port ofLiverpool In the dim light you see a huge fleet of grim gray warshipsof all classes from the mighty Queen Elizabeth down to the littlepuffing launches that speed from ship to ship You also notice manygreat transports grimy colliers minesweepers and trawlers As youwatch a large number of the warships transports and minesweeperscast off and move out of the harbour Their lights disappear in thedistance They are off to Tenedos where they will embark the troopsthat are to land on the beaches round the tip of the peninsulaThe morning of the 24th sees the harbour still busy and animated thoughmost of the ships have departed An almost unending stream of boatseach of them packed with tall bronzed Australians and New Zealandersplies towards the warships and transports that remain By noon 10000men are on board all are in the highest spirits keen and eager for thecoming battle Every man knows what lies before him All have read orheard the CommanderinChiefs message addressed to Soldiers of Franceand of the King    Before us lies an adventure unprecedented in modern war    Together with our comrades of the Fleet we are about to force a    landing upon an open beach in face of positions which have been    vaunted by our enemies as impregnable    The landing will be made good by the help of God and the Navy    the positions will be stormed and the war brought one step    nearer to a glorious close    Remember said Lord Kitchener when bidding adieu to your    Commanderremember once you set foot upon the Gallipoli    Peninsula you must fight the thing through to a finish    The whole world will be watching our progress Let us prove    ourselves worthy of the great feat of arms entrusted to us      Ian Hamilton General                           We will now follow the fortunes of the gallant Australians and NewZealanders The transports escorted by the Second Squadron of theFleet steam slowly on and by halfpast one on the morning of the 25thhave reached a prearranged point The sea is calm there is scarcely abreath of wind the moon is shining behind the ships and the silence ofnight is only broken by the throb of the propellers The ships heave toSwiftly and with scarce a sound shadowy figures climb down into boatsThey are the 1500 men who are to be the first to set foot on thepeninsula Meanwhile their comrades are being transferred from thetransports to six destroyers It is now 230 and the warships togetherwith the destroyers and the towed boats move slowly and silentlytowards a point about a mile north of Gaba Tepe At 330 the order isgiven to go ahead and land Away go the boats and forty minuteslater the destroyers follow them[Illustration How the Five BeachesY X W V and Swere stormed andthe British and French landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula Sunday April25 1915By permission of The SphereThe following units landed on the various beachesBeach Y 1stKings Own Scottish Borderers and The Plymouth Marine

begins to break and the men in the boats see beforethem the loom of the steep cliffs underneath which they are soon totread Beneath those cliffs there is a very narrow strip of sand abouta thousand yards long closed in on the north and south by smallpromontories Near the northern end of the beach a small but steep gullyruns up into the hills at right angles to the shore At the southern endthere is a deep ravine with very steep scrubclad sides Between theravine and the gully a lofty spur comes down to the shore Such is thelandingplace The CommanderinChief has chosen it because he thinksthe enemy would never suppose that he would dream of making a landing insuch an unfavourable position Henceforth it will be known all the worldover as Anzac[45] CoveThe boats and destroyers steal in towards the land They are now closeto the shore and the troops perceive that they must fight for afooting Turkish soldiers are seen running along the beach ready to givethe boats a warm reception Not a word is spoken our men remainperfectly still and quiet awaiting the enemys fire A few momentsmore and bullets rain down on them Many a man has breathed his lastbefore the boats run agroundThe keels have not touched the sand when the Australians of the 3rdBrigade spring out of their boats A blaze of fire sweeps against themfrom the Turkish trenches on the beach but they heed it not With fixedbayonets they dash forward as though they mean to conquer the wholepeninsula by one mighty rush On they go and the Turks flee beforethem The beach is carried with cold steel and in open order they diveinto the scrub and scramble up the hundred feet of cliff that risesbefore them The famous exploit at Wolfes Cove when the Heights ofAbraham were scaled is altogether outdone[46]Now they are on the top of the cliff and come under the main Turkishfire The ground however gives them good cover and they speedily digthemselves in By seven in the morning they are holding the cliff topMeanwhile the 1st and 2nd Brigades have come ashore and two batteriesof Indian Mountain Artillery have been landed The enemy is now shellingthe transports and they are obliged to stand out to sea Furtherartillery cannot therefore be put ashore just yet By noon more than10000 men are on the beach or are climbing the gully and the ravineThe thousand yards of shore is covered with busy workingparties Storesare being landed the Royal Engineers are making roads and wirelessstations are being erected and all the time Turkish shells are fallingfast and thick Our warships are at work but the morning sun is in theeyes of the gunners and they fire at a disadvantageThe Australians on the cliff top have not been content to remain idle intheir hastilydug trenches They rashly push on across three ridges andactually come within sight of the Narrows but now the enemy is stronglyreinforced and they are driven back with heavy loss Stretcherbearersare stumbling down the steep paths and across the beach carrying theirfreight of wounded to the hospital ships on the bulletsplashed seaThere is much confusion as the advancing troops meet those who areretiring but before noon a semicircular position on the cliffs isfirmly held Parties of the 9th and 10th Battalions charge and put outof action three of the enemys Krupp gunsThe Turks now begin their counterattacks which continue far into thenight Again and again our men make bayonet charges and the line holdsfast They have suffered terribly but they have made good theirfooting and are firmly placed at Gaba Tepe on Anzac territory                           Now we must hurry southwards and see how matters are faring at Beach YThree cruisersDublin Amethyst and Sapphirehave covered thelanding of the 1st Battalion Kings Own Scottish Borderers and thePlymouth Marine Battalion The men have leaped ashore on a narrowstrip of sand at the foot of a crumbling scrubcovered cliff 200 feethigh They climb to the top of the cliffs by means of a number of smallgullies and there establish themselves almost without loss Foodwater and ammunition are hauled up Now the Turks begin to attack themand are fiercely resisted Later in the day the enemy largelyreinforced advances from the direction of Krithia and our men have todig in Against them the Turks launch attack after attack supported byheavy guns Owing to the sharp fall of the ground behind the cliffs ourwarships can render but little assistance Through the afternoon andnight the attacks continue and our men make several desperate bayonetcharges But it is clear even now that they cannot maintain themselvesin this position By seven oclock on the morning of the 26th the KingsOwn Scottish Borderers have lost half their number including theirgallant colonelThe order for withdrawal is given A small rearguard of the Kings OwnScottish Borderers with desperate valour holds off the enemy while therest with their wounded stores and ammunition reembark and aresafely brought round to the southern end of the peninsula The landingat Y has failed and our losses have been very heavy but the pluckystand of the two battalions has prevented large numbers of the enemyfrom going to the assistance of their comrades at other points whereas you will soon learn a very touchandgo struggle is in progress                           A short journey southward brings us to Beach X where the 1st RoyalFusiliers have been landed The Swiftsure has plastered the highground with shells and the Implacable which has anchored closeinshore is bringing every gun to bear on the Turkish position Withoutlosing a single man the Fusiliers push up a low cliff and entrenchthemselves By evening they are in touch with their comrades at Beach WA Turkish battery which gets the range of our men is knocked out by afine shot from the Implacable At Beach X everything is going well                           We now hurry away to Beach W between Cape Tekke and Cape Helles Here adoubtful battle is raging The beach consists of deep powdery sand andis 350 yards long with steep ground on the flank and sand dunes in thecentre The Turks have turned this beach into a perfect deathtrapClose to the waters edge there is a broad wire entanglement running thewhole length of the shore and in front of it in the shallow sea thereis another similar barricade There are lines of trenches on the highground machine guns are tucked away into holes in the cliff sniperslurk in the scrub and there is not an inch of the shore which cannot beswept by deadly fire On a hill overlooking the beach there are tworedoubts and elsewhere in the line of possible advance there are otherformidable obstacles Land mines and sea mines have been laid and theTurks may well boast that no invader will ever remain alive on thisterrible beachLancashire men are now about to perform one of the finest feats of armsever achieved by British soldiers or by any other soldiers They areabout to storm this deathtrap from open boats Hereafter as a tributeto their splendid valour Beach W will be known as Lancashire LandingAt six in the morning of the 25th eight picket boats in line abreasteach boat towing four ships cutters packed with men of the 1stBattalion Lancashire Fusiliers approach the shore As soon as shallowwater is reached the tows are cast off and oars are plied The firstboat touches the shore and out spring the Fusiliers to be met by ahurricane of lead from the Turkish trenches Many a man receives hisdeathwound while waistdeep in the water but the unfaltering Fusiliersrush ashore and though fired at from the right the left and thecentre begin hacking their way through the wire A long line of men isat once mown down as by a scythe but the remainder now covered by theguns of the warships and helped by the flanking fire of a party whichhas secured a foothold on a small ledge of rock under the cliff breakthrough the entanglements and rapidly reforming hurl themselves onthe Turkish trenches Several land mines are exploded but nothing canstem the torrent of the British advance By ten oclock three lines ofthe enemys trenches are in our handsOn the right some of the Fusiliers have come under the fire of aredoubt and they can make but little headway in this direction Theedge of the wire entanglements is reached but they can go no furtherThey are now lying under the scanty cover of a sandbank cleaning theirrifles which have been wetted by seawater and choked with sandThe guns of the warships boom out and a rain of shells falls near theredoubt About 2 pm the Worcester Regiment dashes forward Men hacktheir way through the entanglements and in spite of heavy lossescarry the redoubt by storm Now an attempt is made to join hands withthe troops which are in dire peril on Beach V but the defences are toostrong to be broken through Men are seen under an awful fire calmlysnipping the wire as though they were pruning a vineyard But the troopsare worn out by their long labours under a hot sun and the attack isperforce suspended When night falls the Turks make assault afterassault on the wearied invaders So hard pressed are they that even theworking parties on the beach have to be flung into the trenches in orderthat the line may be held Happily the attacks of the enemy are beatenoff and no ground is lost So the night passes and the dawn ushers inanother day of struggle and anxiety                           Now we hurry off to Beach V where tragic events are taking place BeachV resembles an old Greek theatre There is a stretch of sand as at BeachW and running along it is a low sandy ridge four feet high whichaffords some shelter Beyond rise grassy terraces to a height of 100feet The rising ground is flanked on the one side by an old castleand on the other side by a modern fort On the heights overlooking theshore the Turks have massed artillery machine guns and riflemen Onthe very margin of the beach there is an exceedingly strong barbedwirefence and twothirds of the way up there is an even stronger obstacleFrom all sides the defenders can pour down a deadly fire on the landingparties So strongly defended is this beach that special arrangementshave been made to cope with it Large doors have been cut in the steelplates of a collier the River Clyde and wide gangplank have beenslung from her side These gangways slope gradually down from the doorsto her bows so that men can pass along on both sides in single fileand jump on to the lighters which she will tow in with her Her bridgehas been turned into a little fortress and behind steel plates andsandbags in her bows there are twelve machine guns to cover thelanding Two thousand men of the Hampshires and Munster Fusiliers havebeen stowed on board and now she steams bow on to the shore close to areef of rock The lighters are placed in position so as to form a bridgebetween the gangway and the rock[Illustration The Lancashire Fusiliers landing on Beach WBy permission of The Illustrated London NewsYou will read a full account of this heroic landing on pages 211 212Three Victoria Crosses were afterwards awarded to those who haddisplayed the most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty by the voteof their comrades]Eight boatloads of Dublin Fusiliers towed by steam pinnaces make a dashfor the shore Every kind of missile is hurled at them and the mensuffer horribly Some few manage to gain the beach and take refuge underthe sandbank already mentioned None of the boats however push offagain They and their crews are destroyedNow comes the moment for the River Clyde like the horse of Troy topour forth its living freight but there is grievous delay for thecurrent runs strongly and there is grave difficulty in keeping thelighters in position The splendid pluck and tenacity of the navalworkingparty are tried to the utmost and many splendid deeds ofheroism are accomplished before the bridge of boats holds fast Now acompany of the Munster Fusiliers followed by a second company issuesfrom the ship and strives to cross the shifting and swaying bridge Thelighters give way in the current the end one nearest the shore driftsinto deep water and many men striving to swim from it to the beach aredrowned All the time a perfect tornado of fire sweeps down upon them Athird company essays the task the lighters are filled with dead andwounded A thousand men have striven to land but barely five hundredhave got ashore So hot is the Turkish fire that the remaining men inthe River Clyde dare not emerge A man has only to show his head to beinstantly picked off                           Twentyfour hours after the River Clyde runs ashore there are but thesurvivors of the Dublin and the Munster Fusiliers and two companies ofthe Hampshire Regiment on the beach and they are still crouchingbeneath the shelter of the sandy ridge Early in the morning theCornwallis Albion and Queen Elizabeth come to the rescue andbegin a heavy bombardment of the enemy Under cover of this bombardmentthe men on the beach push up the slopes on the bluff under a mostgalling fire and capture the village a fort and a hill The landingcan now go forward By the evening of Tuesday the 27th Beach V is inworking orderThe whole scene on the beach reminds you of a gigantic shipwreck Itlooks as if the whole army with its stores had been washed ashore aftera great gale or had saved themselves on rafts All this work is carriedon under an incessant shrapnel fire which sweeps the trenches and hillsThe shells are frequently bursting ten or twelve at the same momentmaking a deafening noise and plastering the foreshore with bullets Theonly safe place is close under the cliff but every one is rapidlybecoming accustomed to the shriek of the shells and the splash ofbullets in the water and the work goes on as if there was not a gunwithin miles                           Before I conclude this account of the landing I must say a word as tothe part played by the French in the operations Their duty was to landon the Asiatic shore at Kum Kale and engage the batteries so that theycould not interfere with the landings at Beaches V and S During askirmish which took place on the height at Kum Kale and on the Trojanplain the French took 500 prisoners and would have captured more hadthere been room for them in the boats This French diversion enabledtrawlers to land 700 men of the 2nd South Wales Borderers at Beach S Astiff little fight followed but the Welshmen gained the top of thecliff and digging themselves in managed to hold their own until theposition was taken over by the French Their landing had only cost themfifty casualties A company was also put ashore at Camber a little boatharbour nestling just east and under the ruined fort of SeddulBahrThis little force however met with such a fierce fire that it couldmake no progress up the steep cliffs towards the village and had to bewithdrawn                           Thus the landing was made and a feat believed to be impossible wasperformed When we consider how strongly the Turks were posted howskilfully their trenches were made how completely the beaches wereswept by their fire we are lost in admiration of the superb gallantryand contempt of life displayed by our men You will read on a later pagesome account of those who specially distinguished themselves but do notforget that many heroes who deserved the Victoria Cross had laid downtheir lives before the tops of the cliffs were reached We were on thepeninsula at last but our footing was very insecure We had our backsto the sea and our faces to a stubborn foe who was holding positions ofenormous strength In later chapters we shall learn how these positionsbaffled every effort of the most heroic of men to carry them For themoment however we were flushed with victory and our hopes were high[Footnote 45 Made up of the initial letters of the wordsAustralianNew Zealand Army Corps][Footnote 46 On the night of September 1213 1759 General Wolfesarmy of 4000 men climbed a wooded precipice on hands and knees andnext day defeated a French army on the plateau Heights of Abraham tothe southwest of Quebec This victory gave us Canada]  CHAPTER XXXV  HEROES OF THE LANDINGNow that you have read an account of how we gained a foothold and nomore than a foothold on the Gallipoli peninsula you will agree with methat only an army of heroes could have performed the feat All foughtmagnificently but the Anzacs carried off the palm A correspondenttells us that one man renowned for his height and great strengthjumped into a Turkish trench and bayoneted five men one after the otherhurling each of them over the parapet as coolly and as easily as if hehad been tossing hay Hundreds of grim tales of this kind are told ofthe Australians fierce onset Wounded men who emerged from the struggleshouted to those who cheered them We are going to do better when weget back They described the fighting as a great gamethe best gamewe ever had We made them run said one Australian We wanted to letthe Turks know what Australian steel was like and they ran screechingand howling before us Two New Zealanders were seen chasing elevenTurks who fled in terror before them                           Bugler W S Manchip of the 1st Australian Imperial Force thus describesthe desperate fighting in which he took part When we were near theshore a signal light flashed two or three times but the boat I was inran up the beach and several of us were safe ashore before a rifle shotsplit the air Then almost immediately a perfect shower of bullets fellaround us Fixing bayonets the boys charged the hills without firing ashot until the light of the dawn was sufficient to enable them to makesure of their aim Although I passed several dead Turks on my wayforward I only saw two who had been bayoneted for most of them did notwait for a taste of that eighteen inches of cold steel but ran snipingat us whenever they got the chance until we had them back about twomiles when we emerged from the undergrowth and broken country on to astretch of flat land There we were met by a perfect fusillade fromthousands of rifles and we had to take what cover we could which wasnot much After being under the withering fire of the Turkish rifles andmachine guns which were well entrenched for nearly an hour the enemyopened fire on us with shrapnel and it was terrible as we were unableto move and men were falling around us by the dozen    In the nightthey charged upon our trenches blowing bugles and shouting AllahAllah When the order was given to Fix bayonets Charge they did notwait for us but fled back to their trenches About four oclock onWednesday I was passing across an open space in the trench with a tin ofwater when a bullet struck me in the back cutting through myequipment tunic jersey and braces The latter being made of hardleather stopped the course of the bullet and I only received a bruiseon my back                           A writer in Blackwoods Magazine thus describes the landing of theKOSBs on Beach Y It is no time to dwell on what might have beenbut I cannot deny myself mention of the fact that we were actually onthe slopes of Achi Baba that first day thanks to the dauntlessKOSBs who pushed through from Y Beach to Krithia almost unopposedfought their way through the ruins on to the farther slopesand thenowing to lack of supports marched all the way back again under adevastating fire In the advance the battalions losses were smallcoming back they were dreadfully punished and at last dug themselves inon the seaward

serving soldier one of the eighty odd menstill alive who won to the gently rising slopes of this formidableposition a bone in our throats for six deadly monthsand there still                           Corporal J Collins of the 1st Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers gives us aglimpse of the terrible scenes which took place on Beach W where themen of his regiment covered themselves with glory In my first boathe says there were thirtyeight soldiers and four sailors and when wegot near the shore the boat drifted about so I decided to make forland I got into the water and being a strong swimmer I was able topull one of my comrades on to my shoulder Thus we struggled ashoreThen we stumbled across barbed wire The sand and the water choked myrifle and I was unable to use it when I landed except the bayonet Westruggled through the entanglements and made for the cliffs whilebullets were whistling and shrapnel shrieking all round us While I wasadvancing a shrapnel shell whistled past my breast tearing myammunition pouch away and reducing my clothes to tatters The sameshell killed some of my comrades farther in the line Keeping on wetook the first Turkish trench                           Leading Seaman Gilligan of HMS Euryalus thus wrote We landed theLancashire Fusiliers thirtyfive in each boat I shall never forget itas long as I live It was wicked and I like a lot more never expectedto come through it whole There were four boats in tow of a steampinnace and there was no sign of the enemy until we touched the shoreThen they opened fire strongly entrenched above us in the cliffs withmachine guns As soon as we touched the beach we could see the wireentanglements The fire was terriblejust like a hailstorm I jumpedout of the stern up to my arms in water and pushed the boat in Thesergeant jumped in front of me and got mortally wounded The cries ofthe wounded were terrible It is without equal in this war this landingof troops under fire The Turks drove our men right back to the beachthat Sunday night There were 38000 Turks and 1100 of our fellowsheld them However we have made progress since then and I am proud tohave had a share in it[Illustration The Landing

When the River Clyde was runashore a floating bridge of lighters was formed The swirling currentdrove the lighters adrift and the bridge was broken Observing thisCommander Unwin left the River Clyde and standing waist deep in thewater under a murderous fire endeavoured to get the lighters intoposition again He worked on until suffering from the effects of thecold water he was obliged to return to the ship where he was wrappedin blankets Having somewhat recovered he returned to his work againstthe doctors orders and completed it Later on he was slightly woundedby three bullets but as soon as the doctor had attended to him he oncemore left the ship this time in a lifeboat to save some wounded menwho were lying in shallow water near the beach He continued at thislabour of mercy under constant fire until he was so worn out that hecould no longer standMidshipman Drewry assisted Commander Unwin in the work of getting thelighters into position and toiled on utterly regardless of the heavyfire He was twice hit but even when wounded he tried to swim fromlighter to lighter with a line and only gave up the effort when he wasthoroughly exhausted An observer saw him swimming to a lighter with aline in his mouth and a wound in his head while rocks lighters andboats were covered with dead and dying When he was utterly worn outMidshipman Malleson took the line swam to the second

diversion that did not succeeda sideshowthat failed I shall not therefore describe the progress of thefighting in full detail The story is rather a footnote to the historyof the Great War than part of the text We may divide the storyasCsar did Gaulinto three parts Part I deals with the fighting fromthe day of the landing on 25th April down to 13th July and tells how webattered at the Achi Baba barrier while the Anzacs strove to carry thehigh and rugged hills on their front Part II carries on the story tothe middle fortnight of August when with the aid of five newdivisions we made a big effort to break through at Suvla and Anzac andPart III describes the long period of waiting until those December andJanuary days when we came off the peninsula without the loss of asingle life In this chapter I shall give you very briefly Part I ofthe storyOn the night of 27th April the Allies lay on a line running across thepeninsula about three miles north of Cape Tekke Next day at eight inthe morning an advance was made on the village of Krithia and thoughthe Turks strongly opposed us the 87th Brigade on the left advancedtwo miles while the French on the right pushed forward a mile By theevening of the 27th we securely held the tip of the peninsula Duringthe fighting the Queen Elizabeth far out at sea observed 250 of theenemy preparing to make an attack from a point where they could not beseen by the troops on shore Immediately she dropped a shrapnel shellamongst them It weighed 1800 pounds and contained 13000 bulletsWhen the smoke cleared away it was discovered that the attacking partyhad been completely wiped outOn 1st May after we had been reinforced the Turks made a fiercecounterattack and what is known as the First Battle of Krithiabegan[48] All day their big guns roared and at night when the moonrose their infantry darted forward On the right where the shellinghad been heaviest the Turks opened a gap in our lines but it waspromptly filled up by the 5th Royal Scots who with the bayonet clearedthe Turks out of the trenches which they had occupied All night thebattle raged and we only held on to our position with the greatestdifficulty At dawn the next day we counterattacked and the whole linemoved forward five hundred yards Had the French not been held up on theright by barbed wire and concealed machine guns we should have carriedAchi Baba that day Severe fighting went on during the 4th and the 5thand our casualties were very heavy Between the day of the landing and6th May we lost 14000 men 3593 of whom had been cut off in thedifficult country and made prisonersThe Second Battle of Krithia which began on 6th May lasted for threedays Our left and centre strove to carry Krithia ridge while theFrench attempted to get across the small river beyond Morto Bay whichyou see on the map The French 75s and the guns of the warships openedfire and prepared the way for the advance Again however our Allieswere held up by concealed Turkish trenches but they struggled on andby the close of the day at the cost of many lives pushed across theriver During the night they held their ground in spite of a strongcounterattack Next day the warships shelled the Turkish right and wecarried the front Turkish trenches but could go no farther On theright the French advanced but caught by shrapnel wavered and fledThe lost ground however was recovered So the fight went on everyinch being bought at a heavy price At the close of the three daysstruggle we had won a thousand yards but had not touched the enemysmain position which was terribly strong We now knew that it could notbe rushedWhile these battles were going on the Anzacs were slowly gaining groundat Gaba Tepe On the night of 18th May fresh bodies of Turks were flungagainst their trenches but the cool and steady shooting of the men fromdown under kept them at bay On that red day the Turks lost some 7000men while the Australians lost but 500 The Turkish trenches were insome places less than two hundred yards away from those of the Anzacsand the ground between was carpeted with dead You will read on a laterpage how LanceCorporal Jacka won the Victoria Cross by capturing atrench singlehandedThe third great attempt upon Krithia and Achi Baba was made on 4th Junebut though our men fought like heroes and the East LancashireTerritorial Division on the right centre made a splendid advance weonly gained some five hundred yards on a front of three miles Afterfive weeks desperate struggle we had not touched the outer Turkishposition The German engineers had made it almost as formidable as theLabyrinth in Artois It was clear that without large reinforcements wecould make no headway Already we had lost 38636 menmore than thewhole casualty list for three years of the South African WarThe British and French fleets had taken part in every attack and so farhad been almost unmolested Now German submarines began to appear butbefore they got to work a Turkish destroyer managed to sink the oldBritish battleship Goliath by means of a torpedo On 26th May a Germansubmarine launched a torpedo which tore through the nets of theTriumph and sank her in nine minutes Next day the Majestic whensteaming close to the shore was sunk in the same manner It was nowevident that our ships could no longer take part in the bombardment andescape the submarines so most of them were sent home and the Alliednaval strength was reduced to a few of the older battleships andcruisers together with destroyers and one of the monitors which hadchecked the shoreward march of the Germans on the Flemish coast Othernew monitors arrived later and being submarineproof were able to doexcellent workBy midsummer we knew more than ever how necessary it was that a rightof way should be forced through the Dardanelles We shall learn in alater chapter that the Russians had been forced back and were terriblyhard pressed Without an open searoad by which they could be suppliedwith munitions it seemed likely that they would be put out of actionfor months to come and that the Germans would be able to spare largebodies of troops to reinforce the Western front We therefore determinedto push on in the peninsula with renewed vigour Reinforcements had nowbeen landed and it was necessary that we should strike and strike hardat onceDuring the first fortnight of June the enemy made many attempts tothrust us from the positions which we had won and during the fightingmany notable deeds of heroism were done by our men A very determinedattack by the Turks on 18th June carried some of our trenches but theywere won back by a brilliant charge of the 5th Royal Scots and a companyof the 4th Worcesters You will remember that the 5th Royal Scots hadalready distinguished themselves on 1st May They formed part of whatSir Ian Hamilton calls the incomparable 29th DivisionOn 21st June we began the work of straightening out our line which thenformed an awkward salient in the centre After a heavy bombardment theFrench infantry rushed two lines of Turkish trenches Most desperatefighting followed in which every gun that could be brought to bear wasturned on the enemy Six hundred yards were won and the whole Alliedright wing was well beyond the little river already mentioned Thoughmany of the French were little more than boys they fought with theutmost dash and contempt of deathThe right wing having advanced an attempt was now made to bring up theleft The movement began on the morning of 28th June with a fiercebombardment When it ceased at 1045 our infantry leaped forward andwithin half an hour had won three lines of trenches between a ravine andthe sea East of the ravine the 7th Royal Scots made good progress butthe right met with a heavy fire and could gain but little ground Asecond attack which began at 1130 was magnificently made The mendashed forward without wavering and before long our left wing was lessthan a mile west of Krithia The whole of the ravine which was litteredwith dead rifles bayonets boxes of ammunition soldiers packsfirewood etc was in our hands Much booty and about 200 prisonerswere taken and our losses were not more than 1750On the last day of June there was fighting all round the peninsula Inthe Anzac territory about midnight Enver Pasha came specially fromConstantinople to see his army drive the Australians and New Zealandersinto the sea Heavy firing began to which the Anzacs replied withcheers At 130 in the morning a strong column of Turks advanced but itwas broken to atoms by the rifles and machine guns of the 7th and 8thLight Horse Other attacks melted away before the swift and deadly fireof the defenders and Enver Pasha returned to Constantinople adisappointed manEarly on the morning of the same day the French had a success Theycarried by storm a network of trenches at the head of the river alongwhich they had been fighting so long and held on to the ground whichthey had won Sir Ian Hamilton thought that the Turkish losses duringthe five days following 28th June were over 20000 yet all thissacrifice had availed them nothingThe July fighting was of the same nature as that of June On 4th July anenemy warship fired on the Australian lines and aeroplanes tried todrop bombs on our trenches This was followed by an infantry attackwhich was successful at first but later on the Turks were forced toretire with great loss We were now up against the main strength of theAchi Baba fortress and on 12th July we made a resolute attempt tocapture itThe bombardment began at dawn and the first attack was made by theFrench and the Scottish Lowland Division on the right and right centreThe Scots reached the third line of Turkish trenches but they losttouch with the French on their right and could not hold their gainsAnother and even fiercer cannonade began at four in the afternoon andthe Scots surging forward against a great Turkish redoubt overlooking aravine carried it at the point of the bayonet By dusk some 400 yardsof ground had been gained Through the night the Turks came on again andagain with bombs and the wearied Scots were obliged to give up twolines of trenches Next day these positions were recaptured and therewe stuck We had reached the limit of our advance from the south Wewere very near to Krithia but the heights of Achi Baba were as far offas ever                           The following officers and men won the Victoria Cross during the MayJune and July fightingLanceCorporal Albert Jacka 14th Battalion Australian Imperial forcesA private of LanceCorporal Jackas regiment thus describes the deedwhich won his chum the VC There were four Bendigo boys all matesin the 14th and Bert Jacka and I were two of them The 14th wasstationed at Courtneys Post which shared with Quinns Post[49] andPopes Hill all the worst of the fighting during the month of May Onthe night of 18th May and the morning of the next day the Turks tried todrive us into the sea and left eight acres of dead between Quinns andCourtneys In the middle of the scrap a wounded man crawled to ourtrench and said the Turks had rushed a communication trench and therewas only one man keeping them back There was a call for volunteers andI was one of them When we got near we saw Bert guarding the end of thetrench with his bayonet He looked like a mad thing When he saw uscoming he let out a roar like a bull and rushed into the trench I madeafter him but I received two bullets one in the side and the other inthe hand Well down I went and before the others got into the trenchBert had done it on his own Five shot and two killed with the bayonetHe came to see me that night in the dugout and I said to him WellBert youve done a big thing all he replied was I think I lost myhead For this most gallant deed Jacka received not only the covetedcross but a sum of 500 and a gold medal promised by Mr John Wren ofMelbourne to the first Australian who should win the great distinctionSecond Lieutenant George Dallas Moor 3rd Battalion Hampshire RegimentThis young officer was not nineteen when by his splendid bravery andpresence of mind he saved a dangerous situation On 5th June adetachment of a battalion on his left which had lost all its officerswas rapidly retiring before a heavy Turkish attack Second LieutenantMoor grasped the peril in which the rest of the line was thus placedand racing back for some two hundred yards he stemmed the rout ledback the leaderless and at their head recaptured the lost trench InSeptember 1914 he was a schoolboy at Cheltenham nine months later hehad proved himself a born leader of men and had won the proudest badgeof honour that a soldier can wearSecond Lieutenant Herbert James 4th Battalion Worcestershire RegimentTwo fine deeds of outstanding valour stand to the credit of LieutenantJames On 28th June he rallied a retiring party belonging to aneighbouring unit and led it forward under heavy shell and rifle fireHe then returned gathered together another party and once moreadvanced thus putting new life into the attack On 3rd July he headed aparty of bomb throwers who pushed up a Turkish communication trench andafter nearly all of his comrades had been killed or wounded remainedalone at the head of the trench exposed to a murderous fire butbeating back the enemy singlehanded till a barrier had been builtbehind him and the trench secured Lieutenant James was a Birminghamman who enlisted in the 21st Lancers in 1908 He was of a studiousdisposition and had won several prizes for languages On the outbreak ofwar he was granted a commission and joined the famous WorcestershiresCaptain Gerald OSullivan 1st Battalion Royal Inniskilling FusiliersThis gallant Irishman threw himself into the breach to the southwest ofKrithia during a critical moment on the night of the 1st2nd July Hevolunteered to lead a party of bomb throwers against a British trenchwhich the Turks had captured Advancing in the open under very heavyfire he climbed on to the parapet and hurled his bombs into the crowdof men below Of course he was wounded but not before his example hadinspired his men to such efforts that they recaptured the lost trenchStrange to say the day after his honour was announced he was reportedmissingSergeant James Somers 1st Battalion Royal Inniskilling FusiliersOn the same night that Captain OSullivan so distinguished himselfSergeant Somers of the same regiment pushed into an enemy trench andbombed the Turks with great effect Later on he advanced into the openunder heavy fire and held back the enemy by throwing bombs until abarricade had been erected Frequently he ran back to his own trenchfor a fresh supply of bombs Thanks to his gallantry and coolness thelost portion of a British trench was recovered On his return to hisnative village the people of North Tipperary gave him a great receptionand presented him with an illuminated address and war stock to the valueof 240[Footnote 48 Refer to map on p 168][Footnote 49 Quinns Post lay at the head of Shrapnel Valley theValley of Death referred to on page 273 Popes Hill lay to the leftfront of Quinns Post and Courtneys Post was on the right of QuinnsPost]  CHAPTER XXXVII  A SPLENDID FAILUREIn his dispatch of 6th January 1916 Sir Ian Hamilton tells us that earlyin July 1915 he was fully aware that the Kilid Bahr plateau could not bereached from the south Even if he could capture Krithia which had sofar defied him he could make no further headway towards his goal TheTurks had made new and very strong works on the slopes of Achi Baba andthese works were so planned that even if the enemys western flankcould be turned and he could be driven back from the coast the centraland eastern portions of the mountain could still be held as a bastion tothe plateau After considering every possible means of forcing a way tothe Narrows he decided to make an advance through the Anzac territoryand the country to the north of itFor three months Anzac had been an area of little more than a squaremile of cliff top on the edge of the sea Its defences consisted of aseries of outposts and these could only be reached by means of a deepravine Shrapnel Valley or the Valley of Death as it was calledbecause it was enfiladed by Turkish fire and a man took his life in hishand every time he attempted to pass through it You have already heardof some of these outposts Quinns Post was named after Major Quinn whodied in defence of it during a desperate Turkish attack on 28th MayCourtneys Post which was the scene of Corporal Jackas famous exploitwas named after the Colonel who held it against terrible odds for sevenweeks Popes Hill received its name from Colonel Pope of WestAustraliaPope with the Pipe as his men dubbed him because on oneoccasion when he was climbing the side of the hill he just escaped aTurkish trap by leaping down thirty feet on to a soft spit of sandwhere he landed safely pipe and all The path to the post of PopesHill was so steep that the men had to help themselves up by means of aropeSir Ian Hamilton now determined to make a new landing on Suvla Baywhich lies to the north of the Anzac region Look at the diagram on page278 and make out the chief features of the neighbourhood You noticethat the bay which is about two miles wide is like the crescent moonin shape with capes forming the horns Along the edge of the bay runs anarrow causeway of sand and behind it is a salt lake dry in summerbut overflowing in winter Lining the coast northeastwards from CapeSuvla is the ridge of Karakol Dagh over 400 feet high Between thesouthern end of the lake and the promontory which shuts in the bay onthe south side is the low hill of Lala Baba and about one and a halfmiles to the east of it is another elevation afterwards called by ourmen Chocolate Hill because it was burnt brown by the shells which burstupon it[Illustration The Anzac FrontThe watercourses shown on the map are mostly dry in summer]Find on the map page 275 Azmak Dere a ravine which lies to the southof Chocolate Hill From this ravine northwards stretches a series ofhills and flats on which there are farms and patches of dwarf oaks andon the seaward fall of the hills thick scrub Everywhere the plain iscracked by watercourses which are simply deep dry gullies in summerJust north of the upper course of the Azmak Dere is one of the twoAnafarta villages the other stands two miles farther north Between thesouth village and the foothills of the Karakol Dagh lie the AnafartaHillsAt the points marked A B and C on the diagram page 278 Sir IanHamilton proposed to make new landings but as a matter of fact histroops were put ashore only at B and C They were to try to carry theAnafarta Hills and their right was to link up with the left of theAnzacs who would advance at the same time If this were done thecentral crest of the spine of uplands which runs through the western endof the peninsula would be in our hands We should then be able tocommand the one land route to Maidos on the Narrows the communicationsof the Turks would be cut Achi Baba would fall and in due course weshould reach the plateau on which all our hopes were centred Such wasthe plan It was a bold plan and it had a very fair chance ofsucceedingOf course if the Turks got wind of what we proposed to do they wouldmake preparations to resist us and the conditions in the south of thepeninsula would be repeated The landing on Suvla Bay was to be asurprise We knew that the Turks had made no preparations in thisregion and we hoped to take them unawares If the landing could be madespeedily if the troops could push forward without delay and if theyand the Anzacs working together could join hands and gain the crest ofthe spine of uplands all would be well but if there were delays ifany of the various columns were not up to time or failed to do the workassigned to them the whole movement would end in failure[Illustration Suvla Bay and the NeighbourhoodBy permission of The SphereThe landing took place on August 67 1915 A beach where a landing wasattempted was later abandoned and the troops were put ashore at B andC Notice the causeway across the Salt Lake Lala Baba Chocolate Hilland Lone Pine Plateau to the southeast of Shrapnel Valley]Before the great venture began Sir Ian Hamilton had to throw the enemyoff the scent It would never do to let him know where the new landingwas to be made At all costs he must be surprised So on 6th August ageneral attack was made on the Turkish position at Achi Baba This wasdone to make the enemy believe that we still hoped to carry the ridgefrom the south In the early afternoon after the guns had prepared theway the 88th Brigade advanced across open ground against a part of theenemys front which so far we had been unable to win The attack wasboldly made but our men were held up and suffered heavy losses Eastof the Krithia road the Lancashire Territorials fared better and gained200 yards Next morning the Turks with heavy reinforcements begantheir counterattacks and fighting raged for two days round a vineyardwest of the Krithia road where as you will learn later LieutenantForshaw of the 19th Manchesters won the Victoria Cross All thisfighting you must remember was for the purpose of making the Turksbelieve that we were going to carry on in the old wayNow we must turn to the Anzac territory which as we know was to bethe scene of a great effort On the nights of the 4th 5th and 6thAugust reinforcements were slipped into Anzac very silently during thedarkest hours and were tucked away in prepared hidingplaces quiteinvisible to the aeroplanes or the telescopes of the Turks Probablynever before have so many men been landed under the very eyes of theenemy and kept concealed for three days without being discoveredOn the afternoon of the 6th while the fighting was in progress roundKrithia a frontal attack was made on the Lone Pine plateau[50] It wasa feint to cover the advance of a division which was to move up thecoast and work up three ravines in order to assault Koja Chemen[51] thecommanding summit of the Sari Bair As soon as the bombardment ceasedthe Australiansevery man with a white band on his sleeveleapedforward with that magnificent dash which has given them a leading placeamongst the finest soldiers of the world and flung themselves on thedeep and roofedin trenches at Lone Pine which you see to thesoutheast of Shrapnel Valley After a deadly struggle in the dimgalleries they won the whole position It was a magnificent feat ofarms and Sir Ian Hamilton thus sums it up One weak Australianbrigade numbering at the outset but 2000 rifles and supported only bytwo weak battalions carried the work under the eyes of a whole enemydivision and maintained their grip upon it like a vice during six daysof counterattacks    After the first violence of thecounterattacks had abated 1100 corpsesour own and Turkishweredragged out of the trenches Seven Victoria Crosses were awarded to thevictors of Lone PineMeanwhile the columns on the left had occupied the ridge named BauchopsHill and had climbed and seized Big Table Top a mushroomshapedmountain with such steep sides that it was believed no infantry couldscale them But just as faith moves mountains so valour can carrythem The heights were scaled and the plateau was carried by midnightThe attacks were made with bayonet and bomb only hardly a rifle shotwas fired Meanwhile the ridge which you see just south of Azmak Derehad also been captured and the whole left rear of the Anzac positionhad been safeguarded The grand attack on Koja Chemen could now proceedI must break off my story for a moment to tell you that at dawn on the7th the 3rd Australian Light Horse and the 1st Light Horse Brigadepushed forward against the Turkish trenches in their front Thesemagnificent troopers men of great physical strength and of the highestcourage advanced only to be mown down Line after line of them lefttheir parapets but were met by a storm of fire which no mortal couldface and live For a few moments the flag of the Light Horse flutteredfrom a corner of the Turkish position Soon however it disappearedand of the 750 men who attacked that morning only about 100 returnedThe sacrifice however was not in vain The Turks in this part of theline were penned to their trenches while the great attack which I am nowabout to describe went forwardIf you look at the map on page 275 you will see that in order to getfrom Big Table Top to Koja Chemen our troops had to cross RhododendronRidge All night the left column struggled up the two deres which yousee to the east of Bauchops Hill and by a quarter to six in themorning it was on the lower slopes of Rhododendron Ridge It then movedup the hill and gained touch by means of the 10th Gurkhas with a columnon the right which had worked up the ravines between Rhododendron Ridgeand Chunuk Bair in the face of very heavy fire and by means of frequentbayonet charges Before nightfall our men were entrenched on the top ofRhododendron Ridge a quarter of a mile short of Chunuk Bairthat isof victoryNow for the last push The attack on Koja Chemen was timed to begin at415 on the morning of the 8th The right column was to climb up theChunuk Bair ridge while the left was to make for the ridge directlysoutheast of Koja Chemen At the first faint glimmer of dawn observerssaw figures moving against the skyline of Chunuk Bair Were they ourown men or were they the Turks Telescopes were anxiously adjusted thelight grew stronger men were seen climbing up from our side of theridge they were our own fellowsthe topmost summit was ours Yesit was trueNew Zealanders and Maoris had fixed themselves firmly onthe main knoll of Chunuk Bair and victory was in sight The positionhowever had not been won without great losses The 7th Gloucesters forexample lost every single officer yet they fought on from midday tosunset commanded only by corporals and privatesNext morning the 9th the attack was renewed by three columns Thewhole of Chunuk Bair was to be gained and while No 1 column held theground Nos 2 and 3 columns were to carry Hill Q It was a day ofpitiless heat and the men suffered torments of thirst The 6th Gurkhasof the second column scaled the summit of the ridge between Chunuk Bairand Hill Q and for half an hour looked down upon the gleaming waters ofthe straits Not only did they and some of the 6th South Lancashiresreach the crest but they began to attack down the far side of itfiring as they went at the fastretreating enemy But at this suprememoment when the last obstacle had been passed and the Promised Land wasin sight the fortune of war deserted us No 3 column should by thistime have been sweeping out towards Hill Q along the whole ridge of themountain but it was nowhere to be seen It had lost its way in thedarkness There was no support for the men on the summit who were nowsuddenly assailed by a salvo of heavy shells The Gurkhas and SouthLancashires were forced back from the crest and on to the lower slopesfrom which they had started When at last No 3 column appeared theTurks had come up in overwhelming numbers and all hope of regaining thesummit had vanishedThat evening our line ran along Rhododendron Ridge up to the crest ofChunuk Bair where some 800 New Zealanders and Maoris were holding abouttwo hundred yards of shallow trenches unprotected by wire During thenight of the 9th10th these troops were relieved after they had beenfighting without pause for three days and three nights Two battalionsof the New Army took the place of these devoted men who were now halfdead with fatigue Early on the morning of the 10th the Turks made afurious attack upon them They came on again and again calling upon thename of God determined to drive our men into the sea Desperatefighting followed The men of the New Army were simply overwhelmed bysheer weight of numbers and were driven from the crest At the foot ofthe hill they were rallied and plunged into a deadly fray in whichgenerals fought in the ranks and men caught each other by the throat   Our men stood to it and maintained by many a deed of daring theold traditions of their race There was no flinching They died in theranks where they stoodBut where were the men from Suvla Where were they at this supremecrisis when they were so desperately needed The New Zealanders on thecrest of Chunuk Bair had seen them landing but had lost sight of themWhat had happened Something must have gone seriously wrong                           The landing at Suvla Bay was made on the night of 6th August under veryfavourable conditions The moon did not rise until 2 am and by thistime our men were ashore Except for a little rifle fire they werequite unopposed As you know the Turks had their hands full elsewhereand had no inkling of what was afoot The men who landed at the points Band C carried Lala Baba with the bayonet during the night and also anoutpost to the north of the Salt Lake By the time the moon rose twodivisions were ashore and were holding a line east of the lake runningfrom Karakol Dagh to near Chocolate Hill So far everything had gonewell but then came a fatal delay It was essential that we should pushon if we were to surprise the Turks but no attempt was made toproceed The men most of whom had never been in action before werevery weary and were tormented by thirst The transports containingwater stores mules and carts were still sixty miles away and nodoubt the general in command of the expedition hesitated to send menforward in an arid land without a proper water supply Further he hadbut little artillery Late that night the right carried Chocolate HillThe New Zealanders as you know were now struggling to maintain theirfoothold on Chunuk Bair and every moment was priceless Unhappily thegeneral at Suvla Bay does not seem to have realized that the wholesuccess of the movement depended on pushing his men forward at allcosts By this time Sir Ian Hamilton had arrived He tried to persuadethe general to advance but in vain By the morning of Monday 9thAugust our chance of success had almost vanished Evergrowing numbersof the enemy had come up and no surprise was now possibleOn the morning of the 9th a gallant endeavour was made to carry the mainAnafarta ridge but though the crest was won the effort was too lateThe Turks had now arrived in full force About midday they fired thescrub on the hills and the flames which were swept across our front bythe wind drove us back Nothing more of importance was done that dayand next morning our chance of succeeding had gone for everDuring the next ten days we tried to push forward and the famous 29thDivision was brought up but even it could not snatch victory out ofdefeat On 21st August repeated but unavailing efforts were made tocarry a hill to the north and another to the south of Chocolate HillAbout five oclock the mounted division which had been held in reservebelow Lala Baba made a splendid advance For two miles the gallantyeomen moved forward as if on parade through country where there was notenough cover to conceal a mouse and amidst a rain of Turkish shrapnelThese men from Bucks Berks and Dorset charged the hill to the southof Chocolate Hill and leaped into the Turkish trenches The Turkshowever on a higher hill brought machine guns to bear on them and bydaylight they were forced back to their old linesThe same day the Anzacs under their famous leader General Birdwoodbrilliantly carried one side of the topmost knoll of Hill 60 which yousee by the side of the upper course of Azma Dere the southern fork ofAzmak Dere[52] After desperate handtohand fighting ninetenths ofthe summit was won Some 250 men of the 5th Connaught Rangersdistinguished themselves that day by a superb charge and finally thewhole hill passed into our hands With this success our efforts to makeheadway on the peninsula practically came to an endThus was a likely plan turned into a tragedy of missed opportunity Wefailed for the same reason that we failed in the whole campaignwe weretoo late and we gave time for strong forces of the enemy to take uppositions of such strength that all the valour of our men could notcarry them The whole enterprise was wrecked when our troops were heldin check for a whole day on the flats of Suvla Bay                           Last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history on 11thOctober Sir Ian Hamilton was asked to say what he supposed would be theextent of our losses if we tried to get off the peninsula He cabledback that he could not even think of such a thing On the 16th he wasrecalled and another general Sir Charles Monro who had alreadyadvised that we should withdraw from Gallipoli was appointed in hisplace The task of the new general was to carry out the delicate anddifficult operation of withdrawal During the next two months he wasbusily engaged in making his preparationsOf course it was allimportant that the Turks should be kept inignorance of what we proposed to do Our losses in getting on to thepeninsula were very heavy but they would be as nothing compared withthose which we might suffer in getting off should the Turks be enabledto attack us while men guns horses and stores were being transferredto the ships Some generals gloomily told us that we should lose halfor at least onethird of our troops in the process We therefore madeno sign but carried on as though we had no thought of leaving thepeninsula at allLocal fighting still went on mines were laid and exploded and a trenchwarfare similar to that in North France and Flanders was in full swingThe storms of November broke over our men and torrents roared down thegullies Sickness was rife but still carry on was the order of theday On 21st December Lord Kitchener visited Anzac and satisfiedhimself that the men could be withdrawn without undue loss The hour ofdeparture was drawing very nearEverything depended on the weather The small boats in which the troopswere to be conveyed to the transports could not work in a rough sea norcould the guns and animals be got off during storms Happily when thework of withdrawal began on 29th December a spell of light wind andsmooth seas set inBefore the men could depart the Turks had to be attacked so as to keepthem at a distance On 29th December a British division advanced againstthe enemy with as much dash as if the campaign was only beginning andnext day the Turkish lines were fiercely bombarded Meanwhile the firsttroops had got away All sorts of ruses were invented to deceive theTurks It is said for example that while 2000 men were silentlyembarked at night 500 were landed with great show the next morning inorder to make the Turks believe that we were actually being reinforcedFor weeks guides were trained to bring down companies of men from thetrenches to the beaches during the night and so well was everythingplanned that every man every animal and every gun with the exceptionof six was safely embarked The landing was a feat the departure was amiracle[Illustration The Turkish Attack on our Troops

slouching gait Except for the moonlight shimmering on the SaltLake and the smooth waters of the bay and the fires burning in thedeserted camps all was dark Suddenly four great fires sprang upleaped into flames and grew into one mighty bonfire The desertedstores of the Anzacs were blazing furiously Then as a finale a giantmine was exploded by electricity under the Turkish trenches It was theAustralians Goodbye to the Turks An Anzac corporal thus describedthe departure    On the last night we kept up the usual firing until finally    there were only sixty men from each battalion scattered along    the firingline and through a rusedue to the inventive    faculties of Corporal Scurry of our battalionthese last men    were able to get away    Scurry invented an apparatus by fixing a kerosene can full of    water which was allowed to drip into a large jam tin This    latter was tied on to the trigger of a rifle fully cocked and in    position on the parapet When a sufficient amount of water was    in the jam tin off went the gun    Hundreds of these were fixed all along the line timed to go    off at different intervals so that the usual firing was kept up    for two hours after the last man had left the trenches    Some ruseeh whatI hope sir said a New Zealander to his officer as he crept downShrapnel Gully for the last time that those fellows who lie buriedalong the Dere will be soundly sleeping and not hear us as we marchaway Many of his comrades however put aside such sad thoughtsAs the last transport steamed away early on the morning of 9th January1916 the enemys guns began to pour shells on our deserted trenches andon our burning beaches A day or two later the Turks announced that theyhad driven the British into the sea Constantinople blazed withilluminations and Germany broke forth into loud rejoicings So endedthe illstarred adventure For more than nine months we had fought notonly the Turks and the Germans in their strongholds but disease andthirst the droughts of summer and the blizzards of winter We had beenfoiled and the British Empire was the poorer by the loss of tens ofthousands of bright and gallant lives yet there was no murmuring Thenation set its teeth and turned to the next task It recognized thatthere must be failures in every great war and that one setback doesnot spell defeat                           The

every moment he was in the direst perilWhen his detachment was relieved he volunteered to stay on and directoperations Three times during the night of 8th9th August he was againheavily attacked and once the Turks got over his barricade but aftershooting three of them with his revolver he led his men forward anddrove the enemy out When at last he rejoined his battalion he waschoked and sickened by bomb fumes badly bruised by fragments ofshrapnel and could scarcely lift his arm which was stiff withcontinuous bombthrowing Thanks to his inspiring example and splendidtenacity an important

ona spring morning with the sun brightly shining and a blue sky overheadyet within a single hour all may be terribly changed The wind suddenlybegins to roar and in a few minutes a storm bursts in awful fury Wholeforests are laid low houses villages and towns are swept into ruinmen women and children lie dead beneath the stone and timber thatsheltered them the pride and labour of years are destroyed in a momentand terror and desolation stalk the land The terrible blast sweeps onbut gradually abates its ruthless might and by nightfall all is calmagain The stars gleam brightly from the stormswept sky and the moonshines with a message of cheer to the survivors who with the morninglight begin to repair the ravages which they have suffered and to goabout their business once more inspired by that hope which springseternal in the human breast[Illustration The Tornado of Fire which beat down upon the RussianTrenches on May 1 1915By permission of The Illustrated London News]Somewhat thus may we picture the Eastern arena of battle during the year1915 A mighty tornado suddenly burst upon the Russian armies and thewhole aspect of the war was changed The smiling sky of early April wasa fierce rack of roaring thunder clouds by the middle of May The onwardsweep of the whirlwind could not be resisted the Russians reeledbeneath the shock hundreds of thousands of their soldiers were sweptinto eternity and for months hopeless ruin stared the survivors in theface They recoiled before the terrible blast and fell back into thevastnesses of their land leaving behind them all the gains of ninemonths hard battling Whole provinces were yielded great cities fellinto the hands of their foes yet with sublime resolution they stillplodded eastwards until the fury of the storm began to abate By thistime they had knitted up their strength anew and were strong enough notmerely to resist the failing onset but to make headway against it Andso it came about that the dire gloom of early summer brightened into newhope by autumn and Russias foes though they had reft from herenormous tracts of territory knew in their hearts that they had failedThey had aimed at utterly destroying their enemy but they had donenothing of the kind and the new territory which they had won was likelyto become a Pandoras[53] chest of troubles By the end of the year theywere strung out on a line of nine hundred miles across the marshes andplains of Russia                           On page 125 of this volume I told you that with the fall of Przemysl on22nd March the Allies were full of hope that before the close of thesummer Cracow would fall Silesia would be entered the Russians wouldbe sweeping through Hungary and the end of the war would be in sightBut at the very moment when they were cherishing these rosy hopes therewas much weakness in the Russian armies They were holding far too longa line for the number of men and guns which they could put into thefield their forces were not joined up but were divided by gaps andthey had not sufficient railway lines to enable them to move troops andsupplies to any point which might be threatenedTheir greatest weakness however was their shortage of artillerymachine guns rifles and ammunition They had multitudes of men butthey could not arm them properly Large numbers of their recruits werewithout rifles and had to wait in the trenches often under heavy fireuntil they could take up the arms and ammunition of the wounded Thisgrave shortage of munitions was guessed at the time but the truth wasonly fully known in February 1916 when the Russian Minister of Warlifted the veil He told us that prior to the outbreak of hostilitiesthe Russians had relied on Germany for most of their war material andfor all the chemicals which enabled them to manufacture highexplosiveshells The consequence was that when the German supply was cut off theRussians had to build munition factories and make the necessarychemicals for themselves It is more than likely too that there wasserious wrongdoing in high quarters for in March 1916 the general whowas Minister of War in the early months of 1915 was brought to trialFor these reasons the Russians could not for a considerable timeproperly munition their armies and this led to the great misfortunewhich I am about to describeDespite their weaknesses the Russians were too near success for theGerman High Command to feel comfortable The Russian armies in Galiciawere only fifty miles from Cracow they had won fifty miles or more ofthe Carpathian watershed and in some places they commanded the southernends of the passes Unless they were checked and checked speedily theywould sweep down upon the great granary of Hungary and Germany wouldlose her greatest source of wheat supplies There was no time to belost A gigantic effort must begin immediately and the Russians must becleared out of Galicia altogetherPreparations were at once made with the utmost secrecy and dispatch andbefore the Russians had more than an inkling of what was on footGermany was ready to strike Never before in the history of the worldhave so many guns and men been so silently and swiftly brought up to anenemys front The secret was wonderfully kept Train after trainheavily laden with hundreds of big guns and threequarters of all theshells that had been made in the busy munition factories of Germanyduring the winter was hurried to Galicia and soon the new depotserected near the Donajetz were full to overflowing Then followed manypontoons and much bridging material for many rivers would have to becrossed on the line of the proposed advance New hospital stations wereestablished a network of telegraph lines was erected and great herdsof cattle for feeding the armies were penned behind the German linesThen with the same speed and secrecy masses of troops were hurriedinto Galicia and before long there were two millions of men betweenBukovina and Cracow Not until everything was ready did Dmitrieffdiscover his dangerThe plan of campaign was as follows Von Mackensen was to be providedwith not less than 1500 guns and ten army corps and with these he wasto batter his way through the Russian lines He meant to overwhelm theRussian trenches by means of a hurricane of artillery fire and thenthrust forward his men in close order wave after wave and drive thebroken and dazed enemy before him He was going to do what we had doneat Neuve Chapelle but he had far better prospects of success for theRussians had neglected to prepare second and third lines of defence andthey were woefully deficient in artillery rifles and ammunition Oncehe could get the Russians on the run he might envelop and utterlydestroy them At any rate he would hurl them back to the river San[Illustration The Russian Retreat from the Donajetz to the San]This map shows you the Russian line on 28th April By this timeDmitrieff was aware that a mighty force of Germans was in front of himHe sent an urgent message to Ivanov begging for two corps asreinforcements but by some mistake the message never reachedheadquarters and he was forced to meet the terrible thrust of the enemywith only his winter strengthVon Mackensen began the action by an advance on Gorlice and Dmitrieffwas forced to weaken his centre in order to strengthen his left wingMeanwhile the real attack was beginning farther north Midway betweenGorlice and Tarnow you will see a break on the Russian front It wasagainst this point that von Mackensen made his great effort On themorning of 1st May hundreds of his big guns began to roar and soonshells were falling fast and thick on the Russian trenches It is saidthat no less than 700000 shells were hurled against the Russianpositions on that day Nothing could live in the whirlwind of death andspeedily the Russian trenches were wiped out and thousands of Russianswith themMeanwhile pontoons were pushed across the river and as soon as thebombardment ceased wave after wave of Germans in close order surgedforward By the next day they had broken through the Russian line andthe whole of the front was turned There was nothing for it but swiftretreat Nor were the Russians able to make a stand until they weretwenty miles from the position which they had occupied all winterOn the little river Wisloka they halted and turned their faces to thefoe The line of the river gave them but a poor defence but it wasnecessary that they should hold back the enemy if Brussilovs armywhich lay along the foothills of the Carpathians was to escape By thistime the famous Caucasian corps had been hurried up to stem the Germantorrent These devoted men though they had no heavy guns defied theterrible artillery fire of the enemy and at length managed to get togrips with him They fought with supreme valour they captured one ofthe German batteries took 7000 prisoners and slew many thousandsmore Not until they had lost 10000 men did they perceive that no humanvalour could avail against Mackensens merciless guns For fivepriceless days they held out and then were forced to retreat towardsthe little river WistokSoon the retreat became something like a rout and Brussilovs army wasin deadly peril For a moment it looked as if von Mackensen was about toroll up the two halves of Dmitrieffs army and achieve another SedanBut the Russians managed to push out strong forces towards Sanok andcheck the advancing enemy The five days stand on the Wisloka and thisnew movement enabled Brussilov after much desperate fighting towithdraw his troops from the foothills and to retreat eastwards Manyof his men who were south of the Dukla and Lupkow Passes were cut offand made prisonersThis check enabled the Russian armies to withdraw towards the San andtake up the position shown upon the map page 293 There was now nofear of a rout and they reached the new position in perfect order Sofar all von Mackensens efforts to roll them up had failed He had wona great victory it is true in a fortnight he had pushed back Dmitrieffsome eightyfive miles and had taken large numbers of prisoners andmuch war material He had loosed upon the Russians such a storm of fireas had never been known before in the history of the world and blastedand scorched they had fallen back hurriedly with overwhelming numbershard on their heels They had suffered awful losses but they had notbeen destroyed Most armies under such terrible punishment would havebroken into flying fragments but the Russians showed all the dournessand fortitude of their race and managed to hold together Theirrearguards freely sacrificed themselves that the army might make goodits escape It was unbroken and undefeated at the Wistok and the latterpart of its retreat to the San was slow and orderly The German victorywas thus matched by an equally great Russian achievement On 12th Maythe Russian army after passing through an agony that seemed to promiseits total destruction lay along the San with its face still to the foeWhile the Russians were retreating from the Wistok to the San the GrandDuke Nicholas and his staff looked the facts fairly in the face Theyknew that they were hopelessly outclassed by the Germans both in gunsand in number of men and it was idle to suppose that they could resistvon Mackensens terrible thunderstorm of shell until they were equallywell supplied If they gave battle to the foe they would be utterlywiped out As a Russian soldier put it We have only one weapon theliving breast of the soldier The Grand Duke finally decided toretreat not for leagues but for hundreds of miles He would draw theGermans on and on until he led them into the very heart of Russia ifneed be As the Germans followed him eastwards they would leave therailways behind them and be forced to move their monster guns and heavyloads of shell over country without railways and without good roadsThousands of square miles of territory would have to be given up to theinvader but as he pushed eastward his strength would grow less andless and the time would be gained for Russia to supply herself with theguns and munitions which she so sorely lacked Then at last her hourwould strike She would be able to turn and rend the weakened foe[Illustration A Night Scene before the City of Warsaw An Engagement inFront of the doomed CapitalFrom the picture by Frdric de Haenen By permission

up into the heavens and bursts into ashower of silver stars As they fall slowly the country beneath islighted in high relief A long arm of searchlight shoots across theheavens A line of sparks reveals a battalion of the advancing enemy]Such was the Grand Dukes plan He knew full well all that it involvedPrzemysl and Lemberg at whose capture joy bells had rung throughoutall Russia would have to be left behind The great city of Warsawwhich had thrice defied von Hindenburg must be abandoned The line ofthe Vistula must be allowed to fall into German hands and probably theGerman flag would wave above the great Polish fortresses but if thearmies could be saved all might yet be wellIn our first volume page 64 I told you how Napoleon the greatest warlord that Europe has ever known marched a great army into Russia in theyear 1812 and by so doing rang his death knell The Russians were nowabout to repeat the tactics of 1812 and observers in the Westprophesied that the Kaiser would be led into the same trap and sufferthe same fate But we must remember that the conditions had changed inmany respects since Napoleons day He failed chiefly because he couldnot obtain sufficient supplies The country through which he advancedhad been swept clear of everything but wood and water and all the foodand munitions that his armies needed had to be sent forward byhorsedrawn wagons along tracks which frequently ended in morasses Whenthese wagons failed to reach the troops the men starved Nowadays everyarmy is accompanied by engineers who can build roads and light railwaysvery quickly and so keep the advancing army in touch with its basesFor example during the campaign which I am about to describe a Germangeneral boasted that his men who then lay within a hundred miles ofRiga were eating bread baked in Berlin the day before He also saidthat his engineers could construct fifty miles of asphalted road in twodays Motor transport has largely superseded the horse and longdistances given fair roads can be covered very quickly Thus you seethat in our time Napoleons great difficulty need not be fatalThere was however much danger in pushing far into the bowels of theland As the German lines of communication grew longer and longersupplies would take more and more time to reach the armies and therewould be more and more chances that the line might be impeded or cutThousands of men would have to be taken from the firingline to hold therailways and roads along which the convoys travelled and thus theattack would gradually lose force and at last be unable to resist avigorous onset by the enemy                           Now we must return to the San where the Russian armies were lying readyto retreat when the word was given From the map on page 293 you noticethat the Russian lines bulged out in front of Przemysl Ivanov wasprepared to give up this fortress but not until he had cleared it ofeverything that might be useful to the enemy In order to gain time hefought a holding battle in the centre and struck hard on the flanks Onthe morning of 15th May his right began a three days battle in whichthe Austrians were well beaten and after losing 30000 men had to fallback The enemy was caught in the open and the Russians plied thebayonet with deadly effect On the borders of Bukovina the Russian leftalso had a success and the enemy was driven back as much as thirtymiles But in the centre where Mackensen was advancing a verydifferent state of things prevailed The salient round Przemysl wasfiercely attacked in three places and its sides were driven in untilthe neck was less than ten miles across Attacks were also made at twoplaces farther north When the Russian line was pierced at these pointsthe AustroGermans were able to swing southwards towards the mainrailway and the days of Przemysl were numberedOn 31st May the fortress fell and at 330 on the morning of 2nd Junevon Mackensen entered the city The Russians had held it a little overtwo months The capture of Przemysl was a great feather in vonMackensens cap but it was no great prize He found it little more thanan empty shell Guns rolling stock and supplies had been movedeastwards and only a little booty fell into his handsWhy you ask did not von Mackensen push on more quickly and keep theRussians on the run You must remember that his great weapon consistedof an enormous number of heavy guns which could only be moved slowly Assoon as the great machine lumbered up the Russians were bound toretreat but while it was slowly advancing to a new position they wereable to hold back the enemy on the wings and send away eastward all thevaluable contents of the city The great danger was always in thecentre where von Mackensen was making his terrible thrust on the wingsthe Russians were able to delay the enemyThe fall of Przemysl compelled the Russians to give ground once moreand on 14th June their line ran as shown in the map on page 293 Whilethe retreat was proceeding Brussilov scored a victory When the Germanright wing had pushed through the forests from Stryj had crossed theDniester and was travelling by bad country roads Brussilov caught itat a disadvantage A three days battle followed in which the enemy wasflung back across the Dniester with heavy loss Some 17 guns 49 machineguns and more than 15000 prisoners were captured including a wholecompany of the Prussian Guard Successes on the wings however couldavail nothing while von Mackensen was blasting his way through thecentreA glance at the map shows you what a very strong position the Russiansheld from Grodek southward In front of the city for fifteen miles thereis a series of shallow swampy lakes with but few roads crossing thedry ground between them Farther south lies a great district of marshesThe Russian lines behind the lakes and the marshes could not be forcedbut they would be turned if the Germans could break through to the northof Grodek and force the line of the Dniester to the south of the cityVon Mackensen now moved on a broad front towards Rava Russka and assoon as his great guns began their terrific onslaught on the Russianlines the fate of Lemberg was no longer in doubt On 19th June he brokethrough and on the same day the German right wing crossed the DniesterNext day a fierce battle was fought for Rava Russka Von Mackensen wonit and then swung his forces southwards in the direction of LembergThe Grodek position had been turned and once more the Russians wereforced to retreat The way to Lemberg was open and on 22nd June theAustrians entered the city After nine months the capital of Galiciapassed once more into their hands Vienna Buda Pest and scores ofother places in AustriaHungary broke into loud rejoicing Towns andvillages were bedecked with flags and joyous peals rang out from everybelfryThere was good reason why the Austrians should rejoice at the recoveryof Lemberg They had not only regained the capital of Galicia but theywere once more masters of a city that afforded them a splendidjumpingoff place for carrying the war into Russia As you see by themap Lemberg is almost on the Russian frontier and six lines ofrailway meet in it So long as the Austrians could hold on to LembergGalicia was safe Its recapture was therefore a triumph for vonMackensen but though he had reconquered a province and its capital hehad not brought the war any nearer to its end He had neither shatteredthe Russian armies nor split them in twain                           It is said that one day in June just before the fall of Lemberg theKaiser met von Hindenburg and his Chief of Staff von Falkenhayn in thecastle at Posen The Kaiser was in high spirits and he declared thatthe moment had now arrived for the capture of Warsaw He already sawhimself riding into the city at the head of his troops as the conquerorand deliverer of Poland The two generals gladly agreed with hisproposal They believed that the Western front could be held withoutmuch effort and that with the mighty engine of artillery which they nowpossessed they could batter through the Russian lines and seize thegreat city which had so long defied themAfter the fall of Lemberg Warsaw formed the apex of a great salient Itcould only hold out so long as the two great railway lines which meet inthe city were in the hands of the Russians The first of these routesruns northeast through Grodno Vilna and Dvinsk to Petrograd Theother line runs southeast through Ivangorod Lublin Cholm and Rovnoto Kiev[54] Von Mackensen was already pushing northwards towards thissouthern line of railway and the Russians were falling back before himIt was now the business of von Hindenburg to advance from East Prussiaand capture the northern line Once the railways were cut Warsaw wouldfall Von Falkenhayn however hoped to do more than merely capture thecity and a few more thousand square miles of Polish ground He hoped tomake an end of the Russian armies in the salient and this he proposedto do by carrying out a great enveloping movement While von Mackensenwas pushing on towards the southern railway he would make a fiercethrust at the northern part of the same salient in order to cut thePetrograd line between Warsaw and Bialystok But this was not the wholeof the plan A German army under von Buelow had already overrunCourland[55] and was not far from Riga While the two thrusts werebeing made at the salient this force was to hack its way south seizeKovno and Vilna and cut the Petrograd line far to the eastward TheRussians in the salient would thus be taken in flank and in rear theywould be squeezed between the enemy on the north and the south andprobably would be surrounded and forced to surrender Russia would thusbe crippled for many a month to come and then the might of Germanycould be flung against the Western frontWe will now follow the fortunes of the three great thrusts that wereabout to be madethe thrust against the southern railway the thrustagainst the Petrograd railway between Warsaw and Grodno and the thrustagainst the same railway still farther east Before the end of June fiveGerman armies with von Mackensen in the centre were moving steadilynorthwards to cut the southern railway line between Lublin and KovelThey had now left the railways of Galicia behind them and were crossinga country of forests marshy plains and bad roads The great guns movedslowly but the armies met with little opposition and by 2nd July theywere less than thirty miles from the railwayRound about Krasnik they came into touch with the Russians who held astrong position with marshes and streams on their flanks The army ofthe Archduke Joseph to the left of von Mackensen was heavily assailedand during four days of attack and counterattack was driven back withthe loss of 15000 prisoners a very large number of machine guns andheavy casualties in dead and wounded For a week the German advance waschecked It began again on 16th July when von Mackensen who hadbridged the marshy streams was able to get his big guns working Oncemore he blasted his way through and on the 18th was within ten miles ofthe railwayNow let us see what was going on in the north On 14th July vonBuelows army in Courland began to push forward and at the same timeanother army attacked the Niemen front The great thrust against theWarsaw salient was entrusted to von Gallwitz who now advanced againstthe line of the Narev He made good progress and the Russians fellback fighting stubbornly They retired across the Narev on the 20thand three days later von Gallwitz won several crossings of the river Bymeans of one of these crossings he pushed forward until by 25th Julythough the river line had not yet been won on a broad front he laywithin twenty miles of the WarsawPetrograd railway Meanwhile theGerman heavy guns were battering down the outworks of the riverfortresses and the army of the Niemen was within sixty miles of VilnaThe Warsaw salient was now in great peril Spears had been plantedagainst its breast in three different directions At the apex aspearhead was but fifteen miles away another was only ten miles fromthe southern railway and a third was but twenty miles from the northernrailway The fortified line of the Narev had been broken through andthe salient was doomed Once more the Grand Duke had to make a decisionupon which hung the fate of the Russian armies Should he try by meansof the great Polish triangle of fortressesNovo Georgievsk IvangorodBrest Litovskito hold the salient or should he sacrifice Poland andfall back to the east The second course was by far the more difficultTo withdraw his armies along the three railways left to him while thespearheads were closing in hour by hour and any day two of the threeroads of escape might be lost was a most perilous task His wornouttroops would have to hold the sides of the salient for some weeks whilethe main body retired If the sides were forced in it was more thanlikely that his armies would be utterly overwhelmed It seemed easier tohold on to the fortresses and hope that in some way or other the enemymight be checkedThe Grand Duke refused to take any risks he chose the more difficulttask He determined to withdraw his armies from Poland altogether andfall back eastward and ever eastward until his forces could be properlyfed with munitions and were ready to make a stand It was a greatresolve and few commanders would have dared to make it Probably noother army could have made such a retirement without losing heartaltogether and hopelessly breaking down                           The last days of July saw strange scenes in Warsaw The whole city wasstripped of everything that might be useful to the enemy The greatfactories were dismantled and their plant sent eastward Gold from thebanks books and papers from the Government offices relics and sacredpictures from the churches bells from the towers copper from theroofs wire from the telegraph polesall were piled on great wagonswhich followed each other in a long procession across the Vistulabridges Half a million of the citys inhabitants streamed eastwards incarts and in hackney carriages Only the Poles and the poorest of theJews remainedAbout 24th July the forces in front of Warsaw began to fall back intothe suburbs of the city Meanwhile along the Narev a fierce holdingbattle was being fought to enable the troops in the northern part of thesalient to get away Five days later Mackensen cut the southern linebetween Lublin and Cholm and the sides of the triangle were fastclosing in By this time all the stores and guns were safe and thetroops in the centre were moving through the city Every day Germanaeroplanes dropped bombs in the streets and soon as the German shellsburst among the houses great fires began to flame up in the westernsuburbs At three oclock on the morning of Thursday 5th August threeloud explosions shook the city The Vistula bridges had been blown upThree hours later German cavalry galloped in and that evening PrinceLeopold of Bavaria with his suite rode through the streets on the way tothe palace On the eastern horizon he saw the red glow which Napoleonhad seenthe flames rising from crops and villages which the Russianshad fired as they fell back before the invaderThe Kaiser made no state entry into Warsaw His exultation howeverappeared in the following telegram which he sent to his sister theQueen of Greece My destructive sword has crushed the Russians Theywill need six months to recover In a short time I will announce newvictories won by my brave soldiers who have shown themselves invinciblein battle against nearly the whole world The war drama is now coming toa close[Footnote 53 Pandra In ancient Greek story a goddess whopossessed a box

German bombardment which drove theRussians out of their positions on the Donajetz Von Mackensen as youknow had 1500 guns and many of them were monster howitzers It issaid that a thousand wagonloads of shell were used in a singledaythat is twice as many as would have sufficed under ordinaryconditions for the six months siege of a great and wellprovisionedfortress Ten shells each weighing 800 lbs were hurled on every yardof the Russian front An officer calculated that the part of the linewhich he was holding received no less than 10000 shells in the courseof a few hours The wreckage was awful and those who survived weredazed and stupefied and unable to resist[Illustration Where the Cossacks score a Cavalry Skirmish in the Rearof the Russian RetreatBy permission of The Graphic]Another correspondent describes what he saw in Warsaw prior to the entryof the Germans Day and night he tells us one heard the muffled roaras factory plant too heavy or too deeply embedded in concrete to bemoved was blown up Every fragment of the metal was carried eastwardsThe newspapers made their last appearance with a notice that the citywas to be abandoned after which the linotypes were uprooted and thevery floors carted away Police and soldiers visited every printingworks and newspaper office taking away founts of type and dismantlingpresses Hardly a ton of copper fittings was left in the city   Warsaw knew no sleep over that week end Through the streets passedendless columns of carts and lorries heavily laden and all making forthe bridges across the Vistula You could only distinguish a wagonloaded with millions of roubles in paper money from those containingsacks of potatoes by the soldiers who sat swinging their legs over theside Day and night gangs of soldiers were seen stripping league afterleague of copper telegraph wires from their poles Church doors flungopen revealed the interiors filled with weeping praying Poles andRussians amongst whom passed priests in their rich vestments Aloft inthe towers the huge bronze bells had been unslung lest they shouldbecome food for Krupps furnaces Not only the bells but all recordsand church plate precious vestments and ikons[56] were carted awayinto the interior In the Church of the Holy Cross there was a vaultand in it lay the heart of Chopin[57] The vault was opened and theprecious relic was removed to Moscow Wherever possible troops were sentout to garner the crops in the surrounding country Where this wasimpossible the harvest was destroyed and villages were burnt to theground Thousands of poor were ferried across the Vistula to begin theirlong tramp eastward                           It is said that after the fall of Warsaw the Kaiser was very muchannoyed that the Russian army had been allowed to escape We have paidtoo dearly he said to his generals for the privilege of walkingalong the streets of Warsaw Our success has been gained under such acloud of mourning that at present I cannot think of rewards You are notlittle children to be dazzled with a toy while the Russian troops are atliberty You have secured the cage but the bird has flown While theRussian army is free the problem of the war is unsolvedA Russian journalist tells us that when the Kaiser seized the cagewithout the bird he began like Jehu to drive furiously in the hope ofrounding up the retreating enemy His soldiers were drivenremorselessly The advance guard was ordered not to beat the enemy butto detain him until the arrival of the main body The leadingdetachments were hurried along so rapidly that they often lost touchwith each other Along the Vistula on the bridges and at the fordssentinels remained unchanged and without food for two or three days at astretch They were forgotten and some of them died at their posts Allthis time the Russians made great captures of their pursuers So manyGermans were seized that the captors scarcely knew how to deal withthem The prisoners when questioned said that they had been marchingalmost without pause for five days and nights Each morning they weredriven forward for three or four hours Then they had twenty minutesrest and were again sent onward until midnight                           Perhaps you will be surprised to learn that a British boy fought withthe Russians and that he rose from the ranks to be an ensign[58] Hisname was John Wilton and he was a frail lad of seventeen when the Tsargave him permission to serve in the ranks of the famous PetrogradGuards He became a mounted scout and took part in every battle inwhich his corps was engaged He was one of the scouts who managed to getwithin eight miles of Cracow After six months service he was promotedensign and five months later was in command of the mounted scouts ofhis regiment On one occasion he very cleverly withdrew his scouts froma position in which they had been ambushed by German cavalry and gotthem away with the loss of only one man                           You have read more than once in these pages of women fighting in theRussian ranks A story from Petrograd tells us that twelve schoolgirlsfrom a Moscow college somehow obtained uniforms boarded a militarytrain at a roadside station and thus reached the Austrian frontierWhen they left the train for the march towards Lemberg the majordiscovered them and ordered them back home but they persuaded him tolet them go on with the army We had to have our hair cropped saidone of them Zoe Smirnoya a girl of sixteen That is what I felt mostMy hair was long and I confess I cried Ive carried it ever since inmy haversackThe girls fought in many of the Galician battles They never fell out ofthe ranks and they shared all the hardships of the campaign They tookmens names and their comrades treated them kindly When vonMackensens big guns swept away the Russian trenches they fell back withthe army An officer asked Zoe Were you afraid Of course shereplied how could one help When the big shells burst all around us wecould not help crying out Several of the girls were only fourteen andin their terror they called for their mothers For that matter I thinkI blubbered tooDuring the retreat one of the girls was killed by a shell We buriedher on the morning after the battle said Zoe We put her in ahurriedlymade grave and set up a little cross marked with her name Onthe morrow we were far away and now I hardly remember the place whereshe was buried Zoe was twice hit and the second time was left out inthe open but was rescued by stretcherbearers She spent a month inhospital and returned to the firing line as a corporal wearing the warmedal and the Cross of St George                           Amongst the names that Russians hold in high honour is that ofMichaelovna Ivanova who acted as a nurse under her brother aregimental surgeon She insisted on going out to tend wounded even inthe midst of a hail of bullets from rifles and machine guns Her brotherand the other regimental officers begged her to seek shelter but invain When all the officers had fallen the men lost heart for a momentand began to retire At once the heroic nurse ran in amongst themrallied them round her and at their head rushed forward and captured atrench Unhappily she was struck by a bullet and died shortlyafterwards                           Perhaps you will be surprised to learn that British seamen witharmoured motor cars were sent out to lend a hand to the Russians Theydid not take part in the fighting described in the former chapter forthey only left England late in the year On 12th December when theywere in the Arctic Ocean on the way to Archangel they established arecord by singing God save the King farther north than any Britishfield force on active service had ever been before We may be quite surethat under Commander LockerLampson they fully upheld the honour andglory of the British Navy It is also said that Japanese guns andgunners fought for Russia during the year 1915[Footnote 56 Sacred pictures found in all Russian churches and houses][Footnote 57 Shpan Frdric Franois Chopin 180949 greatPolish musical composer and the finest pianist of his time No man hasever excelled him in writing music for the piano][Footnote 58 Equivalent to our second lieutenant]  CHAPTER XL  FROM STORM TO CALMWhen the Germans entered Warsaw the German High Command had to decidewhat the next move was to be Should they entrench on the ground alreadywon and make the line of the Niemen the Narev and the Vistula a greatbulwark of defence which would defy all Russian counterattacks for manya day to come or should they push their armies forward There were goodreasons why a halt should be called on the river line The troops wereweary with long months of fighting and badly needed rest On the otherhand the Russian armies were not crushed but it seemed likely thatanother big push would destroy them altogether With Warsaw gone thesouthern railway cut and the Narev line crumbling it appeared almostimpossible for the Russians to escape The army in Courland was almostwithin striking distance of the Petrograd railway and once this wascaptured in the neighbourhood of Dvinsk and Vilna the whole Russianfront would be split up into separate armies each of which might bedestroyed Another great effort and the Tsar would be on his kneessuing for peaceThe die was now cast the Germans decided to push forward The Russianswere in perilous plight for on the right the Germans bade fair toenvelop their armies and in the centre von Mackensen was thrusting themback towards the Marshes of the Pripet in which they might be caughtThe Grand Dukes business was to get his armies away eastward and torefuse at all costs to fight pitched battles In this he succeeded andby doing so wrote his name high on the roll of great generalsYou will remember that the bridges across the Vistula at Warsaw had beenblown up Prince Leopold now collected a number of the thousandtonbarges which ply on the river and constructed a floating bridge acrosswhich he carried a railway line By 10th August he began to advance buthe found himself constantly held up by Russian attacks and he made butslow progress By 16th August von Gallwitz was across the Petrogradline and von Mackensen was within twenty miles of Brest Litovski TheRussians had already fallen back and were lying in front of the railwayfrom Ossowietz through Bialystok to Brest They were however stillholding out in front of the old city and fortress of KovnoGlance at the position of Kovno You see page 311 that it stands onthe Niemen at the point where the course of the river swings to thesouth Should Kovno fall the other fortresses on the Niemen would be ingreat peril and the enemy would have a direct route to Vilna wherethey would be in the rear of the Russians On the day that Warsaw fellthe Germans were near enough to Kovno to begin the bombardment Fortwelve days they rained shells upon the forts while the infantry foughtfor the outworks By this time the city had been stripped and itsvaluable contents had been sent eastwards Nevertheless it had to beheld while arrangements were made for the Russian line to retire Thegunners in Kovno stuck to their posts for twelve desperate days and allthe time the big siege howitzers of the enemy played havoc among themNevertheless the Russians held on and what is more continued to worktheir gunsBy Sunday 15th August the forts were in ruins and two days later theheroic garrison yielded The Germans claimed 20000 prisoners and over200 guns The Russians however were fully prepared for this loss Theholding of Kovno was a forlorn hope and the men and guns in it weresacrificed to gain timeThe fall of Kovno meant that the Russian right must now retire and aday later it was clear that the centre must retire too The Germans hadcut the railway to the north of Brest and were now attacking thewestern forts of the stronghold Next day Novo Georgievsk which hadbeen besieged for about three weeks and was now a huddle of ruins hadto yield and 20000 of the garrison along with 700 guns most of whichhad been rendered useless fell into the hands of the Germans Shortlybefore the surrender a daring Russian aviator was entrusted with themaps and secret papers of the fortress He ascended and thoughfuriously assailed by the antiaircraft guns of the enemy managed tofly clear and carry the precious documents into safetyTwo of the three great fortresses forming the Polish triangle had nowgone Brest alone remained and its doom was already sealed While theRussians were preparing for a further retirement their right whichrested on the Baltic Sea was threatened with a new danger On Sunday10th August a German fleet tried to force a way into the Gulf of Rigait was beaten off but the attempt was renewed on the 15th and on the16th During a thick fog the Germans got into the Gulf on the 16th andtwo days later tried to land troops at an unfortified port on the roadto Petrograd Four very large flatbottomed barges filled with troopsattempted to get ashore on the 20th but the Russian light craft swoopeddown upon them and captured or destroyed the whole of the landingforce Meanwhile a naval battle was going on throughout the length ofthe Gulf The Russians lost an old gunboat while the Germans had eightdestroyers and two cruisers either sunk or put out of action and asubmarine driven ashore On the 21st the Germans left the Gulf Theirattempt to outflank the Russian right had failedDuring the previous twenty days the Germans in the centre had pushedforward no less than one hundred miles but the Russian armies hadeluded them and no crushing battle had taken place The Germans had notyet given up all hope of overwhelming the Russians but for the timebeing they were anxious to secure a strong line on which they mightmaintain themselves during the coming winter They had also a newcampaign in view Already they were thinking of forcing a way throughthe Balkans to Constantinople so as to open a road to the east andfling such forces into Gallipoli as would drive the British and Frenchinto the seaNow we must return to the doomed fortress of Brest On the day that theGerman warships left the Gulf of Riga Prince Leopold was close to thewestern walls of the fortress while von Mackensen east of the Bug wasthreatening to take the forts from the rear On 25th August BrestLitovski fell It had held out long enough to enable the Russians to getaway with the guns and supplies and only a little wheat was leftbehind Soon after the Germans entered the place a mine exploded anddestroyed a thousand of their troops[Illustration Map illustrating the various Stages of the RussianRetreatA after the fall of Lemberg B after the fall of Warsaw C after thefall of Grodno D after the fall of Vilna]You will see from the map on page 311 that the Russians who had beenholding the front around Brest could use two railways to help them intheir retreat Most of them however had to retire on foot through theMarshes of the Pripet Prince Leopold in following them up had tofight his way through the great forest region which lies to the north ofBrest It is said that in the recesses of this forest the Europeanbison elsewhere extinct is still found In the woods on the edges ofthe marshes the Russian rearguards fought fierce delaying actions whiletheir comrades trudged unhasting but unresting eastwards Happily thesummer had been fairly dry and it was possible for large numbers of menand guns to cross the swamps By the end of August the Germans werethirty miles east of Brest and were well within the marshy regionMeanwhile the chief interest of the struggle lay in the north On 28thAugust von Buelow began his great attack on the line of the Dvina Inall the valley of that river from Dvinsk to Riga there is no crossingsave at the little town of Friedrichstadt some fifty miles from thecoast Below the town great stretches of marshy forest line the leftbank of the stream and no road follows its course on that side On theother side the ground is harder and along the line of the river runsthe main RigaVilna Railway The Russians held the left bank of theriver and von Buelow urged his men to the assault in the followingwords After the brilliant campaign on the Russian front and theoccupation of many cities and fortresses you must make one more effortto force the Dvina and seize Riga There you will rest during the autumnand winter in order to march on Petrograd in the spring On themorning of 2nd September the Russians were forced back for ten milesfrom the left bank of the river but the bridgehead at Friedrichstadtstill held out                           With the close of August the worst was over and the turn of the tidehad come The tornado had blown itself out the skies were clearing andthose who had been hurled back by the mighty blast were able to keeptheir feet and hold their own once more The Russian line was nearlystraight the wings were hard pressed but they could still resist andthe centre was too far within the Pripet marshes for easy capture Thestruggle for dear life was over Thenceforward the Russians were mastersof their fate They could retreat when and where they chose into thelimitless expanses of their land If they halted to fight a battle itwas because they saw some advantage to be gained not because they werecompelled to do so[Illustration The Tsar and Tsarevitch with the Russian ArmyBy permission of The SphereThe Tsarevitch the eldest son of the Tsar is the Grand Duke Alexiswho was born on August 12 1904 He was therefore eleven years old whenon September 5 1915 his father took command of the Russian armiesBoth father and son are seen wearing the uniform of the CaucasianCossacks]With the passing of all immediate danger confidence surged up in theirbreasts and at this moment the Tsar placed himself at the head of hissoldiers We shall he said fulfil our sacred duty to defend ourcountry to the last The Grand Duke Nicholas who had so long borne theheat and burden of the day gladly yielded place to his sovereign Twicebefore in the history of Russia had a Tsar come forward to lead hisarmies in the day of dire peril What Peter[59] and Alexander I[60] haddone Nicholas II now did It was a sign to the whole Russian peoplethat the war was to be waged to a triumphant end The Germans wereprepared to make a separate peace with Russia they believed her to becrushed and broken and warweary Now came the reply the Tsar the headand front of Russia both in Church and in State followed the example ofhis forefathers in the hour of trial and took chief command                           Look carefully at the large map on page 311 and find Grodno on theNiemen At the end of August the Russians were holding a salient roundthis fortress September was but three days old when Grodno fell andthe Russians had to retire in order to avoid being surrounded They hadtwo railways to help them in their retreatthe main line to Petrogradand a line connecting with the RigaVilnaRovno Railway At all coststhe enemy must be held back from these railways until the guns troopsand stores in and around Grodno could be got away Rearguards behindGrodno and a screen of troops farther north where the Germans had tocross a district of lakes and forests fought gallantly and by 12thSeptember the salient was clear The Germans claimed to have captured4000 prisoners but even if they did so the price was not too high topay for the safety of the army corps that escapedNow we must turn to Vilna against which von Hindenburg had prepared agreat thrust On 2nd September a ten days struggle began fifteen milesto the northwest of the city By sheer weight of artillery the trenchesof the Russians were carried and a gas attack gave the Germans animportant pass between a group of lakes which formed the main defence ofthe fortress on their left Other forces were pushing up from the southand retreat was again necessary By the 13th it was clear that Vilnamust fall The Germans had cut the Petrograd railway only twenty milesfrom the city[Illustration The Coming of the Big Guns that mean VictoryBy permission of The Illustrated London NewsRussian artillery being hauled through the snow to the battlefield bylong teams of horses By September 1915 the Russians had managed toprovide themselves with sufficient artillery and ammunition to meet theGermans on equal terms]The forces in front of Vilna had only one good railway line by whichthey could retire eastward and only one good roada causeway runningacross the marshes towards Minsk On 15th September it was discoveredthat some 40000 German cavalry with 140 guns were sweeping round soas to cut the railway and capture the causeway Here was a terribledanger If the cavalry could hold the railway and the causeway theRussians in the Vilna salient would be surrounded and nothing couldsave them Not an hour must be lost Vilna was abandoned on 18thSeptember and the troops were hurried eastwards by means of the roadand railway Rearguards on the right fought desperate holding battlesbut on the 20th the gap through which the Russians were retreating hadshrunk to little more than fifty miles The Minsk railway was in dangeronly the causeway densely packed with guns wagons convoysambulances and troops was clearSuddenly in this moment of peril the German thrust weakened While thecavalry were sweeping round to the rear the artillery and infantry tothe west of the fortress made no push Owing to the bad and crowdedroads they could only proceed very slowly and thus the Russians wereafforded what they most neededtime No longer were they without armsand ammunition The Russian factories had worked miracles and now theTsars armies were able to meet the enemy on equal terms On the eveningof 20th September when the retreating Russians were thirty miles eastof Vilna their right wing fell upon the German cavalry and drove themback with the bayonet For some days there was heavy fighting but bythe end of the month the Russian line was straight again Once more theGermans had been foiledMeanwhile the army of Brest which had never been in serious danger hadbeen pursued but the pursuers were now firmly held On the Dvina vonBuelow had made but little progress while in the south Ivanov had heldhis ground and had even won victories against the German right He hadoverthrown a force moving against Tarnopol and another which wasadvancing further south and had won one of the most successful of thesmaller battles Of course the Germans had made counterattacks uponhim but they had been unsuccessful and Ivanov had advanced in someplaces as much as twenty miles His captures at the end of the monthamounted to 80000 men and many gunsThus the end of September saw the Germans held in check They had wonVilna and Grodno but they had failed to cut off the troops in thesesalients and had not made good the line of the Dvina Winter was almostupon them yet they had not found a suitable position for winterquarters Meanwhile the Russians were growing in strength every day                           During the terrible months from May till September the nation hadsuffered greatly and misfortune had been heaped on misfortune Thespectacle of troops falling back day by day the endless stream ofwounded arriving at the bases the highroads thronged with homelesspeasants and the seeming hopeless struggle would have broken down thespirit of most nations and brought about revolution but in Russiathough there was some unrest there was no revolution Even the peasantswho had lost their all and had not where to lay their heads bore theirsufferings without complaint A correspondent who talked with some ofthem tells us they felt that they were playing their part in defeatingthe hated enemy as their fathers had done before them They hoped foran early winter in order that their enemy might perish of cold andstarvation and they thought nothing of the sufferings that the winterwould bring to them and their children I have heard them say again andagain We must win now regardless of the cost and the time it takesThe sacrifices we have suffered are too great for us to hesitate atanything short of victory                           When the German cavalry were flung back from the rear of Vilna theretreating Russians once more breathed freely The end of the summercampaign had come and still the Germans had delivered no smashing blowDuring the month of October von Hindenburg strove fiercely to carry theline of the Dvina in order to secure Dvinsk and Riga as winterquarters The Russian right lay on the sea and behind the riverstretched a wilderness of marsh and lake almost impassable for troopsand big guns Riga and the line of the river south of it were defendedby great stretches of bogland and the patches of dry ground were cut upby many sluggish streams flowing in reedy channels General Ruzsky whowas holding Dvinsk had learned the lesson of Verdun and pushed out hisdefences far from the city In the course of a big attack on 26thSeptember the Germans came within eight miles of the fortress but theycould approach no nearer An attempt to reach Riga by the coast road wasfoiled by the guns of the Russian fleetOn 3rd October von Hindenburg began a new series of thrusts against theline of the river but made very little progress and when the Russiancounterattacks began the German losses were very great Before long50000 of the enemy had fallen and their goal was as far off as everVon Hindenburg now saw that he could not succeed against Dvinsk andbegan a determined effort to capture Riga He managed to win a marshyisland in one of the arms of the river but here he was stayed and soonhis troops were blown off the island He was now fighting an army thatwas as strong as his own and could return shell for shell and shot forshot By the end of October all his efforts against Dvinsk and Riga hadcome to nothing and he was forced to dig in for the winter in a mostinhospitable land The snows were beginning to fall bitter north windswere sweeping over the land and no great movement was possible untilthe springSo the tragic year came to an end The Russians had passed through theirfiery ordeal and had emerged with a new courage and a new hope On themap the Germans looked like victors but actually they had failed TheRussian armies were intact the Germans could not push on in thewilderness and at the close of the year they lay waiting the uncertainfuture amidst dismal swamps and meres[Footnote 59 In 1707 when Charles XII of Sweden invaded Russia andbade fair to overrun the country Peter the Great put himself at thehead of his army and on July 5 1709 inflicted a great

welter of strife Italy declaredwar on Austria The story of why she did so and how she fared duringthe year 1915 will be told in our next volume We may safely postponean account of the Italian campaign for like our great adventure inGallipoli it was a sideshow Nevertheless it employed no less thantwelve Austrian army corps and thus largely reduced the forces whichthe enemy could employ in France and Flanders and the Eastern theatre ofwarItaly set herself the very difficult task of conquering theTrentino[62] and in order to do so had to force the barrier of theAlps For six months she fought with great firmness and much sacrificeamidst lofty snowclad mountains and battered unceasingly at the greatAustrian fortresses established amongst them By the end of the year hersoldiers had occupied a rich and wellpopulated portion of what theItalians call Unredeemed Italy had secured their northern flank andhad firmly established themselves along the line of the riverIsonzo[63] They had also captured 30000 of the enemy 5 guns 65 Maximguns thousands of rifles and a great deal of other war material andwere in a favourable position for an advance in the spring Should thisadvance be successful Austria would lose her two great seaports andexcept along the coast of Dalmatia[64] would be cut off from the sea                           July was but nine days old when good news arrived from South Africa TheUnion forces under General Botha[65] had conquered German SouthWestAfrica[66] and the colony had passed into British hands The story canwait until our next volume in which we shall survey the progress of ourarms not only in German SouthWest as South Africans call it but inthe Cameroons and in German East Africa as well From the first theGermans knew that their overseas possessions were doomed Powerless onthe ocean they were utterly cut off from their colonies Their overseasforces were fighting as it were in watertight compartments withouthope of reinforcements or supplies from the Fatherland                           We will now return to the Western front and learn something of whathappened in North France between the close of the Battle of Festubertand the great British attack of September At home people believed thata big push would be made in the West during the summer months but totheir astonishment the Allies did not attempt an offensive on a largescale The Russians as you know were then passing through a fieryordeal and their newspapers constantly asked why the Allies did notattack the enemy and draw off from Russia some of the fury of theGerman onset The fact was that the Allies were not in a condition toassault the German lines with any great hope of success Though they nowoutnumbered the Germans on the Western front they were still deficientin machine guns heavy artillery and stores of shell The battles ofFestubert and of the Artois had taught them that to hurl infantryagainst trenches which had not been previously wrecked by artillery firewas simply to send men to their death They had also learned thatpiercing the enemys line on a narrow front served no useful purposeDriving tiny wedges into the German position was not only costly but awaste of time A big rent must be made in order that cavalry might belaunched through the breach against the lines of communication Forsuch an operation they had not as yet sufficient artillery so theydecided  Tis better that the enemy seek us    So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers    Doing himself offence whilst we lying still    Are full of rest defence and nimbleness[67][Illustration]The war on the Western front during the months of June July and Augustwas little more than the old nibbling All along the line there weremany small attacks followed by small counterattacks and in some placesfierce little struggles for strongholds Trenches were lost and wonalmost daily but a weeks advance could be measured by yards In theseaffairs we gained little ground but we lost many men I cannot attemptto describe all the minor engagements of the summer months but I mustsay something about the fighting around Givenchy in the middle of JuneIn front of the 7th British Division there was an enemy stronghold knownto our troops as Stony Mountain and from it to another fortifiedpoint known as Dorchester ran two lines of German trenches The 7thDivision was ordered to make a frontal attack on Stony Mountain andthe 1st Canadian Ontario Battalion at the same time was to carry thetwo lines of trenchesAt three oclock on the afternoon of 15th June the Ontario regiment wasbrought up to the British trenches opposite to the position to beattacked and the men began to beguile the hours of waiting by singingpopular songs The attack was timed to commence at six in the eveningand at a quarter to six two 18pounder guns in the Canadian trenchesopened fire on the German position One of the guns swept away theGerman wire and knocked out two enemy Maxims but the other was wreckedby a shell Bullets from the German trenches rained down upon the gunstearing and twisting their shields as though they had been made ofpaper[Illustration The Canadians in a Hot CornerBy permission of The GraphicLieutenant Campbell hoisted his gun on to the broad back of hiscompanion Private Vincent and poured a stream of bullets upon theenemy]Just before six Canadian sappers exploded a mine on their front andseveral of their own bombers were killed or wounded by the force of theexplosion Immediately the leading company dashed forward through thesmoke and flying dirt and though met by a withering flank fire fromStony Mountain rushed the German front trench and gained possessionof Dorchester Those however who attacked on the Stony Mountainside were stopped by the fire of that fort and all were killed orwounded Bombing parties and sappers now went forward but almost all ofthem were shot down A sapper who reached the trench set out alone tobomb his way along it He did not retire until he had flung his lastbomb and then he had no less than ten wounds in his bodyThe second company closely followed on the heels of those who had wonDorchester and the two companies charged towards the Germansecondline trench which was carried Many of the Huns who put up afight were bayoneted and some prisoners were taken Meanwhile the thirdcompany after losing heavily in its advance was busy putting thecaptured firstline trench into a state of defence Two machine gunswere hurried forward but the entire crew of one of them was killed orwounded before the trench was reached The crew of the other gun nowreduced to two men Lieutenant Campbell and Private Vincent alumberjack from Bracebridge gained the position and LieutenantCampbell hoisted his gun on to the broad back of his companion andpoured a stream of bullets upon the enemy Later in the day when theCanadians were obliged to retire Lieutenant Campbell fell wounded butPrivate Vincent dragged the gun away into safety Lieutenant Campbellcrawled into the Canadian trench a dying man And no man died thatnight with more glory yet many died and there was much gloryThe supply of bombs ran short and Private Smith of SouthamptonOntario volunteered to go forward with a fresh supply Festooned withbombs he crawled forward on all fours and twice handed over his loadto his friends So hot was the fire that he had to toss the bombs[68]into the trench His clothes were shot to rags but he escapedunwounded But all Private Smiths efforts to supply the bombers wereunavailing Soon all the grenades were gone and meanwhile the machineguns and rifles on Stony Mountain were rapidly thinning the Canadianranks One unknown wounded man was seen standing on the parapet of theGerman frontline trench He had thrown every bomb he carried andweeping with rage continued to hurl bricks and stones at the advancingenemy till his end cameThe British division had been held up on the left and the enemy was nowgathering in strength The unsupported Canadians were therefore forcedto retire and give up the ground which they had gained During theretirement many men fell and some fine deeds of bravery were donePrivate Gledhill of Ben Miller near Goderich Ontario though hurledout of the trench by a bomb explosion which broke his rifle but did notinjure him found another rifle and continued to fire while hiscomrades retired and he was almost alone As he crawled towards his ownlines he fell over a wounded lieutenant and offered to carry him backThanks no said the lieutenant I can crawl Will you take measked a man with a leg missing who lay hard by Sure replied thegallant fellow and amidst a tempest of fire he dragged the wounded maninto safety Out of twentythree officers who went into battle that dayonly three were alive and untouched at nightfall The fort on StonyMountain could not be captured and all the valour and perseverance ofthe Canadians went for nothing                           The account which you have just read gives you a very fair idea of themidsummer fighting on the Western front Before I turn to the greatoffensive of September let me describe briefly the struggle which tookplace at Hooge towards the end of July and the beginning of August Ithad no real importance it was only an incident in the constant tug ofwar that went on along the opposing lines Hooge is a hamlet on theYpresMenin road about two miles east of the city On the 16th of Junewe had attacked the enemys line and had captured 1000 yards of Germanfront trenches a part of the line and 150 prisoners During thefighting the Liverpool Scottish did specially fine work[Illustration Plan of the Hooge AreaThe black line shows German position on morning of July 30 1915]This map shows you the scene of the struggle which I am about todescribe Notice the chateau and the lake to the north both were in thehands of the Germans who had pushed their front to the west andsouthwest of the lake and had thus made an ugly sag in our line Justnorth of the HoogeMenin road there is a big hollow marked Crater onthe map About 3 am on the morning of Friday 30th July the Germansviolently attacked our trenches to the east of the Crater They wereheld by men of the New Army The Germans had already sapped up close toour line and now they launched a torrent of liquid fire against us Atthe same time big guns on the high ground to the northeast andsouthwest bombarded our lines trench mortars joined in and bombersstormed our trenches with grenades This terrible onset of fire flameand bombs could not be resisted and the Germans carried the first lineand the Crater Our men fell back to the second line which rannorthwest from the corner of Zouave Wood Then the enemy began to shellthe second line and Zouave Wood became a deathtrap You will read on alater page how Second Lieutenant Sidney Woodroffe won the Victoria Crossby holding his trenches in Zouave Wood to the lastA counterattack was made in the afternoon but it failed Our men weremown down as soon as they advanced into the open The Rifle Brigade hadbeen entrusted with the task it pushed forward to certain death withwonderful steadiness but was almost wiped out During this unsuccessfulattack we lost 2000 men No further attempt was made for ten daysduring which time our gunners shelled the enemys lines and stopped thefire of their artillery So successful was the bombardment that it putnew heart into our men and they were quite ready for the next act ofthe drama which was timed for Monday 9th August Just before dawn onthat day the 16th and 18th Brigades advanced from the west and from thesouth against the Crater They had to push uphill in black darkness for500 yards The 2nd York and Lancaster issued from Zouave Wood with the2nd Durham Light Infantry on their right The two battalions made a raceof it and the Durhams won Over the horrible No Mans Land strewn withbarbedwire entanglements and the bodies of the unburied dead theinfantry swept on and in a few minutes were busy with the bayonet andbomb amongst the sorely shaken Germans Many of them were sheltering intheir dugouts which were very large and deep The two hundred who heldthe Crater were killed to a manA correspondent tells us that on scrambling over the enemys parapet asergeant lost his balance and fell on his back to the bottom of thetrench close to a mortar in charge of a sentry Immediately the sentryrushed at him with a bomb poised in his hand With a great effort thesergeant slewed round and dealt his opponent a kick in the ribs whichsent him spinning against the parapet where he was dealt with by aprivate who had followed hard on the heels of his sergeantWhen the trenches were cleared the infantry swept on to the chateau andcaptured the ruins of the stables where they dug in The attack hadbeen very successful and our losses were very few because of thesearching bombardment which had preceded the attack Correspondentsdescribe the high spirits of our men on that day It is said that manyof the less seriously wounded failed to report themselves because theydid not wish to miss the rest of the fightingAt halfpast nine that night German shells began to fall fast and thickon our new positions and our men dropped fast We lost some of ourtrenches north of Sanctuary Wood and had to retire to a little way infront of the Crater The enemy had made a curtain of fire behind ourlines and reliefs could only be brought up at great loss The battalionwhich had dug in near the stables was ordered to withdraw but fourofficers and 200 men did not receive the order and hung on untilrelieved late the next morning A small party of Durham Light Infantryunder Corporal Smith held out even longer and only retired when freshtroops took over their positionGradually the fighting died away We had recovered our former positionand what is more we had proved that given proper artillerypreparation the strongest German lines could be pierced The New Armywon its spurs at Hooge but at a very heavy cost[Illustration The Liverpool Scottish and other Regiments charging atHoogeBy permission of The Illustrated London NewsThis picture shows the British

south of Cuinchy for thepurpose of destroying an enemy machine gun that was annoying our men Hetook with him a supply of bombs and just before starting out on hisperilous mission asked his sergeant to open fire on the enemystrenches as soon as he had thrown his bombs This meant that he wasprepared to sacrifice himself for he was bound to be in the line offire from his own trench and could only escape death or wounding by amiracle He crept out into No Mans Land wormed his way through theGerman wire entanglements and reached the emplacement of the gunClimbing on to the top of the parapet he hurled a bomb on to the roofof the emplacement When the roar of the explosion subsided he heardthe noise of men running away About a quarter of an hour later he heardthe enemy returning At once he climbed up on the other side of theemplacement and with his left hand threw another bomb Then he layflat while the Germans fired round after round on the wire entanglementbehind him For more than an hour he lay unseen and unheard If thesergeant had opened fire as Mariner had wished nothing could have savedhim Fortunately his own people did not pull a trigger and he was ableto crawl back to his trench unharmed He had been out all alone for anhour and a halfLanceCorporal Leonard James Keyworth 24th Battalion London RegimentTFAt Givenchy on the night of May 2526 1915 the 24th Battalion made

He was half buried but after a night of horror managed toextricate himself from the heap of earth that covered him As hestruggled to get free his own men saw him through their periscopes andmade signs to him He called aloud to them for water and the Germanshearing him flung a bomb at him Happily it was unlighted Our men nowdetermined that their fallen officer should not be murdered The bestshots lined the parapet and neither side dared lift a head At last aGerman sniper shot the wounded officer in the side and he feigned deathso well that his men began to prepare a cross for his grave About

riddled with wounds Icould see the bombs coming he said later I actually watched the onethat cost me my left eye I thought both were blown out in that awfulburning flash so fearful was the pain in my face The sight of the twowounded men being mercilessly pelted by the enemy aroused the fiercestindignation in the British trench and only with the greatest difficultywere the men restrained from dashing out against the cowardly foe Ahurricane fire broke out on both sides and in the midst of it the twomen rolled into the Scottish trenchWhen the heroic collier lad was sufficiently recovered to

to and frosmiling and urging on his comrades with death nudging his elbow Howis it Mr Campbell this morning asked one of his men and his cheeryreply was Oh finewe are going to have a scrap today You willremember that at Givenchy on 15th June he took two machine guns overthe parapet and arrived at the German first line with one gun which hehoisted on the back of Private Vincent and continued to fire in spiteof the hail of bullets and bombs which fell around him When the supplyof bombs ran out Lieutenant Campbell advanced still further with hisgun and in an exposed position fired about one

alreadytold you that the German lines were by this time so studded withskilfully placed forts full of machine guns that no living infantrycould carry them until a road had been blasted through by artilleryfire You remember the maze of trenches and forts known to the French asthe Labyrinth The same sort of fortification extended along the wholeGerman line It was folly to break through the enemys line on a narrowfront for the troops which entered the gap were at once enfiladed andexposed to a murderous fire on their flanks This is precisely whathappened in the unsuccessful attack at Stony Mountain If the Germanfront was to be really broken a rent of at least fifteen miles must bemade in it In order to do this long preparation was necessaryThousands of guns and mountains of ammunition were required and aboveall the part of the line to be broken must be carefully selectedLook at the map on page 336 and note the position of that portion ofthe German line which extends between the Argonne on the east andAuberive on the west The cross railway line by means of which theGermans supplied their front in Champagne was in some places only fouror five miles from the French trenches and the main line was not morethan ten or twelve miles away If the French could break through in thisregion on a wide front they could send their cavalry forward to cut theGerman lines of communication in which case the enemy would be obligedto fall back and his retreat might easily become a rout The Frenchtherefore decided to make their big push in Champagne An advance onthis part of the line not only promised success but Champagne itselfwas very suitable for a great combined attack of infantry andartillery Unlike Artois and Flanders the country consists of rollingchalk downs with open bare and shallow valleys Guns could thus beused to the best advantage and infantry could push forward withoutbeing impeded by villages mounds of refuse railway embankments andsmall enclosed fields On the dull levels of Champagne the freedom ofFrance had thrice[69] been won Was history to repeat itself and was afourth deliverance to result from the great movement now about to bemadeA writer[70] thus describes the district    There is scarcely a region in all France where a battle could    have been fought with less injury to property Imagine if you    please an immense undulating plain its surface broken by    occasional low hills and ridges none of them much over six    hundred feet in height and wandering in and out between these    ridges the narrow stream which is the Marne The country    hereabouts is very sparsely settled the few villages that dot    the plain are wretchedly poor the trees on the slopes of the    ridges are stunted and scraggly the soil is a chalky marl    which you have only to scratch to leave a staring scar and the    grass which tries to grow upon it seems to wither and die of a    broken heart This was the great manoeuvre ground of Chlons    and it was good for little else yet only a few miles to the    westward begin the vineyards which are Frances chief source of    wealth and an hours journey to the eastward is the beautiful    Forest of the ArgonneThe French devoted most of the summer to preparations for the greatattack The British took over thirty additional miles of the line andthus released a large number of troops for the venture New units wereformed and the factories worked night and day to produce the immensequantity of ammunition which would be needed Artillery of every sizeand pattern from light mountain guns to monster howitzers weregradually brought together until nearly 3000 guns faced the GermansHad these guns been placed side by side they would have extended formore than fifteen miles Every battery knew exactly the portion of frontwhich it was to attack About twenty captive balloons fitted withtelephones and wires were provided for directing the fire of the gunsA network of light railways was built in order to bring up the vastsupplies of ammunition and from the railhead a highroad nine mileslong and forty feet wide was constructed across the plainDugouts for men stores for ammunition and underground firstaidstations were constructed and so that the infantry could reach theirpositions without being destroyed by German shell fire no less thanforty miles of reserve and communication trenches were made In someplaces saps and tunnels had been run out towards the German lines sothat the men making the first assault could spring suddenly from theearth The hospitals were emptied ready for the stream of wounded thatwould soon flow into them Officers and men were diligently instructedeverything was foreseen and provided for nothing was left to chanceNow let us look closely at the portion of the German line which was tobe assaulted From the village of Auberive page 336 the trenches raneastward Beyond Souain a series of hills lay in front of the Frenchline and on each of them a redoubt had been erected The Germans hadheld this position since the Battle of the Marne and for more than ayear they had striven to make it impregnable In many cases the trencheshad walls of concrete and the wire entanglements were as much as sixtyyards deep In front of the entanglements the ground had beenhoneycombed with mines and strewn with sharpened stakes and obstaclesof all kinds Every German fired from behind a shield of armour plateand at every fifteen yards along the trenches there was a machine gunHere and there were revolving steel turrets each containing aquickfiring gun In some places there were five lines of trenches onebehind the other all linked together so as to form a labyrinth verysimilar to that which the French had captured in Artois Remember thatthese trenches only formed the first line of German defence Behind themwas a second line and between the two were the artillery Lightrailways came right down to the front so that troops and ammunition andsupplies could be moved very readily and speedily The Germans boastedthat they had created an inland Gibraltar and they smiled superior whentheir aviators told them what preparations were going on behind theFrench lines They were quite certain that nothing could shift them[Illustration The Great French Advance in ChampagneBy permission of The GraphicWhile the British advanced between La Basse and Lens the Frenchassaulted the German lines on a seventeenmile front in Champagne Theycarried all before them and captured 21000 prisoners and over 120guns A British surgeon who witnessed the onslaught tells us how theFrench dashed forward like an avalanche They are superb theseFrenchmen]Of course it would never do for the French to attack in Champagne whilethe rest of the Allied troops lay quiet in their trenches The enemymust be engaged at various points all along the line so that he couldnot mass reinforcements against the great attack Further he must notbe allowed to know exactly where the main thrust was to take place TheAllies intended as we shall learn later to make a big offensivebetween La Basse and Lens and to fight holding battles elsewhereEarly in the month of September during perfect autumn weather ageneral bombardment began along the whole front The airmen were verybusy and in the third week of the month there were no fewer thantwentyseven fights over the British front alone On 23rd September thebombardment began to grow very violent The guns had begun the overtureto the great drama on which the curtain was now about to rise                           All was now ready The French trenches were packed with men waiting forthe guns to cease fire and the order to advance Meanwhile the greatestbombardment that the world had ever known was in progress GeneralJoffre had instructed his artillery commanders to smash up the enemystrenches and to destroy their dugouts in such a fashion that may makeit possible for my men to march to the assault with their rifles at theshoulder It is impossible to describe in words the awful din of theguns The sky overhead was a canopy of flying shells and a rain ofdeath fell upon the German trenches Wire entanglements were blown intoa myriad fragments concreted trenches were swept into shapeless ruinand the troops holding them were buried alive in their dugoutsHundreds of men went mad through sheer terror The big shells raisedhuge geysers of earth and smoke wherever they fell and the Frenchgunners stripped to the waist never ceased or slackened their fire forthree days and two nights Upon and behind the German trenches a cascadeof fire continued to fall the enemy could neither advance nor retreatAt 530 on the morning of 25th September the rveill rang out alongthe French lines It was a gray dismal morning but the men were ingood heart They drank their morning coffee looked to their equipmentand waited for the word that would launch them against the foe Everyman wore a patch of white calico on his back so that the French gunnersmight know their own men and not fire upon them At 95 the regimentalflags were unrolled for the first time in this war the troops were togo into action with colours flyingAt 915 the guns suddenly ceased to fire whistles shrilled all alongthe line and bugles pealed the charge En avant Vaincre oumourir[71] shouted the officers and a human wave of bluegrayfifteen miles in length and topped with steel surged from the trenchesOnward with hoarse cheering and snatches of song they went under ahail of fire from the German batteries and from machine guns hurriedlywithdrawn from deep dugouts which the French guns had not wreckedDespite the terrible gunfire stretches of unbroken wire still remainedand amidst these deathtraps many men fell Numerous others were shotdown in front of steel obstacles which had to be blown up before theadvance could proceed Nevertheless the French infantry swept on andplunged into the ruin of the German first line Leaving detachments toferret out prisoners from the deeper dugouts the French made for thesecond line So fierce did the German fire become that they frequentlyhad to lie flat on the ground and crawl forward But in a lull they roseagain to their feet and advanced once more Soon they were on the edgeof the woods where the German field guns unable to get away werefiring at pointblank range They flung themselves upon the guns and ina few seconds had captured whole batteries Prisoners were taken by thehundredbroken stricken men dazed and stupefied by the terriblebombardmentIn some places the assault was pushed into the second German line inother places men still battled furiously in the first line Battalionsbecame mixed up but in a short time order was restored and the troopssurged on again Wounded men cried out to their comrades to leave themand proceed Go on they cried dont mind us Its only you who arewhole who matter now Then the guns came up with a thunderous rumbleand unlimbering like magic prepared the way for a further advance ofthe infantry African troops were ordered up to finish the business withcold steel and behind them came the cavalrydragoons chasseurs andSpahismaking a charge and fighting from the saddle for the first timesince the trench war began They sabred the fleeing Germans and swept uphundreds of prisoners while the trench cleaners as the Algerians andSenegalese are called scoured the ruined earthworks for the lurkingfoeThe most desperate fighting was on the left where the cavalry chargedthe line of wooded hills between Auberive and Souain The Frenchinfantry on the extreme left were held up before they had advancedlittle more than half a mile but later on they took trench aftertrench and by midday were two miles in front of their startingpointIt was in this part of the line that the Colonial troops led by GeneralMarchand[72] made a splendid advance in the course of which theirbrave leader fell He was standing on the parapet of a German trenchsmoking his pipe and urging his men forward when he was struck downAll through the wet afternoon the battle continued and only whentwilight fell was it possible to reckon up the gains of the day On afront of fifteen miles the French had pushed forward on the averagetwo and a half miles Our allies had drawn near to the village ofTahure but they had not captured it neither had they seized theButte[73] of Tahure which overlooks the railway nor the Butte of Mesnilwhich you see to the southeast of Tahure Eastward of the latter hillthere is high ground from which spurs stretch out southwards like theopen fingers of a hand On each of the fingers of this Hand ofMassiges[74] as the French called it the Germans had constructed agreat stronghold of crisscrossed trenches with forts at intervals Itwas as though five labyrinths lay side by side So strong was theposition that the Germans said it could be held against a whole army bytwo washerwomen with machine guns The French however had alreadycarried part of it and also the farmhouse which you see on the westwardedge of the high ground The whole German first line had gone and largeparts of the second line west of Navarin Farm and east of Tahure hadbeen capturedFor every yard of front which the French had won they had taken anunwounded prisoner and for every mile nine guns During the fightingsome 21000 prisoners were captured The Germans surrendered by hundredsat a time Most of them had been without food for several days and weresuffering from thirst and all of them had been completely cowed by theterrible bombardmentThough the French had made such good progress the battle was far fromover German counterattacks were already preparing and might beexpected any moment At all costs the enemy must be prevented frombringing up his reserves and strengthening his remaining line ofdefence So while the French infantry worked like inspired giants allthrough the night digging themselves in building parapets andinstalling their machine guns heavy batteries lumbered and swayedforward over the scarred and pitted ground and began a new bombardmentfrom advanced positions On the next day Sunday all the summits of thedowns were cleared from Auberive to the Butte of Souain A hill facingthe Butte of Tahure was captured by the evening and the northern slopesof the Hand of Massiges were wonBy means of artillery and bomb attacks the line slowly advanced and wasknitted up all along its length The fighting during Sunday was far moretrying than that of Saturday If you only knew what these days andnights are like wrote an officer condemned to remain crouching inthe mud under an avalanche of shells under an almost unceasing rainwith but few supplies brought up in the midst of bodies more or lessmangled by shot and shell and in our ears always the groans of thedying and the moans of the woundedThe Germans rushed up all the men that they could spare from other partsof the line and on Monday the Crown Prince tried to break through theFrench trenches in the Argonne His troops advanced after a gas attackbut they were too weak to do more than carry a few yards It was notnecessary to draw off a single man from the Champagne armies to repulsehimThe second great French effort began on Wednesday 29th September whenan attack was launched against the German position to the west ofNavarin Farm Already the French had pierced the second line on a frontof about fiveeighths of a mile They strove hard to widen the gap sothat the cavalry might push through but again and again they wererepulsed and all that they could do was to dig shelter trenches andcling to the breach in the face of a murderous fire that assailed themin front and in flank With this check the great battle of Champagne maybe said to have ended                           The French had probably about 110000 casualties in the five daysfighting It was estimated that the Germans lost 140000 men including21000 prisoners and 121 guns Despite their great sacrifice of lifethe distance gained by the French was too small to be shown on anordinary map But we shall make a great mistake if we measure the effectof the French effort by the amount of ground gained The aim and objectof generalship is not to occupy territory but to foil the enemys plansand destroy his forces The victory at the Marne stopped any furtherinvasion of France and ruined the German plan while the resistance inFlanders and Artois prevented the enemy from reaching the Channel portsThe Champagne battles threw the enemy upon the defensive it wore downhis numbers and disheartened him and proved that his most stronglyfortified lines could be pierced if the Allies were willing to pay thecost                           Though there was no great offensive on the Western front during the restof the year fighting continued in Champagne during October The Germanssent reserves to this region and on 6th October the French made aneffort to carry the village and Butte of Tahure in order that theymight command the crossrailway which supplied the German front After along and strong bombardment by massed guns the French carried the crestof the Butte and their guns now cut off the Germans in the village fromsupport and reinforcements Then they swept from the west and south intoa wood in which the enemy had constructed seven lines of paralleltrenches and after carrying them entered the village where over athousand prisoners were taken The summit of the Butte was now in thehands of the French and this was the farthest point they reached duringthe year 1915This success and the capture of very strong trenches to the north of theNavarin Farm drove the Germans to desperate efforts They knew thatanother vigorous thrust would push them back from their railway andforce them to retreat On the night of 8th October they made a greatcounterattack on the Butte but achieved nothing Meanwhile their holdon the Butte of Mesnil which formed an awkward sag in the French lineshad been greatly shaken On 24th October the French carried a verypowerful fortress in this position and afterwards beat off numerousattacks They had thus removed a danger from their flank and wereenabled to straighten out their lineOn the 30th of the same month the Germans attacked the Butte of Tahureand retook the summit capturing 21 officers and 1215 men They forcedthe French back to the southern side of the hill but they could do nomore Nevertheless they had eased their position They could still usethe crossrailway for supplying their lines during the winters lullwhich was soon to set in                           A correspondent who visited the battlefields of Champagne during themonth of September tells us that the ground over which the struggle hadraged looked and smelled like a garbage heap Over an area as long asfrom Charing Cross to Hampstead Heath and as wide as from the Bank tothe Marble Arch the earth is pitted with the craters caused by burstingshells as is pitted the face of a man who has had the smallpox Any ofthese shellholes was large enough to hold a barrel many of them wouldhave held a horse I saw one caused by the explosion of a mine whichwe estimated to be seventy feet deep and twice that in diameter In theterrific blast that caused it five hundred German soldiers perishedThe battlefield was thickly covered with unexploded shellshandgrenades and bombs In a captured trench the correspondent saw oneof the steel revolving turrets some six feet high and eight or nine indiameter in which the Germans had installed a quickfiring gun Thedoor of the turret was fastened by a chain and padlock and when burstopen the bodies of three Germans were discovered They had been lockedin by their officers and left to fight and die with no chance ofescape[Footnote 69 In

word for rising ground knoll][Footnote 74 Massseige]  CHAPTER XLIII  THE BATTLE OF LOOSIYou will remember that in order to prevent the Germans from massingtheir forces to resist the great French offensive in Champagne theAllies had prepared attacks on other parts of the enemys line Whilethe French were pushing forward across the miry downs of Champagne sixseparate assaults were launched on the German front between Lens andYpresfour to the north of the La Basse Canal and two to the south ofit The four attacks which were made to the north of the canal weremerely for the purpose of distracting the enemys attention the twoattacks which were made to the south of the canal were part of the mainmovement against the enemys lines of communication While the French inChampagne strove to capture the railway by which the Germans maintainedthemselves in this region the French and British tried to seize therailway junction of Lens and open a road into the plain of the ScheldtHad these thrusts from the south and the west fully succeeded the enemywould have been forced to retire probably into BelgiumI shall not trouble you with an account of the holding attacks whichwere made to the north of the La Basse Canal Three of them servedtheir purpose and resulted in some gains but the fourth which was madeagainst the Aubers Ridge came to grief The two attacks which I shalldescribe at length are those which were made by the French and theBritish south of the canalTurn back to the map on page 223 and find the village of Souchez Southand east of this village you observe that there is high ground which isnowhere more than 400 feet above sealevel This high ground is known asthe Vimy Heights from the name of the village which you see by the sideof the railway line running from Arras to Lens On 26th September theFrench began to attack these heights and by the morning of the 29thhad fought their way up them foot by foot and were in a position tocommand the railway from Lens to Arras I wish I had space to describethis fine achievement fully As however this book is specially meantfor British boys and girls I must pass over the splendid work done bythe French in capturing the Vimy Heights and turn to the exploits ofour own men By winning the Vimy Heights the French had cut off Lensfrom Arras the British were now to try to cut off Lens from La BasseLook carefully at the map on page 349 and follow the German first lineof trenches from north to south Less than a mile and a half south ofthe canal and about half a mile inside the German line you see aposition marked Fosse 8 and south of it the Hohenzollern Redoubt Fosse8 was a great slag heap which commanded the country to the south and hadbeen strongly fortified The Hohenzollern Redoubt was a pearshapedstronghold situated on a gentle rise about 500 yards in front of theline Its broad end pointed northwards and it had a clear field of firebefore it every inch of which could be swept by the machine gunsinside The whole position was crisscrossed by trenches and resembledthe famous Labyrinth It was connected with the main line by twotrenches That which ran to the rear from the south end was called BigWillie and the corresponding trench at the north end was known asLittle WillieSouth of the Hohenzollern Redoubt the line ran along the western slopeof the downs which you see marked on the map Then the line curvedwestwards passing the Loos Redoubt and after crossing the BthuneLensroad curved back eastwards in front of what was known as DoubleCrassier[75] another slag heap which had been strongly fortifiedNow look at the German reserve line which was roughly parallel with thefront line and from less than a mile to two miles behind it Notice theQuarries which had been turned into a stronghold and the miningvillage of Loos which lies in a shallow hollow Behind the villagerises Hill 70 on which there was a strong redoubt[Illustration Battle of LoosThe Front from La Basse to Lens]Now follow the third line Behind it you will see a string of miningvillagesHaisnes[76] Cit St Elie and Hulluch The line crossed theLensLa Basse road at Hulluch and then ran a little east and southbehind a chalk pit and Pit No 14 The villages and the pits which Ihave mentioned were fortresses and there were numerous other mounds andhillocks that had been turned into strongholdsFrom the British front the country seemed a deadflat plain studded withthe headgear of pits and groups of small houses and seamed with roadsThere was scarcely a tree in sight and except for the collieries andslag heaps the plain looked something like the South African veldtBut behind the downs which shut in the view of our men facing thenorthern half of the line there were innumerable places where batteriesof machine guns lay concealedThe map shows you that two corps of the First Army under Sir DouglasHaig were arrayed for the assault The 1st Corps under GeneralGough[77] consisted of the 2nd 9th and 7th Divisions the 2ndDivision lay north of the canal the 9th Division opposite to Fosse 8and the 7th Division facing the Quarries The 9th Division consisted ofScottish regimentsHighland and Lowland kilties and men wearing thetrews South of the road from Vermelles to Hulluch lay the 4th ArmyCorps under General Sir Henry Rawlinson The 1st Division of hiscommand was posted just south of the road opposite to the Loos Redoubtwas the 15th Division also a wholly Scottish division composed of menof the new army This division had been for three months or more in thetrenches facing Loos and it was well acquainted with the ground overwhich it was soon to charge On the extreme right was the 47th Divisionof Londoners                           When the guns began to roar in Champagne the British artillery alongthe whole fivemile front from Givenchy to Grenay joined in the tumultAcross the plain a tornado of shells swept upon the German positionsand in many places the trenches were pounded into utter ruin At 630 onthe morning of 25th September the guns lifted their muzzles and thehigh explosive shells rained a deluge of fire behind the first line ofGerman defence Then the whistles blew and five miles of British troopswith fixed bayonets clambered over their trenches The great advance hadbegun[Illustration The Storming of Loos Road RedoubtBy permission of The Illustrated London NewsThis redoubt see map page 349 was a fortified tongue of land juttingout of the German firstline trench It was semicircular in form andwas protected by a perfect jungle of barbed wire entanglements TheBritish guns smashed the redoubt to ruin and on September 25 1915 itwas carried See page 357]We will first follow the fortunes of the 9th Division now making forFosse 8 and the Hohenzollern Redoubt Enfilading fire from the villageof Auchy streamed down upon the Lowlanders on the left and took a heavytoll of them as they advanced Nevertheless they pushed on crossed therailway and in a few minutes were thrusting and bombing in the Germantrenches So fierce however was the fire that they could not cling tothem and slowly during the day they were driven back Meanwhile the26th Highland Brigade on the right had rushed the Hohenzollern RedoubtThe bombardment had wrecked it and saps had been run up to within ashort distance of Little Willie Our losses were heavy but thestronghold was wonCamerons Seaforths and Black Watch now advanced over a bareshellswept piece of ground towards Fosse 8 from which a hail ofmachinegun fire beat down upon them like a thunderstorm in autumn Asthe Lowlanders on their left had been held up and their flank was inthe air the 27th Brigade was hurried up in support and was soon busywith bomb and bayonet in the maze of trenches and cottages to the eastof the Fosse By midday we had pushed forward a broad salient on thispart of the line and had captured the chief works of the enemy thoughthe Germans were not entirely cleared out of them The rear was sostudded with little forts each pouring out a murderous fire thatlittle further progress could be made Our men fell fast and as we hadbut few reserves it was clear that we could not long hold on to ourgains in this part of the lineNow let us see how the 7th Division was faring There were no greatstrongholds in their front so they swept forward right across theGerman first line and reached the western end of the Quarries wherefor a time the Reserve Line held them up Nevertheless the van pushedon entered the village of Cit St Elie gained the highroad turnednorthwards and by ten oclock was in the village of Haisnes Judgingfrom the map you would say that the Germans still clinging to theeastern edges of Fosse 8 and Hohenzollern Redoubt were now taken betweentwo fires and that nothing could save them But the vanguard which hadpushed northwards along the highroad to Haisnes was not strong enoughto hold on to the village and by midday it had fallen back and thefront of the 7th Division lay from the western side of the Quarrieseastwards to Cit St Elie In the Quarries was a German howitzerbattery which we could not destroy and the enemy could not use[Footnote 75 Krassea][Footnote 76 Haine][Footnote 77 Killed by a chance bullet on October 24 1915]  CHAPTER XLIV  THE BATTLE OF LOOSIIThe 1st Division lying to the south of the 7th Division made excellentprogress Its 1st Brigade swept forward for a mile and threequartersand by noon was across the highroad on the outskirts of Hulluch and upagainst the last German line On the right however the 2nd Brigade waschecked by wire and trenches which our artillery had not destroyed andit lay pinned to the ground till afternoon when reserves were sent upthrough the wide rent which we shall learn later had been torn in theGerman lines by the 15th Division These reserves cut off and captured aGerman detachment 700 strong and enabled the 2nd Brigade to go forwardand join the 1st Brigade in front of HulluchNow we come to the most brilliant advance of the day that which wasmade by the 15th and 47th Divisions against Loos This advance resultedas you will learn in the capture of the village and shook the wholeGerman front For a brief time the Germans thought that all was lostand they began to move their big guns out of Lens The 47th Division ofLondoners meant to make good that day For weeks they had been busywith preparations and when the hour arrived everything went likeclockwork They had constructed a big model of the countryside and hadstudied it so well that every man knew the lie of the ground andexactly where he had to go One battalionthe 19th Londonlost all itsofficers yet the men went on without them and carried out the arrangedplan without a mistake The 18th London Irish the 19th St Pancrasand the 20th Blackheath and Woolwich were on the left of the attackand the 6th 7th and 8th Post Office Rifles on the right Cannot youimagine the amazement of the French gunners who watched the start whenthey saw one of the London Irish kick off a football from the parapetand dribble it towards the German lines[Illustration British Troops swarming over the German First LineTrenches and dashing onwards towards Loos the Tower Bridge and Hill70From the drawing by S Begg By permission of The Illustrated LondonNewsNotice the Tower Bridge as it was called by our soldiers It was theheadgear of a pit and consisted of twin towers connected by a bridgeIt had been seen by our men foreshortened over the downs for manymonths past They believed that the Germans had constructed it beforethe war as an observation station]In half an hour the stronghold of the Double Crassier had been carriedand the men of the 47th Division were pushing on to the village of Loosthrough clouds of bursting shrapnel Before long they had seized thecemetery and their left was on the outskirts of the village A fewminutes later and they were surging into the shattered streets of Looswhere they joined hands with the Highlanders of the 15th Divisionbeneath the Tower Bridge Then began a fierce and deadly struggleEvery ruined house was packed with Germans from cellar to garret themuzzles of rifles and machine guns peeped out of every window andthrough every grating Through the wet slippery streets went our menbursting through barricades battering down doors fighting upstairs anddownstairs bombing the enemy out of cellars slag heaps andpitworkings and gradually clearing the place In a deep cellar aGerman officer was discovered directing by telephone the fire of thebatteries which were smashing the ruined village to atoms So thefierce red work went on and by nine in the morning Loos was won                           The inhabitants of Loos were overjoyed when the British entered thevillage and set them free from German bondage Though the place had beenheavily shelled for many months some of the people had lived in theircellars all the time When our men appeared they came out of theirhidingplaces and while doing so some of them were killed Theremainder however were sent to a place of safety and were given foodSome of the women greeted the Highlanders with hearty kisses A prettygirl of eighteen named Emilienne Moreau was one of the first to assistour wounded She helped to carry in the stricken men and to bandagethem As the poor helpless fellows lay on their stretchers two Germansnipers in a neighbouring house opened fire on them This was more thanthe brave girl could bear Suddenly without a word she bent downbeside a wounded officer and took his revolver out of his holster Armedwith this weapon she disappeared down a side street and made her way tothe house in which the snipers were hidden She managed to get inside bymeans of a side entrance and taking steady aim shot them both Suchis the story of the girl who will go down to history as the heroine ofLoos On November 27 1915 she was decorated with the French MilitaryCross When General de Sailly pinned the decoration on her breast hesaid I congratulate and admire you young lady You do honour to thewomen of France You are a fine and inspiring example And so say allof us                           The most remarkable success of the day was obtained by the 15thDivision Let me remind you that this division consisted of Scottishsoldiers and that they lay in front of the Loos Redoubt The 44thBrigade of this division was to make its thrust direct at the villagethe 46th Brigade on the left was to sweep round and enter it on thenorth side while the 45th Brigade was held in reserve We will nowfollow the fortunes of the 9th Black Watch and the 8th Seaforths of the44th Brigade They were now about to assault the village the 7thCamerons were in support and the 10th Gordons were to follow onDo you remember the great gas attack of the Germans at the Second Battleof Ypres You will remember what a shock of horror went through thecivilized world when the Germans resorted to this foul weapon We hadnever dreamed of sending clouds of poisoned gas against our enemies butnow we were forced to pay them back in their own coin Many people athome thought that we ought to refrain from using gas but our generalsthought otherwise and in times of warfare their word is law But thegas which we were now about to use was not poisoned It was far lesshurtful than that of the Germans Men who breathed it were renderedinsensible for a time they were neither killed nor subjected tohorrible tortures We also used for the first time in this battleclouds of smoke to screen our advanceAt ten minutes to six on the morning of 25th September the nozzles ofthe gas cylinders in front of our trenches were opened and the menwatched anxiously as the whitish cloud moved slowly upwards towards theGerman lines near the crown of the slope A very light wind blew fromthe southwest and in the hollow where Loos stands formed an eddy whichblew back the gas on to the 46th Brigade Our men were wearing their gashelmets but for a moment the choking cloud caused them to hesitatewhereupon Piper Daniel Laidlaw climbed the parapet and played a marchthat put new heart into his comrades You will learn on a later pagethat he received the Victoria Cross for this fine deedThe Highlanders saw before them the line of greengray sandbags whichthey had watched through their periscopes day by day for months pastThe parapets of the enemy which had so long barred their way were soonto be the startingpoint for their advance Now the great guns got towork and in less than half an hour the barrier was crushed and poundedinto ruin The wire was blown into a million fragments and the parapetswere utterly destroyed The strong redoubt of Loos was raked fore andaft and the German trenches were full of deadAt 630 the whistles blew the Highlanders scrambled over the parapetsand with a rush dashed into the wrecked trenches At five minutes pastseven the whole of the German first line position several trenchesdeep was in their hands Even in the first rush many men were mown downby the machine guns which desperate Germans had hidden in deep dugoutsand had brought into play when the bombardment ceased But nothing couldstay the Scots On they went cheering and singing through the reekingcloud of gas and smoke and in a few minutes were rushing down the slopetowards Loos The entanglements of the reserve line had been broken inmany places but here and there patches of uncut wire remained and theBlack Watch had to cut them under heavy fire The ground was carpetedwith their dead but they did not waver they swarmed over the reserveline and at twenty minutes to eight an hour and ten minutes after theyhad left their trenches they were shooting and stabbing and hurlingbombs in the four rambling streets and in the gardens and enclosures ofLoos along with their comrades of the 47th Division who had enteredfrom the south One Cameron sergeant was seen with a machine gun on hisshoulder pouring a stream of bullets into window after window The 46thBrigade was rapidly closing in from the north Two and a half hoursafter the advance began Loos was clear of the enemy[Illustration A Scottish Highlander rescuing a French Girl in theVillage of LoosMany moving incidents took place when the British entered Loos Many ofthe inhabitants who had been living in the cellars came out to heapblessings on the head of their deliverers A Highlander is here seencarrying a fainting French girl into a place of safety]The Highlanders however were not content It was their business notonly to take Loos but to capture the broad down marked on the map asHill 70 and some of them believed that when it was won supports wouldfollow them and they were to push on as far as they could The remnantsof the Highland Brigade with Camerons and Gordons leading now rushedup the western slope of Hill 70 and were at once met by a fierce fireThe Germans came out of their trenches as if to attack and at the sightthe Highlanders streamed up the hill like hares the green tartans ofthe Gordons mingling with those of the Camerons They were fired at fromfront and flank but on they swept carrying all before them and bynine in the morning they were on the summit of the hillThey stormed the redoubt at the top and many of the garrisonsurrendered Without pausing to secure the place they sped down theeastern slope and reached the outskirts of the village of Cit StAuguste They were now right through the last line of German trenchesand were in a district where every fold in the ground sheltered amachine gun By this time they were reduced to a few hundreds they hadno supports south or north and no reserves were following them up Theredoubt on Hill 70 opened fire again while from several strongholds inthe neighbourhood streams of lead played upon them In the course ofthree hours they had advanced nearly four miles and the last line ofthe German defence was in their rear Had reserves been available andhad their flanks been secure Lens must have fallen and the Germans musthave retreatedThe Highlanders had gone too far and they were now hidden in the fogand smoke of the eastern slope from the eyes of their comrades who werebattling against the redoubt on the hill They must be recalled and twoofficers volunteered to go forward with the order to retire Both fellon the way but the order reached the stragglers who turned and beganto fight their way back through the encircling fire Few of themreturned to the British lines on the hill All down the slope towardsLens lay the tartans Gordon and Black Watch Seaforth and Cameron likethe drift left on the shore when the tide has ebbedYou will probably ask Where were the reserves at this time Why werethey not brought up promptly so that the gains of the Highlanders mightbe made good There was a whole army corps in reserve Where was it atthis critical time Sir John French tells us that he kept it under hisown command so that he might throw it into that part of the line wherethe need was greatest On the night before the battle two divisions ofthis corps were about five miles from our old firingline anotherdivisionthe Guardslay nearly twenty miles from Loos while otherdivisions were still more remote All the reserves which Sir DouglasHaig possessed at the beginning of the battle consisted of the 3rdCavalry Division After the fall of Loos when the Highlanders were infront of Cit St Auguste Sir John French sent him the 21st and 24thDivisions At that time they were about eight miles from our front andthey could not possibly arrive before the German counterattacks beganLong before they appeared the enemy was hurrying up fresh troops andflinging them against our worn and weary men All through the drizzlingrain of the afternoon until the sun set in a stormy sky our men wereheavily assailed They were clinging to their gains but their hold onFosse 8 on Pit 14 and on Hill 70 was weakeningThrough the wet dark night two divisions of the Eleventh Army marchedtowards the firingline in order to relieve two brigades of the 15thDivision They were quite new to the work of war and some of them hadonly landed in France a few days before Sir John French had reviewedthem and had been struck by their fine martial appearance and he nowproposed to send them into the thick of the fighting On the morning ofSunday one of these divisions began to advance towards the trenchesacross open ground under a terrible fire It was an ordeal too great forany unseasoned troops and they gave wayThe German counterattacks continued all night The 7th Division weredriven out of their trenches at the Quarries but in the afternoon ofSunday they regained the lost ground By this time the 21st and 24thDivisions had arrived One brigade of the 24th Division pushed forwardmost gallantly between Hulluch and the Chalk Pit but the advance wascarried too far and in the afternoon it was forced to retrace its stepswith heavy losses Meanwhile the 21st Division had to bear the brunt ofa very heavy German attack The men had been without food and water formany hours and were worn out with much fighting Three times theirofficers rallied them but they were forced back and our advancedpositions towards Hulluch were lost Some of the trenches on Hill 70 hadalso been recaptured and it was feared that we could not hold on to therising ground much longer Many a British soldier half dead withfatigue his eyes bloodshot and bleared with powder smoke lookedanxiously to the rear and muttered beneath his breath Will thereserves never comeThe Guards were coming up but they were then eight miles away and werenot being hurried for they were intended to carry on the next stage ofthe advance The fate of the two new divisions had upset all the plansand troops that had been withdrawn from the trenches had to be sent backagain The 45th Brigade of the 15th Division was ordered to retake thelost ground on Hill 70 It advanced but was met by a terrible shellfire and could not proceed Four times LieutenantColonel DouglasHamilton led forward the Camerons he fell at the head of the fifty menwho alone survived The position of affairs was now desperate and itcontinued to be so all that day and all through the following night Soweak were our lines during the hours of darkness that the Germans couldeasily have driven us out of Loos had they made an attack in force Notuntil Monday at noon did the Guards arrive and take over the front fromthe heroic 15th Division In the two days fighting it had lost morethan 6000 men The fiery spirit of the Gael and the dogged endurance ofthe Lowlander had added new glory to the fighting fame of ScotlandNothing was more surprising in the Battle of Loos than the high spiritsof our men even in the darkest hour of trial Even the badly woundedcame out of action singing and waving bloodstained bayonets Those whowere sent back to billets woke from their muchneeded sleep ready andeven eager to plunge again into the fray During the wet and mistyMonday Sir Douglas Haig was reinforced by the 28th Division but beforeit could arrive we had lost Fosse 8 and the Germans were bombing ourmen out of the Hohenzollern RedoubtIn the afternoon the news spread like wildfire that the Guards weregoing in They were now to take the field for the first time in thiswar as a division and great things were expected of them They were towin back the threequarters of a mile of ground which we had lostbetween Hulluch and the LoosLa Basse road and right nobly did they doit The 1st Brigade carried all before it and reached the road theIrish Guards and the Coldstreams of the 2nd Brigade also crossed theroad and facing a terrific fire which lost them their colonel andeleven officers carried the Chalk Pit while the Welsh Guards and theGrenadiers of the 3rd Brigade advancing as though on parade sweptthrough Loos and advanced through a storm of gas shells towards Hill70 As they pushed on the wearied Londoners and the other troopsholding our line cheered themselves hoarse The Guards gained the crestof the hill but being too much exposed to fire from the Redoubt dug inabout a hundred yards to the west of itNext day a very determined effort was made to carry Pit 14 but itfailed and the muchdebated ground became a No Mans Land which neitherside dared cross The battle was now drawing to a close While the enemycontinued to shell our trenches we laboured to strengthen our lines Ona front of 6500 yards we had everywhere carried the enemys first lineand broken up his reserve line while in one case we had pushed throughhis last position We had captured over 3000 of the enemy and more thanfifty of his officers Twentysix field guns and forty machine guns aswell as much war material had fallen into our hands Some of these gunswere afterwards exhibited in London and in other parts of the kingdom astrophies of warThe Battle of Loos was a real success It had resulted in useful gainsand it had proved that our infantry were second to none in the worldBut even in the midst of our rejoicings we could not help feelingdisappointment Much had been done but more might have been done Wehad struck a weak place in the enemys line but we were not ready totake full advantage of our good luck Our first push had given us muchground but we could not proceed because our reserves were not ready tofollow up the advance For twentyfour hoursfrom Saturday at middayuntil noon on Mondaybroken and weary brigades clung heroically to thepositions which they had won waiting for supports to arrive There wasmismanagement somewherethe same sort of mismanagement which we hadsuffered at Neuve Chapelle and Festubert Our generals had not yet fullylearnt the lessons of the new warfare They were learning them in thebest possible of all schools but at a great cost of human life andeffort Between the 25th of September and the 1st of October we lostabout 45000 men many of whom however were only slightly wounded TheFrench Staff calculated that the Germans had lost in the Septemberbattles not less than 200000For the first time for hundreds of years there was widespread mourningthroughout Great Britain The men of the new armies came from everyclass in the nation and many households which had never before had asoldier son were plunged in grief Three commanders of divisions fellthree Members of Parliament and many who had distinguished themselvesin civilian life as scholars or as captains of industry But we knowthat all who fell whether distinguished or undistinguished generals orprivates played their parts like men for the land of their love andpride Somewhere in Flanders there is a grave above which a wooden crossbears these words  Tell England ye that pass this monument   That we who rest here died contentEqually content were those gallant men who fell in Artois during theclosing days of September                           The results of the fighting in the West from 1st October to the end ofthe year may be summed up very briefly Both in Champagne and on theBritish front between the La Basse Canal and Lens the Germans madefierce counterattacks but nowhere did they win more than momentarysuccesses On the 8th of October they assembled behind the Chalk Pitand came on in four great waves marching shoulder to shoulder only tobe shattered to fragments by our fire Five days later we launched anattack against the German line between the Hohenzollern Redoubt andHulluch but though we won a thousand yards of trenches we could notremain in them By this time nearly all the Redoubt and Fosse 8 had beenrecovered by the Germans and on 13th October we began a three daysattack upon these positions The North Midland Division covered itselfwith glory during two crowded days of incessant battle The mostdesperate handtohand fighting took place and many notable deeds ofgallantry were done We won the main trench of the Redoubt but no moreAt the end of October our line was a little farther forward than it hadbeen at the beginning of the month but when we came to reckon up thelosses of friend and foe it was hard to say on which side the balancelay Thereafter to the end of the winter both sides settled down tothe long weariness of trench warfare  CHAPTER XLV  BRAVEST OF THE BRAVEIThe fighting on the Western front from the beginning of the Septemberoffensive to the close of the year abounded in heroic

story I am now about to relate finds afitting place in this roll of heroes Miss Cavell was the daughter ofthe Rev Frederick Cavell for forty years Vicar of Swardeston NorfolkShe was trained as a nurse at the London Hospital and in 1900 becamehead of a nursing institution in Brussels Every one who knew heradmired her noble character she followed in the footsteps of thegreatest of all nursesFlorence Nightingale[Illustration The Martyrdom of Edith CavellFrom the picture by A Forestier By permission of The IllustratedLondon NewsWhen the news of Nurse Cavells murder was received the followingmessage was sent to her mother By command of the King and Queen Iwrite to assure you that the hearts of their Majesties go out to you inyour bitter sorrow and to express their horror at the appalling deedwhich has robbed you of your child Men and women throughout thecivilized world while sympathizing with you are moved to admirationand awe at her faith and courage in death]When the Germans occupied Brussels Nurse Cavell was allowed to remain atthe head of her hospital She and her assistants nursed German andBelgian wounded with equal devotion During the retreat of the Alliesfrom Namur and Mons a large number of British and French soldiers werecut off or lost their units Many of them were discovered and shotothers hid themselves in trenches woods or deserted houses and someof them were sheltered by friendly farmers who gave them civilianclothing and helped them to escape into Holland Many Belgian soldiersalso lay in hiding waiting for a chance to get out of the country Someof the fugitives hearing of Nurse Cavell managed to get into touchwith her and asked her to help them to escape This she did Shebelieved that she was only doing her duty to her country in coming totheir assistanceSpies informed the Germans of what she was doing and on August 5 1915she was arrested and put in prison Mr Brand Whitlock the AmericanMinister in Brussels pleaded for her but in vain Her trial began on7th October and she was found guilty of acting as a spy The Germanskept the sentence as secret as possible and on the evening of Monday11th October Miss Cavell was informed that she would be shot at twooclock the next morningThe British chaplain who visited Miss Cavell on the eve of her executionfound her very calm and resigned She was brave and bright to the lastShe professed her Christian faith and said that she was glad to die forher countryIt is said that the final scene was horrible Miss Cavell so it wasreported fainted on the way to execution and was shot by the officerin command of the firing party as she lay unconscious When the newsleaked out a wave of horror and loathing swept over all theworldexcept Germany At home Nurse Cavell was mourned alike in palaceand in cottage A memorial service was held in St Pauls and manyplans were proposed for keeping her beautiful memory green On thebattlefield our men charged with the cry For Miss Cavell and theFrench hailed her as a new Joan of Arc In the long black list ofGerman atrocities there is no more inhuman deed than the murder of NurseCavell  CHAPTER XLVII  THE WAR IN THE AIROver and over in these pages you have read of airy navies grappling inthe central blue Every soldier fighting his battles over again by thehome fireside loves to describe the aeroplanes that hovered above histrench while white fleecy clouds of shrapnel burst around them Noreturning soldier but can thrill his hearers with stories of deadlycombats in the high heavens The exploits of aircraft in this war open anew chapter of military historyNothing is more remarkable than the rapid progress which has been madein the conquest of the air In October 1897 a daring man succeeded inflying about three hundred yards in October 1915 men frequently madeflights of hundreds of miles Twenty years ago the aeroplane wasunknown today it is a recognized arm of warfare No army or navy dareenter upon war without its air serviceOur French allies were the pioneers of these new powers of the air andwhen war broke out they were well equipped with aircraft It is saidthat at the close of the year 1915 they possessed more than threethousand aeroplanes and that the number was being constantly increasedFrench aircraft are divided into three classes according as they are tobe used for scouting for fire control or for bombardment The scoutingmachines are of various kinds and include a new type of small machineknown as the Baby Nieuport This machine which only carries a pilotis no more than 25 feet wide but it has a motor of 80 horsepower andcan attain the amazing speed of 120 miles an hour The Baby Nieuportscan rise higher and quicker than an eagle[Illustration A German Machine brought down and fired by a BritishBattleplaneFrom the drawing by John de G Bryan By permission of The IllustratedLondon NewsThis picture illustrates the splendid feat by which Second LieutenantInsall won the Victoria Cross See page 384]The machines used for directing artillery fire are bigger and carry oneor more observers as well as the pilot They usually have two motorsso that they can still fly if one of them is put out of action Formaking raids still bigger machines are used In 1915 the French pinnedtheir faith to a giant triplane which well deserved to be called theDreadnought of the Air It was 63 feet from wing to wing it was drivenby four powerful motors carried two quickfiring cannon and fourmachine guns as well as 1200 pounds of explosives and on a raid wasmanned by a crew of four menYou have frequently read in these pages of the scouting work done byaeroplanes When they fly over the enemys lines they have huge camerasfitted to the bodies of the machines Exposures are made and themachine speeds back to its own lines usually amid a storm of burstingshrapnel Every aerodrome has a dark room in which the plates aredeveloped An enlargement is made and the staff is thus provided with apicture of the German trenches as seen from above If a good photographis taken the positions appear as clear as daylight even the barbedwire and the situation and number of the machine guns can be seen Poorphotographs however do not show the details and cannot distinguish atrench from a watercourse Sometimes large kites are used forphotographic purposesYou can easily understand what a great change the aeroplane has producedin warfare when I tell you that during the RussoJapanese War theJapanese fought for weeks and sacrificed thousands of men in order tocapture the top of a hill from which their observers could overlook PortArthur Nowadays an aeroplane can supply all the information needed in asingle hour and howitzers can be directed from the air so that theirshells will drop on the required position though the gunners cannotpossibly see their targetsA modern general would be almost lost without his air service From dawnto dark aircraft hover over the enemys position photographing histrenches spotting his batteries noticing the movement of troops andtrains and bringing back priceless information More than once Frenchaeroplanes have landed spies behind the German lines and have returnedto pick them up again days laterWe British were the last of the great European nations to applythemselves to the air but by the outbreak of war we were well equippedThe British Royal Flying Corps consisted of a military and a naval wingEach wing was divided into squadrons consisting of twentyfouraeroplanes and twentyfour pilots under a major or commander Thesquadron was in turn divided into six flights each flight comprisingfour machines Every squadron had its own motor wagons and armouredmotor cars Our airmen if they were not so skilful as the French werecompetent and very daring and had been trained to act with other armsThe Germans at first gave most of their attention to airships but theywere also provided with a strong force of aeroplanes The Austrianservice though it contained some skilful pilots was much inferior tothat of Germany while the Russians were short of machines though theypossessed giant biplanes which could carry over a ton weight ofexplosivesAs far back as Christmas Day 1914 our airmen made raids upon fortifiedplaces in Germany Seven seaplanes escorted by cruisers and submarinesflew over Cuxhaven where German warships were lying and dropped bombswhich it is said destroyed one or more Zeppelin sheds Three of theaviators returned to the escorting ships safely three others who wererescued by submarines had to destroy their machines in order to preventthem from falling into the hands of the enemy and the seventh waspicked up by a Dutch trawler On January 22 1915 another raid was madeby two of our aviators on the new German naval base of Zeebrugge Asubmarine lying in the harbour was destroyed and probably other damagewas done Commander Davies one of the two British aviators had a mostadventurous home journey At one time he was surrounded by seven of theenemys craft He managed to elude them however and returned safelybut slightly woundedRaids such as these increased in number as the year advanced On 11thFebruary thirtyfour of our seaplanes and aeroplanes made another attackon Zeebrugge under the leadership of Commander Samson whose daring hasalready been mentioned in these pages[78] Great damage was done andfive days later the visit was repeated Forty machines including eightbelonging to the French dropped bombs on various batteries and gunpositions on an aerodrome and on minesweepers off the shore Duringthe Battle of Neuve Chapelle the railways in the rear of the Germanlines were bombarded and the junction at Courtrai seventeen miles eastof Ypres was destroyed On a later page I shall tell you how SecondLieutenant W B RhodesMoorhouse won the Victoria Cross and lost hislife during this raid On 7th June two of our airmen destroyed anairshed and a Zeppelin north of BrusselsIt is impossible in these pages to describe all the air raids of theyear Each was much like the other except for the number of themachines engaged and the extent of the damage done As an illustrationI will give you a brief account of the great French raid on the Germancity of Karlsruhe on 3rd June It was made in retaliation for Zeppelinraids on open French and British towns and was the biggest enterpriseof the kind so far undertaken Twentythree aeroplanes set out at thefirst flush of dawn Mr E A Powell in Vive la France thus describesthe progress of the raid    So rapid was the pace at which the aeroplanes were travelling    that it was not yet six oclock when the commander of the    squadron peering through his glasses saw far below him the    yellow gridiron which he knew to be the streets the splotches    of green which he knew to be the parks and the squares of red    and gray which he knew to be the buildings of Karlsruhe The    first warning that the townsfolk had was when a dynamite shell    came plunging out of nowhere and exploded with a crash that    rocked the city to its foundations The people of Karlsruhe were    being given a dose of the same medicine which the Zeppelins had    given to Antwerp to Paris and to London    For nearly an    hour it rained bombs Holes as large as cellars suddenly    appeared in the stonepaved streets and squares buildings of    brick and stone and concrete crashed to the ground as though    flattened by the hand of God fires broke out in various    quarters of the city and raged unchecked the terrified    inhabitants cowered in their cellars or ran in blind panic for    the open country the noise was terrific for bombs were falling    at the rate of a dozen to the minute beneath that rain of death    Karlsruhe rocked and reeledOf the four squadrons which set out for Karlsruhe only two machinesfailed to return The Germans were furious and the Kaiser telegraphedhis deep indignation at the wicked attack on beloved Karlsruhe He hadconveniently forgotten the murderous raids of his own Zeppelins[Footnote 78 See Vol III page 74]  CHAPTER XLVIII  HEROES OF THE AIRBefore I describe very briefly the Zeppelin raids upon England let meset down the names and exploits of the five gallant airmen who wereawarded the Victoria Cross during the year 1915Second Lieutenant William Barnard RhodesMoorhouse Royal Flying CorpsThe first Victoria Cross ever conferred on an airman was won byLieutenant RhodesMoorhouse for extraordinary daring and enduranceduring the raid on Courtrai which I mentioned on page 381 Whiledropping his bombs he descended to 300 feet and was furiously assailedby antiaircraft guns which seriously wounded him in the thigh Hedetermined to save his machine at all costs and made for home flyingat a height of only 100 feet Though again wounded he did not losecontrol of his machine but flew thirtyfive miles to his base where helanded and made his report as if nothing had happened Shortlyafterwards he died in hospital of his woundsFlight SubLieutenant R A J Warneford RNOn the morning of June 7 1915 Lieutenant Warneford who was flying ina very light monoplane sighted a Zeppelin between Ghent and Brusselsand made straight for it While approaching it he was too low and wasfired at by the Zeppelins guns Keeping to the rear of the airship heclimbed upwards by a series of jerks until he was well above it Thenhe swooped down until he was only fifty feet above the great gas bagand dropped six bombs the last of which burst the Zeppelins envelopeA loud explosion followed and the airship fell to the ground in themidst of smoke and flame The force of the explosion turned his machineupside down but he succeeded in righting it Shortly afterwards hispressure pump failed to work and he was obliged to come down in theGerman lines He got out of the machine repaired the pump scrambledin again and soared off For two and a half hours he continued flyingand then he came down happily behind his own lines He was so wearythat he fell fast asleep by the side of the machine and was finallydiscovered by French soldiers only twenty yards from the cliffs ofGrisnez[79] The story of his brilliant feat was flashed over theworld and his name at once became a household word in two continentsHe had by superb courage and skill destroyed the first of theZeppelins in flight The Allies vied with each other in doing himhonour but alas his career which promised so much was soon broughtto a close Ten days later while trying a new machine at Versailles hewas thrown out and killedCaptain Lance George Hawker DSO Royal Engineers and Royal FlyingCorpsOn 19th April Captain Hawker dropped bombs on a German airshed from aheight of only 200 feet He was under heavy fire all the time and ranterrible risks To avoid the shells hurled at him he took refuge behinda German captive balloon and was enabled to make good his escape Forthis feat he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order On 25th Julywhen flying alone he fell in with three German aeroplanes and attackedthem one after the other The first escaped but he damaged the secondand third so badly that they were forced to descend For this splendidfeat he received the VCCaptain John Aidan Liddell 3rd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders andRoyal Flying CorpsDuring a scouting flight from Ostend to Ghent an enemy shot brokeCaptain Liddells thigh smashed the control wheel and otherwisedamaged his machine For a brief time he was unconscious and hismachine dropped nearly 3000 feet With a great effort he pulled himselftogether and though continually fired at managed to bring hisaeroplane into our own lines half an hour after he had been woundedOnly an airman can appreciate the extraordinary skill and determinationwhich the wounded officer displayedSecond Lieutenant Gilbert Stuart Martin Insall No 11 Squadron RoyalFlying CorpsOn 7th November Lieutenant Insall was out patrolling with a mechanic asgunner when he was sighted and attacked by a German machine With greatskill he got to close range with his opponent and his gunner fired adrum of cartridges which brought the German aeroplane to the groundWhen the Germans scrambled out of their machine Lieutenant Insall divedtowards them and his gunner opened fire on them and they fled An enemyparty now fired at him but undeterred he dropped a bomb on the fallenmachine and set it on fire He then flew over the German positions anddescended so low that his gunner was able to fire on the German trenchesas they passed over them His petrol tank was damaged and he was forcedto land in a wood inside our lines At once the enemys artillery openedfire on him and some 150 shells fell around the machine as it lay onthe ground That night behind screened lights he repaired his machineand at dawn flew home safely with his gunnerSquadron Commander Richard Bell Davies DSO RNCommander Davies was the hero of one of the most striking incidentsknown to aerial warfare On 19th November lieutenant Smylie made a raidupon the Turkish railway station of Ferijik on the Turkish riverMaritza He planed down over the station and dropped all his bombs butone While doing so his machine was badly hit and he had to come toearth in a neighbouring marsh In order to prevent the enemy fromcapturing his machine he set it on fire He had hardly done so when hesaw Commander Davies coming to his rescue Fearing that the commanderwould descend near the burning machine and thus run the risk of beingblown up by the remaining bomb Lieutenant Smylie took out a pistolfired at the missile and exploded it Then Commander Davies swoopeddown picked up the lieutenant and hurried off with all speed intosafety Seldom if ever has such a feat of pluck and gallantry beenperformed[Footnote 79 Greenay French cape fronting the Strait of Dover]  CHAPTER XLIX  THE COMING OF THE ZEPPELINSOn page 144 of our first volume I gave you a brief account of the greatairship invented by Count Zeppelin and called after his name It is saidthat the newest type of Zeppelin is about 700 feet long and haseighteen compartments which hold about a million cubic feet ofhydrogen Each compartment is a separate balloon and in theory theairship can remain afloat if two of the balloons are damaged Theframework is of wood and aluminium The engines guns stores and creware contained in two cars or gondolas which are built into theframework of the airship almost flush with its keel The engines arefour in number and drive the propellers a pair being coupled to eachcar two forward and two astern When they are working they make aterrible din and a Zeppelin thus advertises his approachSome of the latest vessels have a speed of from forty to sixty miles anhour Two sets of rudders are providedone set for steering the shiphorizontally and one set to guide it when ascending or descending Itcan ascend with remarkable speedit is said that a modern Zeppelin cansoar upwards at a speed of 4500 feet per minute and can reach thesafety zone of about 12000 feet almost before artillery on the groundhas secured the range A large Zeppelin can carry about seventeen tonsof which about two tons consist of explosives All Zeppelins are fittedwith powerful searchlights and a car which can be let down from thegondola by steel ropes so as to enable the men in it to makeobservations from a lower level The weakest part of a Zeppelin is itsupper envelope Attacking aeroplanes always endeavour to rise above theairship in order to drop bombs upon it You will remember that Warneforddestroyed his Zeppelin in this way[Illustration SubLieutenant Warneford bombing a Zeppelin in MidairBy permission of The GraphicA description of this exploit which won SubLieutenant Warneford theVictoria Cross is given on page 382]Before the war a Zeppelin had travelled 1800 miles on a single journeyand had remained in the air for thirtyfive hours at a stretch I havealready told you that the Germans had built great airship sheds on theisland of Heligoland From this base to Yarmouth on the east coast ofEngland is a distance of only 280 miles It was therefore clear thatgiven suitable weather a Zeppelin could not only cross the North Seaand return but could sail over large areas of Great Britain as wellThe Germans had long dreamed of making Zeppelin raids on London anddestroying it by means of big bombs but most people in this countrylaughed at the notion We pinned our faith to the aeroplane andbelieved the Zeppelin to be little more than an expensive failure Noreal efforts were therefore made to cope with the threatened danger Afew antiaircraft guns were stationed round the capital searchlightswere installed street lamps were obscured and windows were darkenedbut that was allOn the evening of January 19 1915 the people of Yarmouth were startledby the sound of loud explosions in their streets The Zeppelins had atlast arrived Bombs were dropped two persons were killed houses werewrecked and holes were blown in the streets The raiders then flew toSandringham and Kings Lynn at both of which places bombs were droppedHappily the King and Queen had left their Norfolk home for London on theprevious morning At Kings Lynn four houses were destroyed severalothers were damaged and the widow of a soldier and a boy of fourteenwere killed People stood aghast at this new form of Germanfrightfulness It was directed not against fortresses or places ofmilitary importance but against peaceful civilians in open unprotectedtowns It was sheer murder and was intended to terrorize the Britishpeople and bring them to their knees The Germans have never been ableto understand our national temper They had still to learn that suchblows only weld us the more firmly together and steel us to greaterresistance Every Zeppelin raid brought flocks of fresh recruits to ourbannersA month later a German aeroplane appeared over the Essex coast anddropped bombs on and near Colchester but no lives were lost The summerair campaign began in earnest on 14th April when airships appeared onTyneside and attempted to destroy the great shipbuilding yards Bombswere dropped but almost at random and very little damage was doneprobably because the pilot was out of his reckoning There were threeother raids on the East Coast in the same month but though houses werewrecked no lives were lost On 10th May Southend was attacked At thefirst alarm people left their beds and rushed into the streets halfdressed They could see the body of the Zeppelin outlined against thesky and the bombs falling like balls of fire Many houses weredestroyed and others blazed furiously but only one person waskilledthe wife of a labourer During the first nine months of the warthe results of the air raids must have been very disappointing to theGermans Half a dozen people had been killed a few had been injuredand damage to the extent of some hundred thousand pounds had been doneThe Germans were soon to improve on this record London has not felt ityet they saidA week later a Zeppelin passed over Ramsgate on which it dropped twodozen bombs happily without causing any loss of life and then overBroadstairs and Dover News of this raid had been sent to the station ofthe Royal Naval Air Service at Dunkirk and eight seaplanes at once setout to intercept the Zeppelin FlightCommander Bigsworth dropped fourbombs on the airship but it managed to get home though seriouslydamaged On 26th May there was another raid on Southend just as thepeople were leaving places of entertainment A lady visitor and a littlegirl seven years old were killed and others were gravely injuredThe first attack on London was made on the last day of May TheZeppelins passed over Colchester at ten oclock in the evening andtwentythree minutes later were dropping bomb after bomb on the mostcrowded part of the East End of London Six people were killed amongstthem a little girl of three who was burnt in her bed Many houses burstinto flames and a great deal of damage was done Earlier in the monthGerman tradesmen who had been allowed to remain and carry on businessin London had been mobbed now the people angered by the murderousraid attacked their shops and in many cases wrecked them In June theraiders once more visited the East and NorthEast Coast On 6th Junethey reached a town on the East Coast during the night and dropped manybombs on it A large drapery house was destroyed but a beautiful Normanchurch hard by escaped almost uninjured Twentyfour persons were killedand about sixty others seriously wounded during the attack The outragewas speedily avenged by Lieutenant Warneford who you will rememberdestroyed a Zeppelin in Belgium the next dayOn 15th June there was another raid on the NorthEast Coast A number ofworkmen ran out of their shops to see the Zeppelins and were caught bythe bomb explosions Some sixteen of them were killed while thirteenothers were injured Only one raid and that an unsuccessful one tookplace in July but in August there were three all of them on a largescale and all on the eastern counties On 9th August Zeppelins sweptover a large area and killed one man nine women and four childrenbesides wounding at least fourteen others One of the Zeppelins wasdamaged and on the homeward voyage was attacked and destroyed by ouraircraftOn the 12th the visit was repeated and three men eleven women andnine children fell victims to the bombs while many others were badlyinjured and numerous houses were wrecked One bomb fell into the middleof a little crowd of old men women and young children standing at astreet corner in a little country town and worked frightful havocThough the Zeppelins were attacked by antiaircraft guns they succeededin escaping The third raid was on 17th August when ten persons werekilled and thirtysix persons were injured including three children Inthis case too the Zeppelins came under the fire of our guns andperhaps as in the former case one of them was hitBy this time it was evident that we were without proper means of defenceagainst the enemy airships They could come and go almost at will andscatter death and destruction amongst us almost unchecked After everyraid the German newspapers published glowing accounts of the destructionwhich had been wrought One of them said We cannot rain bombs enoughon England Our Government had given us only the briefest accounts ofthe raids and people began to ask why they could not be told the wholetruth Mr Balfour said that it was necessary to keep the Germans inignorance of what they had done and it would be folly to give theminformation which would help them on future voyages Up to the end ofAugust he told us no soldier or sailor had been killed and only sevenhad been wounded Only on one occasion had damage of military importancebeen doneRaids were made on London on the evenings of 7th and 8th September Onthe first night outlying districts were attacked and on the followingnight bombs were dropped in the very heart of the city The Zeppelinsarrived between ten and eleven oclock when the places of amusementwere open and the streets were full of people Suddenly the sound ofexplosion after explosion was heard An American writer thus describedthe scene    Traffic is at a standstill A million quiet cries make a    subdued roar Seven million people of the biggest city in the    world stand gazing into the sky from the darkened streets       Among the autumn stars floats a long gaunt Zeppelin It is dull    yellowthe colour of the harvest moon The long fingers of    searchlights reaching up from the roofs of the city are    touching all sides of the death messenger with their white tips    Great booming sounds shake the city They are Zeppelin    bombsfalling killing burning Lesser noisesof    shootingare nearer at hand the noise of aerial guns sending    shrapnel into the sky    If the men up there think they are    terrifying London they are wrong They are only making England    whitehot madMany people were killed great fires arose but no important publicbuilding was damaged The Germans reported that they had practicallywrecked London but though they had done mischief enough the resultfell very very far short of their boastful claims Shortly afterwardsAdmiral Sir Percy Scott was placed in charge of the air defences of thecapitalThere were four raids on the East Coast in September and on 13thOctober London and parts of the eastern counties were again attacked InLondon alone thirtytwo persons were killed and ninetyfive injured andthe total casualties of that night were fiftysix killed and one hundredand thirteen wounded A cry now arose that our aircraft should treatGerman towns to a dose of their own medicine but there were many whobelieved that we ought not to repay evil for evil and that reprisalswould not bring the war any nearer to its closeThe October raid was the last which took place during the year 1915 Ontwenty several occasions during that year the Zeppelins had paid visitsto various parts of the East Coast of England They had murdered nofewer than 199 people and had inflicted injuries upon 421 others  CHAPTER L  THE OVERRUNNING OF SERBIADecember 1914 saw Serbia gloriously victorious December 1915 saw herplunged in hopeless defeat the remnants of her army on alien soil herpeople in bondage her aged king a fugitive Since that August day whenthe Austrians let slip the dogs of war her peasant soldiers had foughtlike heroes Thrice had Serbia been invaded and thrice had she flungback the invader but every success had drained her of lifeblood andhad brought the hour of her downfall nearer She must have lost 150000men in action and disease and pestilence had robbed her of another50000 The Serbian army was now only 200000 strong and there was nopossible hope of increasing it The Allies could not spare herreinforcements nor did she ask for them She felt that she could stillhold her own and perhaps she might have done so had not a neighbouringnation treacherously joined the enemy and flung a large andwellequipped army upon her flankSerbias eastern neighbour is Bulgaria I have already told you thatBulgaria owes her very existence to Russia In 1878 when the Russianswere nearing Constantinople they agreed to a treaty by which theprovince of Bulgaria was to be formed into a new state In the next yearthe Bulgarians elected a German prince as their sovereign but hisattempts to increase his territory brought about a quarrel with Russiaand in 1886 he was forced to give up the throne and leave the country Anew prince was electedanother German Ferdinand of SaxeCoburgGothaIn 1908 Ferdinand declared Bulgaria an independent kingdom and becameits first kingOn page 313 I told you that just before the fall of Brest the Germansprepared to force a road from Austria to the Bosphorus What was theobject of this new move The Germans were in much the same position asthe British and French they were cut off from their Allies by hostilecountry As you know we undertook the illstarred expedition toGallipoli in order to open up communication between the Western Alliesand Russia The Central Powers were now about to invade Serbia in orderto open up communication between Austria and Bulgaria and Turkey Ifthey could get into touch with these Balkan Powers they could provideTurkey with munitions and supplies they could send reinforcements intoGallipoli and generally direct the operations of the Bulgarians and theTurks Further they could secure a right of way into Asia Minor whichwould enable them to attack Egypt and perhaps advance to the PersianGulf and threaten India It was also hoped that new supplies of foodcotton metals and men would be tappedLook carefully at the map on page 393 Follow the main railway linewhich runs from the Austrian town of Semlin on the Danube throughBelgrade Nish and Sophia the capital of Bulgaria to ConstantinopleIf the Central Powers could capture this railway they would secure athrough route from Germany to the shores of the Bosphorus The whole aimand object of the invasion which I am about to describe was to getpossession of this railwayWhat was the plan of campaign Von Gallwitz with the great artilleryengine which had driven the Russians back from Galicia into the marshesof the Pripet was to cross the Danube between Orsova on the Rumanianborder and Belgrade and blast his way through the triangle of countrybetween the railway and the Bulgarian frontier At the same time theAustrians were to strike south to the west of Belgrade and while thesetwo movements were in progress Bulgaria was to fall upon Serbia from theeast The little Serbian army was to be taken in front and in flank atnine different points by forces which outnumbered it by at least threeto one The invaders were furnished with huge guns and vast supplies ofammunition against which the Serbians could not hope to stand Themoment that the blow was launched the fate of Serbia was sealed[Illustration Map to illustrate the Campaign in Serbia]In 1897 Bulgaria proposed to form a league uniting Greece and the BalkanStates against Turkey and in 1912 the league was formed Shortlyafterwards the First Balkan War began Turkey was badly beaten and muchterritory was taken from her but when the time came for dividing upthe booty the victors fell out and fought amongst themselves Greece andSerbia took the field against Bulgaria and overcame her Ever sincethat time Bulgaria bitterly hated Serbia Her king Ferdinand was avain and cunning man without a spark of personal courage but with akeen eye for the main chance and with no scruples to prevent him fromseizing it During the present war he watched and waited and bided histime When he saw the Russians retreating day after day and the Britishand French making no progress in Gallipoli or in the West he felt surethat Germany would win He was a German himself and he was nowprepared to range himself with the Central Powersat a price On 17thJuly he signed a treaty by which as a reward for joining the twoKaisers he was to receive Serbian Macedonia Salonika[80] and someGreek territory All August and September he was busy making hispreparations and by the beginning of October he was ready to obey hismasters orders and fall upon SerbiaWhy did not the Allies hasten to the defence of threatened SerbiaThereby hangs a tale On 11th September the Greek Premier whobelieved that his country ought to stand by its treaty with Serbia andenter the fray asked France and Britain for 150000 troops About afortnight later the Allies agreed to furnish these troops and the Greekarmy began to mobilize Ferdinand had already called up his armies buthe told the world that he had only done so for the purpose ofselfdefence and that he had no intention of making war on hisneighbours Serbia however knew better and towards the end ofSeptember she informed the British that she was not going to wait untilthe Bulgarians were fully prepared but was about to attack them atonce The British Government persuaded her not to do so because itstill had hopes that Bulgaria might be persuaded to stay her hand Youwill soon learn that Serbia by taking the advice of the BritishGovernment suffered terriblyBy agreement with the Greek Premier the Allies began to land troops atthe Greek port of Salonika in the first week of October The Greeksobjected but did not hinder us indeed they helped our army to occupythe place Then came a remarkable change of front on the part of theGreek king He had married the Kaisers sister and he went in fear ofhis brotherinlaw Probably he believed that Germany was going to winhe knew that Bulgaria was strong and Serbia weak and that the 150000troops of the Allies could not turn the balance in his favour So heinformed his Prime Minister that he had never consented to fight onbehalf of Serbia whereupon the Prime Minister resigned and a newGovernment was formed It declared that Greece meant to remain neutralthough it was very friendly to the AlliesWhile our transports were crowding the harbour at Salonika and theAllies were busy putting the place into a state of defence Ferdinandthrew off the mask A week later on 12th October when his advanceguards were over the border he declared war on Serbia Four days laterBritain declared war upon Bulgaria Von Mackensen had already crossedthe Danube and was pressing against the Serbian front with 200000 mena quarter of a million Bulgarians were moving eastwards against theexposed right flank of Serbia and in Salonika there were 13000 Frenchand British troops preparing to march inland against the Bulgarian leftSuch was the position of affairs on 15th October                           Now let us return to the Danube and briefly follow the stages ofSerbias agony By means of the great river which is linked with thecanals of the Elbe and the Rhine barges full of big guns and supplieshad been conveyed to the scene of action On 19th September before thebig guns arrived Austrian batteries opened fire on Belgrade but theSerbians and the British sailors who were fighting with them prevented acrossing On 3rd October the enemys big guns were placed in positionand the Serbian trenches were pounded to dust It was the Donajetzbombardment all over again Belgrade could no longer be held and by the8th of October the Austrians and Germans had crossed the Danube and theSave at six places between Shabatz and Belgrade There was a desperatestruggle in the streets of the capital but on the morning of the 9ththe place was in the enemys hands The lesson of Warsaw had beenlearned and all that was valuable in the city had been carried offBy 11th October the AustroGermans held a hundred miles of front on thesouth banks of the Save and the Danube The Serbians had foughtdesperately but they could not stand before the mass of artillerybrought against them The Serbian left had been forced back towards thehills on which it had made its first stand against the third Austrianinvasion the centre had fallen back to a ridge seven miles south of thecapital and the right was being harried across the river plain and upthe valleys of the Morava and the Mlava On the Serbian right Mackensenmoved his big guns slowly He was waiting for the Bulgarians to take theSerbians in flank and in rear On the 12th the Bulgarians attacked theSerbians at five different points and it was clear that if theSerbians were to avoid being completely surrounded they must retreatas the Russians had done But unlike the Russians they had no vastland into which they could retire Their only line of withdrawal lay tothe west and southwest into the bare rugged highlands of Montenegroand the wilderness of AlbaniaThe French and British in the south were by this time strugglingnorthwards in the attempt to reach Uskub the great meetingplace of allroutes in Southern Serbia They were however too late the Bulgariansentered Uskub on 22nd October and the Allies were thus cut off from allcommunication with the interiorThe Serbians were now in a desperate plight Along every road and trackleft open to the southwest thousands of old men women and childrentrudged wearily onward bearing with them the few household goods whichthey could carry off Food was scarce carts could not be obtained forlove or money and on the desolate hills thousands of wretched peasantsperished of cold and hunger By 26th October the whole northeast cornerof Serbia was in the hands of the enemy The Serbian army which laybetween the Drina and Nish was cut off from that which lay in the shapeof a halfmoon in front of the southern Bulgarian army There was nomore fighting for the northern army it was slowly but surely beingenclosed and was now in full retreat along the valley of the river Ibaron the road to Montenegro Meanwhile the southern army made a lastdespairing effort to stem the Bulgarian advance in the passes betweenPrisrend and Monastir and having failed retreated into AlbaniaLook at the railway line running from Uskub to Mitrovitza and find thepass of Katchanik If the northern army was to get away safely intoMontenegro the Bulgarians must be prevented from pushing to their rearand swinging to the north to cut off the retreat It was thereforenecessary to hold the enemy at Katchanik Pass Five thousand men allthat was left of the garrison at Uskub along with three regiments fromthe north now prepared to make a stand Their guns were on the heightsand they had sufficient ammunition for a battle of several days TheBulgarians advanced on a fifteenmile front but the Serbian guns drovethem back On the third day the Serbians attacked with bombs and thebayonet All night the desperate struggle continued and after twelvehours fighting the Bulgarian line was pierced But the enemy inoverwhelming strength formed up behind the gap and began to enclose thelittle Serbian force It fell back fighting and joined the retreatingnorthern army But it had done its workthe danger of disaster wasoverAnother stand was made at the Babuna Pass which you will see on themap about fifty miles south of Katchanik Pass You will notice from themap that if the Bulgarians could get to Prilep no supplies could reachthe Serbians from the south If too the Allies could retake the townof Veles[81] Uskub would be threatened and the Bulgarians would not beable to follow up the northern army In the first days of November some5000 Serbians actually held the crest of the Babuna Pass for more thana week The Allies however could make no headway from the south andthe gallant rearguard finding six divisions of the enemy before it wasforced to fall back into Albania                           What of the Allies in Salonika On 12th October General Sarrail arrivedto take command of the French 2nd Division which had been brought fromCape Helles Before our 10th Division from Suvla was ready to move theFrench moved up country in the hope of joining hands with the Serbiansin the neighbourhood of Uskub You will see on the map a railway runningup the Vardar to Veles Along this railway Sarrail moved his troops Itwas a single grassgrown track quite inadequate for the advance of anarmy Ninety miles north of Salonika at a point marked X on the map itbegins to run through a narrow gorge with steep rocky walls called theIron Gate If the Bulgarians once gained this ravine the Allies wouldbe held up and unable to advance Early in the month of OctoberBulgarian raiders cut the railway at X but on the 19th the Frenchadvance guards reached the place and drove them out Four days later therest of the division arrived and detachments which were ferried acrossthe Vardar seized positions on the left bank of the river which wasthen swollen by the autumn rains Meanwhile the British 10th Divisionextended the French right to Lake Doiran It was now proposed to capturea steep wall of mountain which commanded the valley In order to reachit the French left had to cross the swollen river once more It had nopontoons but by means of an old ferryboat a detachment got across TheFrench scaled the summit drove off the Bulgarians who held it and dugthemselves in On 4th and 5th November the Bulgarians made a strongattack on the summit but were repulsed after fierce fighting at closequartersNow that the French commanded the valley southward they began to pushon towards the Babuna Pass in order to join hands with the Serbians whowere holding the crest By the time they were within ten miles of theSerbian position the Bulgarians were flinging 125000 men against theheroic rearguard The French dared not proceed further Supplies couldonly reach them along a hundred miles of singleline railway whichmight be cut any day their only means of crossing the Vardar was by acrazy wooden bridge and there were twenty miles of bad road in theirrear The Serbians had already retreated from the Babuna Pass and anadvance could be of no service to them Further the Bulgarians weretrying to cut them off from the bridge They were therefore obliged toretreat no other course was open to them The Allied endeavour had cometo nothing The French and British fell back on Salonika and thereremained throughout the winter[Illustration Remote unfriended melancholy slowFrom the picture by F Matania By permission of the SphereThis picture shows old King Peter and his court retreating on footthrough the snows of winter into the wilds of Albania]In those November days heartrending scenes were witnessed on the Serbianhills now white with the first snows of winter Fugitives in ox wagonsin country carts and on foot men women and little children throngedthe roadsa long procession of woe The army which a year ago hadflung the Austrians out of the country was now a mere remnant of150000 famished and weary men With it marched our British NavalBrigade and its guns The devoted doctors and nurses who had for ninemonths been ministering to the wounded and diseased were scattered farand wide By roundabout roads some of them reached the Allies atSalonika others gained the Adriatic coast and some such as LadyPaget remained and trusted to the tender mercies of the BulgariansRetreating with the army were the officials of the Court and theGovernment Perhaps the most pathetic figure of all was the SerbianKing racked by rheumatism and sore of heart because his age andinfirmities prevented him from fighting in the ranks with his heroicpeople But behind all his sorrows there was a ray of hope His armythough but a remnant was still an army and not a broken and dispiritedmob It would live to fight again                           So for the Allies the year 1915 closed in gloom A visitor from Marspresented with a map of the German conquests might have been pardonedhad he proclaimed the two Kaisers victorious From the Yser to theDvina from the Baltic to the Bosphorus and thence to the Tigris theyand their fellowconspirators were masters of 177000000 people Theyhad driven the Russians before them they had made another Belgium ofSerbia the French and British had failed in their Eastern enterprisesand could not break through in the West The Germans loudly boasted oftheir triumph but to their amazement there was no sign ofwarweariness or faintheartedness amongst the Allies Conscious thatthe enemy had passed the first flush of his mighty strength the Alliesendured the heaviness of the night and while waiting for the morning        Never doubted clouds would break  Never dreamed though right were worsted wrong would triumph  Held we fall to rise are baffled to fight better              Sleep to wake[Footnote 80 Salonka port of Greece on the gulf of the same
