on the 28th March 1918 the 56th London TerritorialDivision was in position on the southern portion of the Vimy Ridge Atnightfall the division still held its ground having beaten back threeseparate assaults delivered in great strength by picked German troopsspecially trained in the attack and inspired with confidence resultingfrom the successes of the previous week Truly a great achievementand important as great for the Vimy Ridge covered the city of Arrasand the coalfields of BthuneImportant as this success was held to be at the time a time of greatstrain upon the forces of the Empire it was not till later on whenLudendorff took us into his confidence that we learned its fullsignificance Ludendorff gives us to understand that the failure ofthe German effort of 28th March constituted the turningpoint of the1918 campaign That evening Ludendorff recognised the beginning of theend the German nation lost heart the moral of the German Armydeteriorated rapidlyI have selected the aboveone of the many achievements of the 56thLondon Territorial Divisionto illustrate the stage of efficiency towhich the troops of our Territorial Army had attained in warI saw much of our Territorial troops in France I had seen somethingof them in prewar days and I recall an absence of appreciation ofthe devotion of those whose patriotic enthusiasm put life into thegreat organisation evolved from the brain of a statesman to whomhistory will give the credit hitherto unworthily begrudged to LordHaldaneI take this opportunity of paying my tribute of respect and admirationto the Territorial Army as a whole and the 56th London Division inparticularThis note would not be complete without reference to that finesoldier the late MajorGen Sir Amyatt Hull whose professionalqualities and personal charm gained the respect and affection of allranks and who imbued with his own unconquerable spirit the officersand men of the division which he commanded so long and of which hewas so

 CHAPTER I         FORMATION AND THE ATTACK ON THE GOMMECOURT SALIENTAfter the declaration of war when the first news of the ExpeditionaryForce began to trickle across the Channel the people of England weretold that troops were marching to the lilting tune with the Cockneyrefrain     Goodbye Piccadilly       Farewell Leicester Square     Its a long long way to Tipperary       But my hearts right thereWithin a few months territorial battalions were marching in France andsinging the same absurd song But the London the Cockney spiritimpudent noisy but goodtempered and friendly always wide awakeobservant and ready for a scrap above all never downhearted ledthe way from the very beginning of the war It is with thelighthearted crowd of Piccadilly and Leicester Square that we areconcerned for the whole of London some time or other passes throughthose thoroughfares                                         There is something peculiarly fascinating in following the fortunes ofLondon troops particularly Territorial troopsFor some reason there has been a tendency of late years to look down       2on the men of London to dismiss them as weaklings as men of poorphysique with maybe smart tongues and clothes but without thenecessary stamina for hardy soldiers It would be difficult to say onwhat ground such an opinion was based At least it has no historicalfoundation The Trained Bands of London have a very definite place inthe history of EnglandAlthough it is not the oldest corps the Artillery Company of Londonformed to train men in the use of the long bow cross bow and handgun dates back to the time of Henry VIII Westminster and the Countyof Middlesex were ever to the fore in raising Volunteers as distinctfrom the Militia though the distinction was not always too clear StGeorges Hanover SquarePimlicoInns of CourtBloomsburyStJamess are names to be found in every record of effort to meet anational danger Enfield Tottenham Stoke Newington ChelseaKensington Chiswick Battersea Clapham Clerkenwell DeptfordHungerford Islington Lambeth and Wandsworth have all raisedcompanies for the defence of England in former times of stressThere is no need to labour the point Every student of the history ofthe British Army knows what the Service owes to London The Londonerhas always proved himself a valiant soldier and has not withheld fromenlistmentWhat England owes to the Territorial is above computation As thedescendant of the old Volunteer he was enrolled to serve in Englandalone But when war with the Central Powers was declared he did nothesitatehis response was immediate and unanimous Territorials           3landed in France in 1914 and continued to arrive in that country in asteady stream as they could be spared from Great BritainWhen the 56th Division was assembled in France during the first daysof February 1916 it was not therefore a new unit looking aboutwith wondering eyes at new scenes and standing as it were on thetiptoes of expectation as it paused on the outskirts of the greatadventure The twelve battalions of infantry were veterans[1]On the 5th February MajorGen C P A Hull to whom command of thenew division was given arrived at Hallencourt between Abbeville andAmiens where his staff was to meet     LieutCol J E S Brind       GSO1     Major A E G Bayley            GSO2     Capt T W Bullock              GSO3     Bt LieutCol H

been available at first         4arrived at last Rain whole day Could anything be more tragicOur sympathies are entirely with the staff on these occasions forthough the situation cannot be described as chaotic it isbewildering Troops were arriving from all directions and at all timesof the day the machinery was not in running order and its creakingwheels which occasionally stopped necessitated the most carefulwatching and a great deal of work When an organisation is being madeno one can say that is not my job for it seems as though all jobsare his for the time being The Interpreter would have been mostuseful if only to arrange the billetingand what is a staff officerwithout stationeryThe Brigades were as followsThe 167th Infantry Brigade commanded by BrigGen F HBurnellNugent with Capt

London RegtQueens Westminster RiflesIt is not easy to keep the brigade groupings in mind at thisstagearrangements were recast and designations were changed The11st London Bde RFA the 21st London Field Coy RE the21st London Field Ambulance were posted to the 167th Brigade The12nd London Bde RFA the 22nd London Field Coy RE and the22nd London Field Ambulance were posted to the 168th Brigade The13rd London Bde RFA and the 23rd London Field Ambulance to the169th Brigade But we find that subsequent changes result in     the 11st London Bde RFA becoming 280th Bde RFA     the 12nd London Bde RFA becoming 281st Bde RFA     the 13rd London Bde RFA becoming 282nd Bde RFAand a newlyformed 18pounder brigade the 283rd Bde RFA Also thetwo field companies of the Royal Engineers become known as the 512thand 513th Field Companies and were joined by the 416th EdinburghField Coy which was posted to the 169th Infantry BrigadeAnd the Royal Army Service Corps which appears at first as numbers 12 3 and 4 Companies become the 213th with the 214th 215th and216th posted to the three infantry brigades in numerical orderThe Stokes trench mortar batteries were numbered 167th 168th and169th the medium trench mortar batteries as X Y and Z They wereposted in numerical or alphabetical order to the infantry brigades        6There was also a heavy trench mortar battery designated V Batterywhich was formed in May 1916The pioneer battalion was the 15th Battalion Cheshire Regt Theveterinary unit was the 11st London Mobile Veterinary SectionThese were the bits of machinery forming the 56th DivisionThe first divisional conference was held on the 11th February whenmost of the officers attending had their first introduction to GenHull He was a tall goodlooking man with an abrupt manner but ofsingular charm It did not take him long to win the completeconfidence of his divisionIn the midst of the work of getting the machine properly fittedtogether there were the usual rumours and warning orders which cameto nothing The first information Gen Hull received was that the VICorps of which his division formed a part would relieve the XVIIFrench Corps and would move to the area DomartenPonthieu The movetook place on the 27th February in the midst of a heavy fall of snowwhich made the roads very heavy for transport And a further move wasmade on the 12th March to the Doullens area between that town and StPolWhenever units were behind the line they trained It did not matterhow long the individual soldier had been in France and Belgium he wasnever excused as a fully trained soldier Even instructors were sentfrom time to time to receive fresh instruction at Divisional Corpsor Army schools And so during the period of assembly the units ofthe 56th Division trained Some were attached for ten days or a            7fortnight to the 14th Division for work in a forward position roundabout Dainvilleinfantry artillery engineers and field ambulancetook their turn at this work others carried on the routine ofexercise on the traininggrounds in the neighbourhood of theirbillets The CommanderinChief Sir Douglas Haig visited thedivisional area and the school at Givenchy on the 30th MarchIn studying the adventures of a division whether it is holding theline or whether it is in a reserve area one must always visualise agreat deal more than the twelve battalions of infantry which make orrepel the final charge in any engagement A division occupies andworks over a large area and depends of course on a base ofsupplies When a person is told of the front taken up by a divisionhe will look at the map and measure off the width of the front lineThere he says is the division But the division covers quite abig area in depth as well Not only do the billets of troops notactually employed in the front line go back a long way in successivestages but the wagons and lorries of the Royal Army Service Corpswork back many miles The narrowest measurement of a divisional areais usually the front linePerhaps the following list showing the dispositions of the divisionin billets during March will give those with no experience some ideaof what is meant by the word

these units contribute to an advance Some designation such asshops may strike the ear as strange an unlikely unit to help muchin an advance but a man cannot march without boots a gun can neithershoot

May the CRA BrigGen R J C Elkington took overartillery positions from the CRA 14th Division on the Hbuternefront                                         Three months had elapsed since the division had commenced to assembleat Hallencourt Troops were well rested and trained and were now tobe launched in the big operations of 1916 It would be as well at thispoint to note the general situation as from now on the 56th Divisiontook a prominent part in the severe fighting which commenced on 1stJulyWe will give the German point of view as expressed by Gen vonFalkenhayn and published in his war book[2]     France has been weakened almost to the limits of endurance     both in a military and economic sensethe latter by the     permanent loss of the coalfields in the northeast of the     country The Russian armies have not been completely     overthrown but their offensive powers have been so     shattered that she can never revive in anything like her             11     old strength The armies of Serbia can be considered as     destroyed Italy has no doubt realised that she cannot     reckon on the realisation of her brigands ambitions within     measurable time and would therefore probably be only too     glad to be able to liquidate her adventure in any way that     would save her face     If no deductions can be drawn from these facts the reasons     are to be sought in many circumstances  the chief among     them cannot be passed over for it is the enormous hold     which England still has on her alliesHe then goes on to discuss what can be done to break the will ofEngland He says that the history of the English wars against theNetherlands Spain France and Napoleon is being repeated ThatEngland is obviously staking everything on a war of exhaustion Heputs the winter of 1917 as the latest date when a food crisis and thesocial and political crisis that always follow them among the membersof our alliance will occur and asks or rather states that Englandmust be shown that her venture has no prospects But in this case ofcourse as in most others involving higher strategic decisions it isvery much easier to say what has to be done than to find out how itcan and must be doneHow can one inflict a decisive defeat on England on land Invasion isimpossiblethe German Navy is convinced of that     As far as our own Continent of Europe is concerned we are     sure of our troops and are working with known factors For     that reason we must rule out enterprises in the East where     England can only be struck at indirectly Victories at               12     Salonica the Suez Canal or in Mesopotamia can only help us     in so far as they intensify the doubts about Englands     invulnerability which have already been aroused among the     Mediterranean peoples and in the Mohammedan world Defeats     in the East could do us palpable harm among our allies We     can in no case expect to do anything of decisive effect on     the course of the war as the protagonists of an Alexander     march to India or Egypt or an overwhelming blow at     Salonica are always hoping Our allies have not the     necessary means at their disposal We are not in a position     to supply them owing to the bad communications and     England which has known how to swallow the humiliations of     Antwerp and Gallipoli will survive defeats in those distant     theatres also     When we turn from them to the European theatre where     England can be struck on land we cannot close our eyes to     the fact that we are faced with an extraordinarily difficult     problemIt would seem that England was giving poor von Falkenhayn a lot oftrouble After looking vainly in the East for a vulnerable point inher armour he is forced to turn his eyes to the West And in the Westhe does not like the look of the British Army He cannot collect morethan twentyfive or twentysix divisions to attack with and they arenot nearly enough     Attempts at a mass breakthrough even with an extreme     accumulation of men and material cannot be regarded as     holding out prospects of success against a wellarmed enemy     whose moral is sound and who is not seriously inferior in     numbers The defender has usually succeeded in closing the     gaps The salients thus made enormously exposed to the     effects of flanking fire threaten to become a mere                  13     slaughterhouse The technical difficulties of directing and     supplying the masses bottled up in them are so great as to     seem practically insurmountableHe sweeps aside the idea of attacking the English Army with a finalcomplaint that even if he drove it completely from the ContinentEngland may be trusted not to give up even then and France wouldnot have been very seriously damaged so that a second operation wouldhave to be taken against her It would be impossible to get sufficientmenEnglands allies are called her tools and the only thing to do isto smash up the tools But no weapon is to be discarded and sounrestricted submarine warfare must be undertaken against thisarchenemy     If the definite promises of the Naval Authorities that the     unrestricted submarine war must force England to yield in     the course of the year 1916 are realised we must face the     fact that the United States may take up a hostile attitude     She cannot intervene decisively in the war in time to enable     her to make England fight on when that country sees the     spectre of hunger and many another famine rise up before her     island There is only one shadow on this encouraging picture     of the future We have to assume that the Naval Authorities     are not making a mistakeAs for the tools Italy is ruled out as a possible one to be brokenas she is not of much account in Falkenhayns opinion and he thinksthere will soon be internal troubles Russia is also ruled out becausehe does not see any gain in the capture of Petrograd or Moscow and       14there are also internal troubles There is France left     As I have already insisted the strain on France has almost     reached the breakingpointthough it is certainly borne     with the most remarkable devotion If we succeed in opening     the eyes of her people to the fact that in a military sense     they have nothing more to hope for that breakingpoint     would be reached and Englands best sword knocked out of her     hand Within our reach behind the French sector of the     Western Front there are objectives for the retention of     which the French Staff would be compelled to throw in every     man they have If they do so the forces of France will bleed     to death The objectives of which I am speaking now are     Belfort and VerdunAltogether this document which was prepared for the Kaiser and musthave been read by that potentate with mixed feelings was not the workof an optimist It reads more like despair as though Falkenhayn wassaying I can still fight I can still hurt but I am bound to godown in the end One cannot see any very shrewd reasoning in it forhe not only underrated the valour of the French as the Germans alwaysdid but he was placed in very serious difficulties by the successfulattack of Brussiloff on the Austrians in June so that he alsoundervalued the strength of Russia For this misfortune however theGermans blame the Austrians condemning them for their offensiveagainst the Italians in May which was undertaken against Germanadvice and made the Brussiloff adventure possible But this documentshows the policy and plans of Germany for the year 1916the greatGerman effort on Verdun which was to bleed France to death dominatesall other events The attack was launched on the 21st February and        15coincides with the formation of the 56th Division and the subsequentmovements of the division were connected with the widespreadinginfluence of the Verdun battleIn his dispatch dated the 29th May Sir Douglas Haig sums up the earlysituation very briefly Since the 19th December 1915     the only offensive effort made by the enemy on a great     scale was directed against our French Allies near Verdun     The fighting in that area has been prolonged and severe The     results have been worthy of the highest traditions of the     French Army and of great service to the cause of the Allies     The efforts made by the enemy have cost him heavy losses     both in men and in prestige and he has made these     sacrifices without gaining any advantage to counterbalance     them     During the struggle my troops have been in readiness to     cooperate as they might be needed but the only assistance     asked for by our Allies was of an indirect natureviz the     relief of the French troops on a portion of their defensive     front This relief I was glad to be able to affordOn the other hand plans for a FrancoBritish offensive had been fullydiscussed by Sir Douglas Haig and Marshal Joffre and completeagreement arrived at Vast preparations were in progress Sir DouglasHaig desired to postpone the attack as long as possible because boththe British Army and the supply of ammunition were growing steadilyand time would enable the newer troops to complete their training Butthough the original plans had no connection with Verdun they werebound to influence and be influenced by the great German attackIt may be said that the Entente Powers were not looking for a speedy      16termination of the war but were bent on inflicting heavy blows onGermany and her allies while Germany was seeking by a concentrationon France at Verdun to gain a decision in the West Falkenhaynsadvice was being followed although the unrestricted submarine warfarewas postponed for the time beingThe plan for the British offensive was that the main attack should bedelivered by the Fourth Army under Sir Henry Rawlinson on a frontstretching from Maricourt on the right to Serre on the left whilefarther north the Third Army under Sir E H H Allenby would makean attack on both sides of the Gommecourt salientFor an offensive on this scale enormous preparations were necessaryThere was no end to the amount of stores to be accumulated fromammunition to horseshoes In the forward trench system many miles oftrenches had to be dugassault trenches assembly trenchescommunication trenches trenches for telephone wiresdugouts had tobe constructed for sheltering troops for dressingstations forstoring food water and engineering material not forgettingammunition We are bound to admit however that in those daysalthough much work was done on dugouts the infantry saw preciouslittle of them Mining they saw indeed but dugouts were rareThen there were dumps to be made at convenient points and many milesof railway line both standard and narrow gauge to bring the storeswithin reach of the fighting troops Roads had to be constructed andin some places causeways had to be built over marshy valleys Wellswere sunk over a hundred pumping stations were installed and a          17hundred and twenty miles of watermains laidThe whole country behind this vast front was teeming with men andhorses with wagons and motor lorries At night it was as though anarmy of gigantic ants were at work stretched out in long linesbuilding and excavating marching in solemn silent processions withgrim determined purpose in the slowness of their gait and bowed downunder loads of material They passed and repassed in neverendingstreams the roads were congested with motor and wagon traffic pathsacross the open country could be traced by the shadowy silhouettes ofmen in single file And the horizon flickered with the flash of gunsas with summer lightning while shells passed overhead with alongdrawn ghostly wail or fell with a sharp swish and a crash Theline that maze of foul mudfilled ditches constructed in a belt ofshellpounded and festering earth was indicated at night by floatingstarlights rising irregularly as sparks bursting into brilliancy andremaining for a moment suspended in the blackness of the sky like arclamps then dying once more to so many sparks before they fell to thegroundSometimes the nights would be quietthat is to say quiet except foroccasional crashes at intervals of several minutesalthough theconstant flickering on the horizon would never cease at others theywould be lively one might almost say there would be a sensation ofhustle so swift would be the wailing passage and so continuous thecrash of bursting shells This might last all through the night as anorganised shoot or would come suddenly without warning a swiftartillery attack on roads working parties or billetswhat was          18afterwards known as harassing fire though it was in a more intenseformand shifting from one point to another from front line toroads from roads to billets from billets to some spot where troopswere suspected to be working Or there would be a raid with an angryconcentration of artillery from both sidesAnd night after night the preparation for the Big Push went on                                         The 56th Division now trained and shaken together arrived in theHbuterne sector on the right of the Gommecourt salient and towardsthe left of the front under preparation for the British effort The167th Brigade took over the frontline system held by the 145thBrigade 48th Division on the 4th May The 168th Brigade marched fromtheir billets in the Doullens area on the 6th and the 169th Brigadefollowed on the 7th May Divisional Headquarters were established atHnuFirst blood was drawn for the division by the 167th Brigade on the18th May A German patrol attempted to bomb a sap held by the 3rdLondon Regt and was beaten off with the loss of one officer and oneNCO killed These proved to be of the 169th Infantry Regt 52ndDivision one of the divisions of the XIV German Corps and a normalidentificationThe system of holding the line was one of grouping On the 22nd MayBrigGen Coke 169th Brigade was in command of the line which washeld by two battalions of the 169th Brigade and two battalions of the168th Brigade In support was BrigGen Nugent with his headquartersat Souastre having under his command his own four battalions and one     19of the 169th Brigade BrigGen Loch 168th Brigade with hisheadquarters at Grenas had two of his own battalions and one of the169th BrigadePlans were now in preparation for a very remarkable achievementWe have seen that the scheme for the big British offensive included anattack on the Gommecourt salient This was to be undertaken by theThird Army and the task fell to the VII Corps Gen Snow holdingthe front in question For the moment we will confine ourselves to thepoint that the 56th Division was to be one of the attacking divisionsWhen Gen Hull was informed of what he was expected to do he was atonce confronted with an obvious difficultythe front line of hissector was some seven hundred yards away from the enemy It was notimpossible to shorten this distance but with one exception theseveral ways of doing it must result in heavy casualties the enemywould be bound to see what was afoot and would try by every means inhis power to prevent and to hinder its execution and render it ascostly as he could It would also be a lengthy business unless it wasboldly tackled Gen Hull decided on the boldest of all coursesHe traced out a new line which was on an average four hundred yardsin advance of the old one This meant working in some spots withintwo hundred and fifty yards of the enemy And he decided to dig itin one night It meant that at least three thousand yards oftrench must be constructed in a few hours a task of appallingmagnitude and it must be remembered that every effort was always madeto limit the number of men in any working party required for No Mans     20Land When he announced his intentions there was something likeconsternation at Corps HeadquartersThe task was allotted to BrigGen Nugent and the 167th Brigade Hehad at his disposal over and above the five battalions of hisgroup one company of the 5th Cheshire Regt with a half of the22nd London Field Coy RESo that the men might know the lie of the land the 167th Brigade wassent on ahead of the rest of the division and straight into the linewhich it held for a fortnight The Engineers the company officers ofbattalions concerned and the brigade staff made most carefulreconnaissance patrolling every night noting landmarks gettingacquainted with that silent eerie tract separating the two lines ofcombatants Conversations throughout the day were punctuated withreferences to the strong point the lonely tree the May bushthe Z hedge the head of Sap 4 as landmarks became familiarSometimes German patrols were met sometimes imaginedIt was decided to divide the whole front into four sectionsA B Cand D The only difficulty was the junction between B and C but thiswas eventually marked by a heap of white stonesa small heapFour days before the date fixed for the operation the brigade wasrelieved and during the following days the whole of the arrangementswere rehearsedwith the exception of the actual diggingfirst by dayand then by nightMeanwhile the artillery were warned that nothing was to be done bythem to rouse the enemy while the work was being carried out but that    21all batteries must be manned and ready for instant action All knownmachinegun emplacements were carefully registered and arrangementswere made with the BrigadierGeneral commanding the Corps heavyartillery to register on all German batteries whose zone of fireincluded the area of the work Two of the Divisional 45 howitzerswere to assist in the counterbattery workAlthough the trench was dug in one night the whole operation requiredthree nights to complete On the first night the 2526th Maycovering parties crept out and took up positions in advance of theselected line Then engineers followed quiet and certain in all thatthey did and marked out the line with string and pegs On the leftthey got to work speedily the pegs were about nine inches long andmade from small round stakes from which the bark had not been removedthe string was ordinary jute twine which had been prepared with loopsat the proper intervals to mark the angle of bays and traverses Theywere undisturbed and C and D sections were marked outBut in A and B sections the night was one of excursions and alarmsFirst of all there was great difficulty in getting the covering partythrough our own wire which suggests an unfortunate oversight andthen German patrols were encountered The latter occurrence was acontingency which had always been reckoned with A game of hide andseek ensued but meanwhile time passed There was no question ofclearing No Mans Land when other parties were working on the leftand so the marking had to be abandoned It did not however cause anyserious inconvenienceThe next night each battalion marched from billets fully armed for       22digging Ten per cent carried picks and the remainder carriedshovels which had been carefully sharpened Each man had threesandbags one being wrapped round the shovel or pick to prevent noiseand between them they also carried a quantity of white tapeIn the line ten exits had been made by cutting through our wire andconstructing steps out of the trenchtrench ladders had also beenprovided by the engineers in case the steps should be impassablethrough rain White boards were hung on the wire to mark these gapsfor the withdrawalThe communication trenches to be used by the working battalions wereleft quite clear by the troops holding the line and at the appointedtime the head of each battalion was at the selected entrance andadvanced in the following order covering parties taping partiesworking partiesThe covering parties consisting of sixty officers and men in sixgroups had orders to use rifle fire as sparingly as possible but tomake full use of the bayonet if enemy patrols were encounteredWhen the covering parties had been given time to get out the twoother groups of parties followed at short intervals And half an hourafter the digging parties had left the trench wiring and carryingparties about a hundred men to each battalion went out There werethree thousand men in No Mans LandThe boldness of Gen Hulls enterprise was amply justified By 230am the trench had been made and was held by posts found from thecovering parties reinforced with Lewis guns they had rations waterand shovels to improve their positions and were in telephonic            23communication with the old trench and all the working parties hadfiled away as silently as they had comeDuring the ensuing day the Royal Flying Corps successfully preventedany enemy aeroplanes from approaching our lines but our airmenphotographed the new line themselves and at noon Gen Hull was ableto see from a photograph what work had been doneOn the night of 2728th the same number of men were out working againimproving the frontline trench and wire digging support lines andtwo other communication trenches The new work had been pegged out theprevious night by the engineersThe 56th Division had then started its career with the astounding featof having in the space of fortyeight hours constructed and wired anew system of trenches comprising 2900 yards of fire trench and1500 yards of communication trenches in No Mans Land and within 250yards of the enemy Casualties were 8 killed and 55 wounded A littleluck had waited on audacity but the success of the whole operationwas undoubtedly due to the intelligence and keenness of the men Theyhad nothing much to help them Gen Hull had indeed ordered two orthree wagons loaded with empty shellcases and biscuit tins to driveup and down the roads in rear of his lines and the artillery fired anoccasional round from a howitzer as a means of distracting theattention of the enemy but it only required one foolish man to losehis head and disaster would have descended on the whole brigadeIt is interesting to note the dress The covering parties were in fullfighting kit and carried one days ration the taping digging and       24wiring men had no equipment but carried a rifle loaded with tenrounds and one bandolier the wirecarrying party had no arms orequipmentThe first stage was over There was however still an enormous lot ofwork to be donethe trenches had to be improved deepened revettedemplacements had to be made for machine guns and trench mortarsstores for ammunition of all sorts had to be constructed cables hadto be buriedit is but a repetition of what was going on everywhereon that front                                         Gen Hull and his GSO1 LieutCol J E S Brind anartilleryman were considering the problem of attack The mainfeatures of it are noted by Gen Hull as follows     a The village of Hbuterne which affords concealment     from view to within a short distance of our present line and     good observation of the German positions between Gommecourt     and the spur north of the sunken road K17a and b on the     right of the divisional front     b The valleys west of Hbuterne which afford good     artillery positions and cover from view except from the     trees in Gommecourt Park     c The spur running eastward from Hbuterne just north of     the HbuternePuisieux Road which defilades the area north     of the spur from the German trenches south of the spur     d Gommecourt Park and village which to a certain     extent dominate the ground to the south     e The spur running from E29c northeast of Gommecourt     through K5a and b to the Rossignol Wood along the southern     portion of which spur runs the German fourth line     This spur commands the eastern edge of Gommecourt dominates          25     the German trench system southeast and south of     Gommecourt and affords concealment both for battery     positions in the valley to the east and for a covered means     of approach for a counterattack against the captors of     Gommecourt     f The valley southeast of Nameless Farm in which runs     the PuisieuxGommecourt Road a line of approach covered     from view from our present lineIt was once asked after a severe action for the capture of some risingground What is the use of turning Fritz off a hill There is alwaysanother hill behind it Which was true enough But it is as well toremember that the high ground to the left as far as Blairville heldat this date by the Germans was in 1918 in our hands and it enabledSir Douglas Haig to turn the whole of the old Somme positionOf the German line Gen Hull says     The German position southeast of Gommecourt Park and     village consists of three lines of trenches of which the     first is heavily wired the second lightly wired the third     does not appear to be wired at all unless there is sunken     wire on the road All three lines are visible from our     present position except the second and third lines behind     the strong point K11c and d The northern flank of this     system of trenches rests on the southern edge of Gommecourt     Park the trenches along which are organised to fire south     The southern flank of the system rests on the strong point     K11c     In rear of this system is another consisting of two lines of     trenches running from the southeast corner of Gommecourt     along the ridge in 5Ka b and c to Rossignol Wood The     front trench of this system is heavily wired and visibleIn a most interesting paper on the proposed attack Gen Hull says        26     The object of the VII Corps attack will be to establish     itself on the line 16 PoplarsNameless FarmLittle ZTree at     E23a12     The 46th Division will attack from the north and the     question was discussed          a Should we endeavour to secure a footing on the          ridge E29cK5a in the initial assault or          b Should the 56th Division first secure the German          third line from the southeast corner of Gommecourt          Wood and then under Corps direction launch a second          attack to secure the ridge     Whichever solution the Corps Commander considers it wisest     to adopt there is one point which I wish to urge that no     advance through the village or park of Gommecourt should be     attempted until the ridge E29cK5a is secured     The clearing of the village and wood is bound to be a costly     enterprise if the enemy makes any attempt to fight it out     It is to be hoped that the heavy bombardment will very     seriously affect the moral of the garrison of the     village and park and I consider that the knowledge that     they were cut off from escape and from reinforcements might     have so great an effect on the German troops as to make them     surrender and so save us valuable troops for further     operations     I was and still am in favour of the first solution ie     to secure the Quadrilateral in the first assault The     reasons which have been urged against this course are          a That at Loos no success was achieved after a          certain limited distance had been carried          b That in the event of either the 46th or the 56th          Divisions failing to achieve their objective the          detachment of the other would be in an extremely          isolated position     I have carefully considered both these arguments and do not         27     think there is any reason to alter my opinion     At Loos the 47th Division was the only division to which a     definite objective was given Its rle was to form a     defensive flank on the right of the IV Corps Its left flank     advanced nearly 2500 yards behind the German front line     without serious loss or difficulty In the present case I am     proposing an advance at one point on each divisional front     of only 800 yards in the case of the 56th Division and     less in the case of the 46th Division In the present case     too we have the additional advantage of much heavier     artillery more ammunition and a salient to attack     As regards the second argument that in the event of one or     other attack failing the detachment of the other division     would be isolated     In the event of my reaching my objective in K5a and the     46th Division failing to reach E29c I should consider it my     duty to put in troops if necessary from my reserve brigade     to help the 46th Division     Troops at K5a would be within 500 yards of the unit at the     southeastern edge of Gommecourt and in direct     communication by visual signalling with my present trench     system so that they can hardly be considered isolated and     the risk if any is I consider worth running in order to     isolate completely the enemy troops in Gommecourt Park and     village     I do not like the idea of delay and a second attack to     capture the Quadrilateral in K5a The second attack would     have to be launched from our front line trenches as I do     not consider it would be feasible to organise and launch an     attack from the newlycaptured trenches Any delay would     enable the enemy to put his barrage in front of our     frontline system as if there is a weak point in our     organisation it is in the number of counterbatteries     available to deal with the enemy guns If we delay we lose     the advantage surprise would give usWhile these problems were being discussed Sir Douglas Haig had           28decided to hurry on his preparations We have seen that his desire wasto delay as much as possible and perfect his machine also that everyday meant to him added strength But meanwhile the Entente Powers werebeing pressed in another direction The Austrians had attacked theItalians with great initial success By the end of May the situationon that front was so serious that the Russian offensive was opened inthe early days of June in order to relieve the pressureThe Germans accuse the Austrians of having drained their front inGalicia of artillery for their Italian offensive and also of holdingthe line with troops of poor quality However that may be GenBrussiloffs army after a relatively short artillery preparation got up from their trenches and simply marched forward Falkenhayn hasa delightful observation on the whole business A reconnaissancelike Brussiloffs was only possible of course if the General haddecisive reason for holding a low opinion of his enemys power ofresistance And on this point he made no miscalculationThe immediate effect of the Russian success was the transfer of threedivisions from the Western Front and later more followed but theGermans were still very strong in numbers and there was no slackingoff of their efforts on Verdun They were able to help the Austriansto check the Russian advance and eventually to repulse it but on theother hand the Italian counterattack met with success and drove theAustrians backSir Douglas Haig says that     The heroic defence of our French Allies had already gained          29     many weeks of inestimable value and had caused the enemy     very heavy losses but the strain continued to increase In     view therefore of the situation in the various theatres of     war it was eventually agreed between Gen Joffre and myself     that the combined French and British offensive should not be     postponed beyond the end of June The object of that     offensive was threefold          1 To relieve the pressure on Verdun          2 To assist our Allies in the other theatres of war          by stopping any further transfer of German troops from          the Western Front          3 To wear down the strength of the forces opposed to usWe begin to see now the dominating influence of Verdun In any casethe offensive could not have been postponed much longer and if it wasan alteration of plan forced by the enemy it was not to be comparedwith the abandonment by the Germans of their offensivewhichFalkenhayn says he had prepared against the British with the object offorestalling the Entente blow on the Western Frontdue to theuncomfortable situation of the AustriansProbably however the date did influence the approaching action ofthe 56th Division The new front line was still a long way from theenemy The Queens Westminster Rifles succeeded in advancing a smallsector of the line by a hundred yards and had there been time thewhole division would have crept closer before jumping on the enemyThe weather too was very badIn due course Gen Hull issued his preliminary instructions fromwhich it will be seen that the decision to attempt the capture of theQuadrilateral in one operation had been taken     The attack of the 56th Division will be carried out by the          30     168th and 169th Brigades whose tasks will be as follows          a The objective of the 168th Brigade will be to          capture the German line from Fair Trench about K11d13          along Farm Fame and Elbe Felon to a point in Fell          fifty yards northwest of the trench junction at K5c52          and to establish itself in three strong points            1 About Farmyard Farmer Farm            2 About Elbe between Et and Felon            3 About crosstrenches of Fell and Felon with Epte     168th Brigade will be responsible for the construction of a     fire trench facing southeast to connect the right flank of     the captured line to our present line in W47          b The task of the 169th Brigade will be carried out          in three phases The object of the 169th Brigade in the          first phase will be to capture the line of German          trenches from the left of the 168th Brigade along Fall          Fellow the Cemetery Eck the Maze Eel and Fir and          to establish strong points            1 From Feud through Ems to the Cemetery inclusive            2 About the Maze            3 About the southeast corner of Gommecourt Park     The second phase of the 169th Brigade attack will take place     immediately after the first phase     The objective of the second phase is the Quadrilateral of     the trenches in the southeast portion of K5a The artillery     lifts will be timed on the assumption that the infantry will     reach Ems between Etch and Fillet twentyfive minutes     after zero and Exe between Etch and Fillet twentyseven     minutes after zero time     The third phase will take place directly after the     Quadrilateral is captured and will consist of the securing          31     of the crosstrenches at K5a78 where Indus crosses Fill and     Fillet and joining hands with the 46th Division along Fill     Fillet will be consolidated facing east     The following will be carried on the man         200 rounds SAA         Waterproof sheet         Haversack         Iron ration and current days

paragraphs     One company 167th Brigade will be placed at the disposal of     the BrigadierGeneral commanding 169th Brigade to hold     sectors Y49 and Y50     Seven officers and 200 men of the 167th Brigade will be     detailed for the control of smoke and will be under the     orders of the Divisional Gas Officer Approximately 1200     men will be required for work under the CRE on     communication trenches across No Mans Land and for carrying     partiesPractice attacks based on these instructions were carried out by thebrigades in reserveWe have written of the constructive preparations which were going onall along the line of proposed attack These preparations werecontinued until the last moment But meanwhile another element wasintroducedthat of destructive preparation It is scarcely necessaryto point out that neither form of preparation could be concealed fromthe enemy The Germans knew as well as we did where we would attackThe Gommecourt sector to be attacked was held by the German 169th and     32170th Regiments with about 112 battalions on the front line 1battalion in support 2 battalions in reserve in Bucquoy and 2companies at Ablainzeville Their artillery consisted of 5 batteriesof heavy artillery and 12 batteries of field artillery Thesebatteries were divided into three groups at Quesnoy Farm on the leftof the British position Biez Wood and Puisieux There was a furthergroup of guns near Adinfer Wood which could assist in the defenceThe 56th Divisional Artillery together with the heavy VII Corps gunshad now to prepare for the infantry assault by smashing up not onlythe wire and trench system but billets and gun positions behind theGerman lines as well As regards villages most attention was given toBucquoy Essart Ablainzeville and AchietleGrandThree groups of artillery were formeda northern group underLieutCol Southam a southern group under LieutCol Macdowelland a wirecutting group under LieutCol Prechtel The northern andsouthern groups were under the orders of the Corps and consisted of                           NORTHERN GROUP     3 batteries of 18pounders until zero day then 4 batteries     1 battery 45 howitzers

the call of the       counterbattery groupIn the preliminary instructions it will be noticed that a party ofofficers and men were detailed to act under the Divisional GasOfficer Their special duty was to cover the approach of the infantryby the discharge of a smoke cloud It was hoped to introduce someelement of surprise by occasional discharges of smoke during thepreparatory bombardment and so the Corps ordered that the bombardmentshould be carried out for a period of five days and the attack wouldtake place on the sixth These days would be known as U V W X Yand Z days     Smoke discharges lasting for a period of ten minutes will     take place on the days and at the hours mentioned below     They will coincide with the intense artillery bombardment of     the enemy trenches These bombardments will commence thirty     minutes before the smoke and will reach their maximum     intensity during the ten minutes that it is being discharged          U day no discharge          V day no discharge          W day from 1015 am to 1025 am          X day from 545 am to 555 am          Y day from 715 am to 725 am     On Z day the smoke cloud will commence five minutes before     zero On the 46th and 56th Divisional fronts its duration     will be as arranged by divisions On the 37th Divisional             34     front it will continue for one hourU day was the 24th June but the whole of the great attack waspostponed for two days so that instead of having five days of thepreliminary bombardment there were sevenNaturally the Germans did not sit still under this destructive firebut retaliated on our front line and trench system and on our rearorganisation The enemy artillery had been active during the month ofMay and the division had suffered in casualties to the extent of 402for the month of June casualties leapt up to 801 The end of June wasa prolonged crash of guns Only for one halfhour from 4 pm didthe guns cease so that aeroplanes might take photographs of the Germanlines and then the sky was speckled with the puffs of smoke from theGerman antiaircraft gunsThe guns of the 56th Division fired altogether 115594 rounds ofwhich 31000 were fired on Z day To this total must be added the workof the Corps heavy artillery The 6inch 92inch and 15inch firedon V day 3200 rounds on W day 2200 rounds on X day 3100 roundsand on Y day 5300 rounds which was repeated on the two extra daysat the frontline trenches and strong points 6inch 92inch47inch 45inch and 60pounder guns also dealt with the villagesof Bucquoy AchietleGrand Essart and Ablainzeville but in nothinglike the same proportion of roundsThe first smoke cloud was discharged on the 26th June and drew verylittle hostile machinegun fire The enemy lines were reported to bemuch damaged on that day On the 27th the smoke discharge was somewhat    35spoilt by the premature bursting of a smoke shell an hour before theappointed time This misfortune caused the enemy to put down a barrageon our frontline and communication trenches which prevented thesmoke detachments getting to their appointed positions When the cloudwas eventually discharged there was a large gap in the centre of itso it must have been obvious to the enemy that it was only a feintThe continual bombardment became more intense and the enemy replymore vigorous On the 28th the enemy wire was reported assatisfactorily cut in front of their first and second lines Observersalso noted that there was considerable movement of troops behind theGerman linesEvery night the moment it was dark although the artillery stillpounded trenches roads and tracks patrols crept forward toascertain what progress had been made in the battering down ofdefences 2Lieut P Henri of the 3rd London Regt raided the frontline He found the Germans working feverishly to repair their trenchand succeeded in capturing one prisoner who proved to be of theLabour Battalion of the 2nd Reserve Guards Division He reported thatthe wire in some places still formed a considerable obstacleA patrol of the 1st London Regt reported on the 29th that newFrench wire and some strands of barbed wire had been put up Up to thelast moment the Germans worked at their defences Great activity wasseen on the morning of the 30thThe artillery grew more furious A hail from heavy and fieldgunbatteries descended on trenches and strong points LieutCol            36Prechtels wirecutting group pounded away at the wire The trenchmortar batteries added their quota though they were chased frompillar to post by German retaliation And as the evening shadows fellon the last day the usual night firing was taken up by theneverwearying gunners                                         The main object of this attack was to divert against the VII Corpsenemy artillery and infantry which might otherwise have been usedagainst the left flank of the Fourth Army at Serre To achieve thisresult the two divisions 46th and 56th were given the task ofcutting off the Gommecourt salientFrom the 24th to the 30th June the line of the 56th Division was heldby the 167th Brigade The other two brigades then practised theassault on a replica of the German defence system near Halloy In theearly morning of the 1st July the 168th and 169th Brigades took overthe line and the 167th withdrew to HbuterneThe 5th Cheshire Regt had a company with each of the assaultingbrigades the Royal Engineers sent a section of the 21st London FieldCoy with the 169th Brigade and a section of the 22nd London FieldCoy with the 168th BrigadeThe London Scottish attacked on the right with the Kensingtons insupport then came the Rangers with the 4th London Regt in supportThe rle of these battalions of the 168th Brigade may be brieflydescribed as a halfwheel to the right They had to capture the strongpoint round about Farm and Farmer trenches and establish other strongpoints at Elbe and Et southeast of Nameless Farm and the junctionof Felon and EpteOn the extreme left of the division was the London Rifle Brigade and     37next to them the Queen Victorias Rifles Again as a rough indicationof their task they had to make a left wheel and hold the line of theedge of Gommecourt Park establishing strong points The QueensWestminster Rifles would then push straight on carrying the attackforward as it were between the right and left wheels and capturethe strong point known as the QuadrilateralAt 625 am every gun opened on the German lines and for one hourthe enemy was pelted with shells of all sizes the maximum speed offire being reached at 720 and lasting for ten minutes At this momentsmoke was discharged from the left of our line near Z hedge and infive minutes the smoke was dense along the whole front Then theassaulting battalions climbed out of their trenches and advancedsteadily into the heavy fogThe German front line was reached with little lossthere wasmachinegun fire but it was apparently high Almost immediatelyhowever the Germans gave an indication of their countermeasurestheywere reported by the London Scottish to be shelling their own lineThis gallant regiment succeeded in gaining practically the whole ofits objectives but they were never very comfortable Owing to thesmoke the two left companies lost direction the flank company beingdrawn off in the direction of Nameless Farm and the inner companyfailed to recognise its position and overran its objective This wasin no way surprising as it was extremely difficult owing to theheavy bombardment to find in some places any trench at allNext to the London Scottish the Rangers met with strong resistance and   38probably strayed a bit to their left They were soon in trouble andtwo companies of the 14th London Regt were sent forward to reinforcethem Together these two units succeeded in reaching the junction ofEpte with Felon and Fell but there was a gap between them and theLondon ScottishOn the left of the attack the London Rifle Brigade had swept up to theedge of Gommecourt Park and commenced to consolidate their positionThe Queen Victorias Rifles on the other hand were meeting withfierce resistance and were short of the Cemetery The QueensWestminster Rifles advancing in rear soon became hopelessly mixed upwith the Queen Victorias Rifles Within an hour it became clear thatthe infantry were everywhere engaged in handtohand fightingThe German counterattack plans matured about an hour after theassault was launched Their barrage on No Mans Land was increased tofearful intensity and from Gommecourt Park which was apparentlypacked with men in deep dugouts came strong bombing attacks TheLondon Rifle Brigade called for reinforcements but platoons of thereserve company failed to get through the barrage and across to theGerman front lineThe assaulting companies had been provided with boards bearing thenames of the trenches to be captured and as they fought their wayforward these boards were stuck up to mark the advance At about 930am the artillery observers who did most useful and gallant workduring the whole action could report that all objectives were gainedwith the exception of the Quadrilateral But the troops in the German     39lines were now held there firmly by the enemy barrage they were cutoff from all communication by runners and from all reinforcements Onthe right the Kensingtons had failed in an attempt to reinforce theLondon Scottish Captain Tagart of the former regiment had led hiscompany out but was killed and of the two remaining officers onewas killed and the other wounded A confused message having reachedheadquarters a fresh officer was sent down with orders to rally themen and make another attempt to cross the inferno of No Mans Land Hefound that there were only twenty men left and that to cross withthem was impossibleThe Royal Flying Corps contact machine detailed to report on thesituation sent constant messages that the Quadrilateral was empty oftroops of either side The artillery observers however reportedseeing many parties of hostile bombers moving through the Park andenemy troops collecting behind the CemeteryIt seemed as though all battalions had at one time gained theirobjectives except the Queens Westminster Rifles but no blame fallson this fine regiment LieutCol Shoolbred says in his report Asno officer who got as far as this first line ever returned it isdifficult to know in detail what happened The three captainsCockerill Mott and Swainson were killed before reaching the secondGerman line Apparently the wire on this section of the front was notsatisfactorily dealt with The report says     A great deal of the wire was not cut at all so that both     the Victorias and ourselves had to file in in close order          40     through gaps and many were hit The losses were heavy     before reaching the bank at the GommecourtNameless Farm     road At this point our three companies and the two     Victorias were joined up and intermixed Only one runner     ever succeeded in getting through from the assaulting     companiesThere were a few brave young officers of the Queens Westminsters leftat this point2Lieuts J A Horne A G V Yates A G Negus DF Upton E H Bovill They proceeded to collect their men and leadthem forward and while doing this 2Lieuts Yates and Negus werekilled 2Lieut Upton having then reorganised a bombing partybombed the enemy out of Fellow and reached the Cemetery To do thisthey had to run over the open and drop into Fellow Another partytried at the same time to bomb their way up Etch but found it was toostrongly held by the enemy Meanwhile 2Lieut Upton had stuck up hissignboard and more men doubled up over the open and dropped intoFellow Trench 2Lieut Horne then mounted a Lewis gun under cover ofwhich a platoon of the Cheshire Regt and some Royal Engineers blockedEtch and also Fell it would seem doubtful from this statementwhether Fell was ever heldSergt W G Nicholls had kept a party of bombers together and led bya young lieutenant of the Cheshire Regt whose name unfortunately isnot mentioned [we believe it was 2Lieut G S Arthur] this partyforced its way from the Cemetery to the Quadrilateral The names ofsome of the men are given by Col Shoolbred     Cpl R T Townsend LCpl W C Ide Cpl Hayward     Rfn F H Stow undoubtedly did reach the Quadrilateral             41     where strong enemy bombing parties met them and the     Cheshire lieutenant ordered the party to retire apparently     trying to cover their retirement himself as he was not seen     againIn any case this advance into the Quadrilateral was but a momentarysuccess and it may be said that the attack never got beyond theGerman third line Signals were picked up by the artillery observerscalling for bombs As early as 10 am two parties of London Scottisheach fifty strong attempted to take bombs across to their comradesNone got to the German first line and only three ever got back tooursAbout midday the enemy was launching concerted counterattacks fromall directions He was coming down Epte Ems and Etch he was comingfrom Gommecourt Park he was in Fall on the right More desperateattempts were made to reinforce the hardpressed troops Capt P AJ Handyside of the 2nd London Regt led his company out to try andreach the left of the line He was hit but struggled on He was hitagain and killed as he led a mere halfdozen men into the German firstlineCapt J R Garland also of the 2nd London Regt attempted the samefeat with his company and met with a like fate All the officers ofboth companies were casualtiesAt 2 pm the London Scottish still held firm on the right and theLondon Rifle Brigade on the leftindeed 2Lieut R E Petley withthirty men hung on to Eck three hours after the rest of his battalionhad been ordered to fall back on Ferret the German first line Butalthough the two flanks held the troops in the centre were gradually     42forced back until isolated posts were held in the second German lineBy 4 pm nothing more was held than the German first lineBy 9 pm everyone who could get there was back in our own linesBut we must not leave our account of the fighting with the story ofthe 46th Division untold It was not unreasonable for the men of the56th Division to hope while they were being hardly pressed that the46th Division might suddenly come to their aid Perhaps luck wouldfavour that divisionThe attack from the north was launched between the Gommecourt road andthe Little Z The 137th Brigade with the 6th South StaffordshireRegt on the right and the 6th North Staffordshire Regt on the lefthad Gommecourt Wood in front of them The 139th Brigade with the 5thSherwood Foresters on the right and the 7th Sherwood Foresters on theleft carried the attack up to the Little ZThe account of this action is one long series of disasters It seemsthat the South Staffords on the right started by getting bogged in themud A new front line had been dug but they could not occupy it forthis reason They filed out through gaps in their wire and if anysucceeded in reaching the German front line it was for a period ofminutes only The North Staffords fared no better though a few moremen seem to have gained the enemy first line but were howeverquickly forced out The utmost confusion reigned in that part of theline and the attack from the very start was futileThe 5th and 7th Sherwoods got away to time 730 but     there was a little delay in the fourth wave getting out            43     owing to the deep mud in the trenches and still more delay     in the carrying parties moving up due to a similar reason     and also on account of the enemy barrage of artillery     rifle and machinegun fire which became very heavy on our     old front line Of the 5th Sherwoods the first and second     waves reached the enemy first line fairly easily but were     scattered by the time this occurred The third and fourth     waves suffered severely in crossing from machinegun fire     The majority of the first and second waves passed over the     firstline trenches but there is no evidence to show what     happened to them there for not a man of the battalions that     reached the German second line has returned The remaining     waves  found that the enemy who must have taken refuge     in deep dugouts had now come up and manned the parapet in     parties The Germans were noticed to be practically all     bombers The first three waves of the 7th Sherwoods the     left of the attack moved out to time and found the wire     well cut So far as is known only a small proportion of     these three waves reached the German second line and after     a bomb fight on both flanks the survivors fell back on the     German first line where they found other men of the     battalion consolidating After expending all their bombs in     repelling a German counterattack the survivors retired     over the parapetOne can therefore say that half an hour after the attack waslaunched the Germans in the Gommecourt salient had only the 56thDivision to deal with We know that the Cemetery was seen to beoccupied by our troops about nine oclock and it was probably shortlyafter this that the party of Queens Westminster Rifles led by thegallant lieutenant of the Cheshires reached the Quadrilateral But the   44Germans were then masters of the situation on the north of the salientand freed from all anxiety in that quarter could turn their wholeattention to the 56th Division Up to this time fighting had beenhard but slow progress had been made and with even moderate successon the part of the 46th Division depression and bewilderment mighthave seized the enemy But he turned with elation to the southernattack and shortly after 930 am small parties of bombers were seenmoving through Gommecourt Park to attack the London Rifle Brigade andstrong attacks were launched from the east of Gommecourt villageFor the rest of the day no help came from the 46th Division though anew attack was ordered postponed and postponed again The plan wasto reorganise assaulting waves from the carrying parties and at 330in the afternoon it seemed probable that an attack would materialisebut it did not It was perhaps as well for by that time the 56thDivision occupied the German front line only and that in very weakstrengthAs night fell all became quiet The 167th Brigade relieved the 168thon the right the 169th reorganisedGeneral Hulls conclusions on this action are that     the primary reason for failing to retain the ground was a     shortage of grenades This shortage was due to          a The enemys barrage and in a lesser extent the          machinegun fire from the flanks which prevented          supplies being carried across No Mans Land          b To the breadth of No Mans Land          c Possibly to insufficient means of collecting          grenades and SAA from men who had become                     45          casualties and from German stores     I understand that our counterbattery groups engaged a very     large number of German batteriesthe results were not     apparent and I think this was due to the limited number of     guns available and also to the small calibre of the     majority employed 60pounders 47 guns and 45     howitzers I consider it would be better to employ the     heavy 92 and medium 6 howitzers and even the     superheavy     It was particularly noticeable that once our attack was     launched the Germans attempted practically no counterwork     The preliminary bombardment started on the 24th June and     continued for seven days During this period the enemy     seemed to have increased the number of his batteries The     effect of the bombardment on the German trenches was very     great  on the dugouts the effect was negligible On the     moral of the enemy the effect was not so great as one     would have hoped     I am doubtful of the value of these long bombardments which     give the enemy time to recognise the points selected for the     attack and possibly to relieve his troops and to     concentrate guns and to bring up ammunition     The intense bombardment prior to the attack lasted     sixtyfive minutes considerably longer than any of the     previous bombardments I am in favour of having as many     false attacks and lifts of artillery fire as possible but     consider there should be no difference     The German attitude and moral varied considerablysome of     the enemy showed fight but other parties were quite ready     to surrender as soon as they came up from their dugouts But     it cannot be said that their moral was any more shattered     by the bombardment than were their dugouts Later in the day         46     German bombers advanced with great boldness being assisted     by men who advanced over the open Our men appear to have     had no difficulty in dealing with enemy bombers at firstit     was only when bombs were scarce that the enemy succeeded in     pushing us back The counterattacks on the right were never     made in great strength but were prepared by artillery fire     which was followed up closely and boldly by bombers On the     left the enemy appeared to be in greater strength and came     out of Gommecourt village and through the Park in great     numbersThe men of London had done well although the salient remained in thehands of the enemy The effort of the infantry was valiant and theywere supported with devotion by the artillery The artillery observerstook great risks and the conduct of one of LieutCol Prechtelswirecutting batteries is well worthy of note It established itselfpractically in our front line about W48 and fired 1200 roundsduring X Y Y1 Y2 days and on Z day fired a further 1100 roundsThe German plan was as has been shown to prevent all reinforcementsfrom crossing No Mans Land and to deal with those troops who hadlodged themselves in their trench system by strong and wellorganisedbombing attacks  [Illustration 1 THE GOMMECOURT SALIENT            The dotted line is the old British line]  [Illustration GOMMECOURT JULY 1916]There is no doubt that the main object of the attack had beenfulfilled Unpleasant as it may seem the rle of the 56th Divisionwas to induce the enemy to shoot at them with as many guns as could begathered together and also to prevent him from moving troops Theprisoners captured were 141 from units of the 52nd Reserve Divisionand 37 from the 2nd Guards Reserve Division so that no movement of       47troops had occurred on that front and we know that the number ofbatteries had been increased There were many more prisoners thanthis but they were caught in their own barrage as they crossed NoMans Land and large numbers of dead Germans were afterwards found inthat muchbattered beltThe main attack of the Fourth Army launched on the same daysucceeded on the right North of the Ancre as far as Serre our losseswere severe and the initial gains of the assaulting troops could notbe maintained After five days fierce fighting the enemys firstsystem of defence farther south had been penetrated to a depth of amile over a front of six miles But north of the Ancre after thefirst day operations were confined to maintaining a steady pressureon the enemyThis battle with the subsidiary attack on the Gommecourt Salient isknown as the battle of Albert 1916                                         The division was not relieved It had suffered in casualties 182officers and 4567 other ranks The London Scottish had sent 24officers and 847 other ranks into battle and 9 officers and 257 otherranks had come out The Rangers had sent in 23 officers and 780 otherranks6 officers and 280 other ranks came out The Queen VictoriasRifles came out with 22 officers and 160 other ranks the London RifleBrigade 18 officers and 300 other ranks the Queens WestminsterRifles 19 officers and 160 other ranks The supporting battalionssuffered only slightly lessWhen the fighting had abated the enemy seems to have initiated a truce    48to gather in the wounded His own stretcherbearers came out onseeing which ours also went out This state of affairs lasted for anhour when our men were warned to get back to their linesThe state of the line was extraordinary The front line over which somuch labour had been expended had ceased to exist and could only beheld by means of patrols and a few small posts Our main line was nowwhat was known as the R Line the original line when the 56th Divisionarrived in the sector And the front held by the division wasgradually increased From the 3rd July onwards the division took overthe line to the left until on the 8th the 169th Brigade was north ofFonquevillers with its left opposite Little Z Each brigade held itsfront with two battalions in the line one in brigade reserve and onein divisional reserveDuring the night of the 13th the artillery made a demonstration inorder to help the Fourth Army which was again attacking in the southOn this night a patrol of the Queens Westminster Rifles captured aprisoner who proved to be of the 91st Regta normal unitOn the 17th of the month all three brigades attempted raids but theenemy were found to be too alert and no prisoners were obtainedThe division remained on this front keeping the enemy busy until the20th August when it was relieved by the 17th Division and marchedfirst to Doullens then to FromerleGrand then to St Riquier whereit proceeded to refit and train under the orders of the X Corps     [1] Appendix A     [2] General Headquarters 19141916 and

resting thatword must not be taken in too literal a sense One might define itwith greater truth as being a change of location sometimes a merematter of a mile or so at others perhaps fifty miles There were itis true no trenches to man no sentry groups by day and night butthere was always work to be done And the work very naturally hadalways the one end in viewthe defeat of the GermansThe training

action and therewas some grumbling about the nature of the reinforcements Batches ofmen from all sorts of units were drafted to battalions and GeneralHull made great efforts to get this system altered Battalionshowever were of fair strengthWe know that very early in the war the problem of barbed wire had beenexercising the minds of the Staff in general Long after the Presscampaign for high explosives when this form of shell was provided inlarge quantities wirecutting was still ordered with quite a highpercentage of shrapnel But whatever you did however long the timeyou gave to cutting the wire it never disappeared entirely viletreacherous strands stuck out of the earth like brambles stakesremained miraculously upright with waving lengths of wire to grab youby the sleeve or the trousers and when the cutting was well donethere had been a mere substitution of obstaclesthe state of theground blasted into holes pits mounds and mud made progress veryslow and difficultHow was wire to be removedMr Winston Churchill let his mind wander round steamrollers linkedup with chains Other minds thought of tractors At the same timeinventors were considering the old question of moving forts In August    511916 there came from England a weird and fearfullooking machine knownas a TankOn the 26th August the 7th Middlesex practised an attack inconjunction with five Tanks One can easily imagine the Middlesex menand everybody else who had wind of what was afoot all agog at thisnew form of field training What were the criticisms of the London menon this  machineThe Tanks had only been landed in France on the 25th and it is notsurprising that two of them broke down But the practice was continuedon subsequent days until each brigade had acquired experience SirDouglas Haig Marshal Joffre and HRH the Prince of Wales wereinterested spectators of these evolutionsThe orders for this exercise were that the Tanks would cross our frontline at zero hour and would be followed by the first infantry waveone minute later The second wave would start at zero plus threeminutes the third wave at zero plus five minutes the fourth wave atzero plus six minutes The infantry were instructed to advance inshort rushes up to but not beyond the Tanksunless a Tank brokedown when they were to proceed as if it was not thereEveryone seems to have been much impressed by the behaviour of theTanksOn the 31st August General Hull received a warning order that hisdivision would move to Corbie and come under the XIV Corps CavanAnd on the following day the artillery was ordered forward The 168thand 169th Infantry Brigades left St Riquier on the 3rd and the 167thBrigade on the 4th Events came tumbling over one anotherOn the 4th September the leading troops of the division were at the       52Citadel and Happy Valley near Carnoy on the 5th at Maricourt SidingAnd on the 6th September the 56th Division was ordered to relieve the5th Division that night in the front lineNo one will ever be able to describe in adequate fashion the scenebehind the Somme battle front Piccadilly in the height of the seasonwith its slowmoving and everstopping traffic may give some idea ofthe state of the roadsonly one must substitute army carts limberslorries for smart limousine cars and buses one must substitute aloose stone road covered with six inches of mud and holes three feetdeep filled with water for the smooth wood paving of thatthoroughfare And there were no pavements no sidewalks The infantrythreaded its way in single file through this mass of dirty carts andsweating men and horses and overheated motorlorries haltingsometimes for hours or broke away acrosscountry where although thetraffic was not so congested obstacles such as cavalry linestransport lines camps and as the forward area was penetrated linesof heavy guns and howitzers were met withThe whole country seemed pulsing with life and effort Here was nolaboursaving device of peaceful civilisation but a continual strainof muscle and sinew Difficulties were overcome by straining horsesstraining men for where the greatest difficulty existed the enginewas of no use And through the midst of all this threading its way inlong files passed the 56th Division                                         We have said that the results of the first five days of fightingwhich started on the 1st July was an advance of one mile on a front      53of six miles This was followed by minor engagements to adjust thelineThe two northern Corps of the attacking Army were given to Sir HubertGough with instructions to keep the enemy busy while Sir HenryRawlinson battered his way through farther southOn the 14th July the Fourth Army was again launched on a front fromLongueval to BazentinlePetit Wood This battle was continued forseveral days and established the Army on a line from Maltz Horn FarmMontauban where it joined on to the left of the French along theeastern edge of Trones Wood to Longueval then westward pastBazentinleGrand to the northern corner of BazentinlePetit and thewood and so to the north of Ovillers Over 2000 prisoners weretaken which brought the total since the opening of the offensive tomore than 10000 also in this battle we captured 4 heavy guns 42fieldguns 30 trench mortars and 52 machine guns [Battle ofBazentin Ridge]But our line from Pozires to Delville Wood and Longueval and thensouth of Maltz Horn Farm where it was carried still south by theFrench to the village of Hem made a most unpleasant salient Theenemy had excellent observation from Guillemont and could bring amass of surrounding artillery to bear on a comparatively small areapacked with troops guns and supplies To relieve this mostuncomfortable position it was arranged that the right of the BritishArmy should swing forward in conjunction with the French To do thisthe French would have to capture the strongly fortified villages ofMaurepas Le Foret Rancourt and Frigicourt while we would have totake all the country up to SaillySaillisel and Morval which included    54the capture of Flers Gueudecourt Ginchy Guillemont and Les BufsBefore this could be done the enemy on the 18th July launched astrong counterattack on Delville WoodLonguevalWaterlot Farm Andthis was the prelude to much fierce and very confusing fighting [Thebattle of Delville Wood commenced on the 15th July and ended 3rdSeptember]On the 30th July we attacked Guillemont and Falfemont Farm inconjunction with our Allies but without success and on the 7thAugust our troops again entered Guillemont and were again driven outGuillemont was the important point to be gained but it was evidentthat it could not be won in a small engagement and as the onlyobjective without heavy loss So we and the French made a series ofattacks advancing foot by foot on Maurepas Falfemont GuillemontLeuze Wood and Ginchy But no great progress was made And so themonth of August passedOn the 3rd September a combined French and British attack was made ona wide front extending on the left to the Ancre so that both theFourth and Fifth Armies were engaged The gain in front of Sir HubertGoughs Army was small but the Fourth Army managed to win themuchdisputed Guillemont and after many assaults Falfemont Farmwhich was only completely captured on the 5th and the greater partof Leuze Wood Ginchy and High Wood remained in the hands of theGermans but we had made a step in the right direction and hadadvanced our right to a depth of one mile on a front of nearly twomiles and captured over a thousand prisoners [Battle of Guillemont3rd6th September]This was briefly the situation when the 56th Division marched           55forward to take over the line from the 5th Division                                         BrigGen Loch was ordered to take over a portion of the line andaccordingly the 168th Brigade moved from Maricourt Siding in thedirection of Falfemont Farm and came under the orders of the 5thDivision The local situation was always most difficult to grasp TheSomme field of battle was the most hideous place and absolutelybewildering A guide was a treacherous person to trust or perhaps weshould say he was a broken reed to lean on for the poor fellow had notreacherous intent in his heart he was anxious enough to lead troopsin the right direction but nine times out of ten was completely losta few minutes after he started And there were perhaps more mistakesmade in attempting to trace the front line in that great battle thanin any otherGuillemont was held by us Combles was strongly held by the GermansBetween these two places was Leuze Wood We held with more or lesscertainty the line of the road between Leuze Wood and Guillemont andwe also held the country between Leuze Wood and Falfemont Farm andhad pushed troops into the wood itself but the situation in the restof the square marked 27 was very vague see mapthe only certainthing was that there were many Germans there Except for the wood andthe line of the road to Guillemont the Germans held all of squares 20and 21 We had a nasty elongated triangle pushed into enemyterritory and it had a wobbly right side to itThe Kensingtons went into the front line not very far from Falfemont      56Farm in the lower left corner of square 27 The London Scottish weresupposed to be in support to the Royal Irish Rifles and got into atwofoot scrape unworthy of the name of trench aboutthreequarters of the way through Leuze Wood The Royal Irish Rifleswere imagined to be holding the most southern end of Bouleaux Woodacross the road which separated it from Leuze WoodThe positions were of course taken over at night and the next daythe French attacked Combles In order to help our Allies our gunsstarted a bombardment but unfortunately most of their shells fellaround Leuze Wood It was one of the unavoidable accidents of warClose shooting has to be done and there are many possible causesfrom faulty ammunition to wet ground for guns shooting short It isnone the less annoying to the infantry Capt A H Macgregor of CCompany London Scottish made strong remarks in writing but failedto stop the energetic gunnersThe Irish were having a much worse time than the London Scottish asthey were also being heavily bombarded by the Germans So they decidedto evacuate their trenchAll this led to some confusion and on top of it the enemy launched abombing attack which was probably in support of their counterattackon the French The London Scottish reserve companies which were atWedge Wood moved up and the battalion prepared to defend Leuze Woodwhich they imagined would shortly be heavily attacked But the Irishalthough they lost heavily threw back the German bombers and wererelieved by two companies of the London ScottishBy midnight everything was reestablished as it had been before and     57while probing about in the dark the London Scottish gathered in twoenemy officers and fourteen other ranks of the 107th Infantry Regt asprisonersThe position they were in was on the south of the road and it wasdecided to try and dig a trench on the edge of Bouleaux Wood that ison the other side of the road A platoon was sent forward thefollowing morning to undertake this work It was successfully carriedout and the covering party managed to inflict a good many casualtieson the enemySergt Smith of B Company shot eightand threefurther prisoners were takenThis experience of the London Scottish will give some idea of theconditions which ruled what was officially known as holding theline At any moment a post might be wrested from you and have to befought for again and all the time you were described as establishedin Leuze WoodOn the night of the 7th September the Queen Victorias Rifles tookover this bit of line and the London Scottish went back to Maltz HornFarmOn the night of the 67th September General Hull took over command ofthe divisional front from the GOC 5th Division There was a slightreadjustment of line the next night and it was then held by the 169thBrigade on the right and in touch with the 1st French Division andthe 168th Brigade on the left and in touch with the 16th Division onthe ComblesGuillemont roadThere was to be a big attack on the 9th but the position from whichthe 56th Division had to start was not too satisfactory A study ofthe battle of the Somme will show that at some time or other every        58unit lost direction It was exceedingly difficult to recognise anobjective even the heaps of ruins which marked the sites of villageswere frequently mistaken It is a rolling featureless country Butperhaps the chief cause of loss of direction was the shape of thejumpingoff line The German defence was very obstinate and thefighting severe Troops having made an advance had to hang onanywhere facing the enemy where he opposed them most fiercely Theresult was a zigzag line a crazy front where troops frequently facedeast and west and were told to attack north On an ordinary practicefieldday a platoon commander can get his men out of a trench andmake them wheel in the desired direction but in action attackingtroops will always be drawn towards the nearest firing Men gettingout of a trench and hearing or seeing an enemy in front of them willgo towards him no matter how much orders to the contrary have beendinned into their headsConsider the line of the 56th Division The left along theGuillemontLeuze Wood road was facing due north it then curled roundthe wood and faced southeast another curl made the extreme right ofthe line face northeast The attack on the 9th was to be in anortheasterly directionTo get a better line and form a strong flank facing Combles anattempt was made to clear the enemy from the trenches southeast ofLeuze WoodThe London Rifle Brigade had relieved the Kensingtons on the right ofthe line and companies were somewhat puzzled by their position whichis described as most obscure On the night of the 8th they made a       59bombing attack to clear the trenches on the southeast of the wood Atfirst this met with some success but in the early morning of the 9ththe enemy came at them again in large numbers and they were drivenback to their former position It was not thought advisable to try toregain the lost groundThe attack on the 9th September the battle of Ginchy was by thewhole of the XIV Corps in conjunction with the XV Corps on the leftThe XIV Corps held Guillemont and Delville Wood was held by the XVCorps The object was to capture Ginchy and bring the line up to point1417 and from there down to Leuze Wood Incidentally it meantclearing the ground to the southeast of the wood but in followingthe actions from this date it must be remembered that the HigherCommand intended to work round Combles and so the right of theBritish Army was always working to form a defensive flank until theadvance reached a point which would enable troops to join hands withthe French on the far side of ComblesThe task of the 169th Brigade was the forming of a flank againstCombles by capturing the trenches southeast of the wood the trenchesthey had failed to take by bombing and to advance their line a shortway through Bouleaux WoodThe 168th Brigade who were on the line of the GuillemontLeuze Woodroad were to pivot on their right the advance from the northern endof the wood was very slight and bring their left up to point 1417This right form was to be done in two stages the road to Ginchymarking the halfway lineThe artillery were ordered to put up a creeping and stationarybarrage Fifty per cent of guns were to fire on a known position as      60a stationary barrage the other 50 per cent were to start just aheadof the infantry and creep forward at the rate of fifty yards a minuteuntil the stationary barrage was reached when the latter would bejumped forward to the next stationary barrage lineIt will be gathered from the foregoing account of how the 56thDivision took over the line that the conditions under which theinfantry waited for the resumption of attack were not dissimilar tothose at the end though not the actual termination of anengagementwhen nobody knows within a few hundred yards where anyunit really is And indeed that was always the situation during thebattle of the Somme There was perpetual unrest in the lineThe battle on the 9th has always seemed like a wild rush infastfading light It was to open at 445 pm but on the left of theCorps it seems to have been delayed Nowhere was it entirelysuccessful in the assault The situation remained obscure and fightingcontinued for several daysThe truth of the whole matter was that the enemy defended Combles withdesperation The right of the 56th Division had as hard a task as wasever set for any troops and on their left was a German strong pointbearing the ominous name of the Quadrilateral the strength of whichwas only learned at bitter cost We will follow the fortunes of thedivision from the right of the lineThe 169th Brigade was on the right with the London Rifle Brigade andthe Queen Victorias Rifles attacking Leuze Wood as we know wasalways a dangerous spot and the task of the London Rifle Brigade wasto capture those trenches on the southeast of the wood and start the     61building up of the flank facing Combles But the moment the men lefttheir jumpingoff trenches their attack was met and destroyed by ahail of rifle and machinegun fireOn the left of the London Rifle Brigade the Queen Victorias Rifleswhose objective was the enemy trench on the far side of the Comblesroad met with more success and gained a precarious footing in a partof that line But no troops of the 169th Brigade could be said to beestablished anywhere on their objectivePart of the 2nd London Regt was given to the London Rifle Brigadeand a second attack was launched on the trenches southeast of thewood almost simultaneously with a counterattack by the enemy fromhis Bouleaux Wood defences The Queen Victorias Rifles held on totheir gains but the second attack on the trenches southeast of thewood failed The Queens Westminster Rifles who were in reserve weresent forThe 168th Brigade on the left of the division attacked with the 4thLondon Regt on the right and the Rangers on the left The 4thLondons pivoting on the north end of Leuze Wood gained their firstobjective under close cover of our barrage and with little loss Butthe Rangers came under heavy machinegun fire from their left It wasascertained from a prisoner captured later that a whole battalion ofhis regiment the 161st of the 185th Division was in the centre ofthe square marked 20The left company of the Rangers with the troops of the 16th Divisionon their left met a strong force of the enemy and were driven back totheir point of departure The right company however after hardfighting which lasted until 6 pm reached their first objective the    62line of the road from Leuze Wood to GinchyMeanwhile the 4th London Regt sticking close to the artillerybarrage had again advanced at 525 pm and gained their finalobjective But their losses were severe The machinegun fire wastremendous and its effects can be gathered from the fact that a postwhich was left to construct a strong point in the first objective wasentirely wiped outThe right company of the Rangers having gained their first objectiveagain advanced though the opposition they had met with had causedthem to be late on the barrage Again the murderous fire was poured onthem from the left and they swerved so that they came up on thecentre of the 4th London troops These two battalions were now on theline of the trench leading to point 1417 but exactly how near thatpoint was only determined later On the right they were in touch withthe Queen Victorias RiflesBy this time it was quite dark and the left of the 56th Division wasso much in the air that the enemy was on all but one side of it The16th Division had fared badlyThe right brigade of the 16th Division had not been able to advance atall and were scattered about in front of Guillemont The left brigadehad secured a footing in Ginchy and the 3rd Brigade of the GuardsDivision was already on its way to relieve the whole of the 16thDivision But the situation was far from goodThe Kensingtons who were in support to the 168th Brigade had movedforward to occupy the departure trenches and the commanding officer     63seeing something of what had happened promptly tried to strengthenthe flank of the 4th London Regt and the Rangers He disposed of hisbattalion in forward positions with the object of protecting the leftflank The London Scottish were sent forBefore 11 pm the two reserve battalions the London Scottish and theQueens Westminster Rifles had arrived in the vicinity of Leuze WoodBut the situation which faced General Hull at midnight was not acomfortable one His left was surrounded by Germans and probably onlyprotected by the night and his right was uncertain there had beenreports of enemy snipers in Leuze Wood and the enemy was certainlypressing strongly with his bombersBoth brigades were ordered to attack againFollowing events from the right of the line the Queens Westminsterswere ordered to attack and capture the trenches southeast of the woodbefore dawn The night was pitch dark and the Germans were pouringshells into the wood The exact bearing of the trench and its distancefrom the wood were unknown to the battalion It was impossible toarrange an earlier hour than 7 am for the attackPatrols were sent out to get in touch with the enemy and reconnoitrethe ground and while the battalion waited casualties mounted up Atlast came the dawn but it brought no light a thick mist had settledover the country At 7 am the attack startedTwo companies attacked The right company went straight ahead and theleft was told to swing to their left and take a trench beyond thesunken road leading to Combles The barrage was described as              64ineffective which was maybe due to the fog At any rate neithercompany reached its objective The enemy was lining his defences inforce and poured in a hot fire with rifles and machine gunsLater in the day a further attack was launched but met with nosuccess and the situation during the whole of the morningcomplicated by the thick mist remained extremely uncertainOn the 168th Brigade front the London Scottish had not waited tilldawn for their attack They formed up in six waves in trenches dug bythe 5th Cheshires on the extreme left of the original line ofdeparture and were ordered to thrust through moving due north andfill the gap between the 4th London Regt and the troops of the 16thDivision in Ginchy It was hoped that all the enemy troops in square20 would be cut offA quarter of an hour after midnight in pitch darkness the battalionstarted to advance The first three waves progressed some 600 yardsand then failing to see any landmarks or recognise where they werethey halted and sent out patrols The last three waves were nowhere insight they had lost direction and joined the 4th London Regt andRangers on their right But while the leading waves waited for theirpatrols to get in touch with either friend or foe they were attackedby about a hundred Germans from their rear The London Scottishwhipped round and scattered them at the point of the bayonet Theenemy vanished but left a considerable number of dead on the groundThe London Scottish were now completely lost and so marched south topick up their position againThe attempted attack however was not repeated but two and a half       65companies were sent to the trench occupied by the 4th London Regt andthe Rangers Bully where they attempted by bombing to reach point1417 Their efforts were not successfulMeanwhile the situation to the left of the 56th Division was no lessobscure The 3rd Brigade of the Guards Division had been hurried up inthe dark to relieve the 16th Division The guides of the left brigadeof the latter division led a relieving battalion into Ginchy but hadonly the haziest idea where their own troops were Part of the 16thDivision on the east of the village was not relieved until midday onthe 10th Ginchy was repeatedly attacked by the enemy and no one knewwith any certainty what was happeningThe right brigade of the 16th Division was not relieved for some timeThe guides to the relieving battalion lost themselves completely anda big gap existed between Ginchy and Guillemont During the 10th thisgap was made good but the whole of that day was occupied by repulsingenemy attacks and trying to establish a definite lineOn the 56th Division front there were repeated bombing attacks by theenemy and the SOS was sent up several times We may say that thebattalion reports of positions were only relatively accurate and thatnothing was clear to Gen Hull until the weather improved and airreports could be madeRelief of the 168th Brigade by the 167th and of the 169th by acomposite brigade of the 5th Division took place and it was thenascertained that the London Scottish had as related above lostdirection in their attack and that no one was near the Ginchy1417road The enemy still held the Quadrilateral in force and the most       66advanced troops of the 56th Division were some way from it thoughthey were strongly established in Bully Trench and the enemy werestill in square 20 But the 56th and Guards Divisions were now intouch and a firm line was held along the GuillemontLeuze Wood roadand from the crossroads to Ginchy which was also firmly heldThe Quadrilateral was the dangerpoint and it defied all attempts totake it by bombing and successfully withstood the Corps heavyartillery                                         Sir Douglas Haig sums up the situation at this point as follows      The French had made great progress on our right     bringing their line forward to Louage Wood just south of     Combles Le Foret ClrysurSomme all three inclusive     The weak salient in the Allied line had therefore     disappeared and we had gained the front required for     further operations     Still more importance however lay in the proof afforded in     the results described of the ability of our new armies not     only to rush the enemys strong defencesas had been     accomplished on the 1st and 14th Julybut also to wear down     and break the power of resistance by a steady relentless     pressure as had been done during the weeks of this fierce     and protracted struggle As has already been recounted the     preparations made for our assault on the 1st July had been     long and elaborate but though the enemy knew that an attack     was coming it would seem that he considered the troops     already on the spot secure in their apparent impregnable     defences would suffice to deal with it The success of that     assault combined with the vigour and determination with     which our troops pressed their advantage and followed by the     successful attack on the night of 14th July all served to           67     awaken him to a fuller realisation of his danger The great     depth of his system of fortifications to which reference     has been made gave him time to reorganise his defeated     troops and to hurry up numerous fresh divisions and more     guns Yet in spite of this he was still pushed back     steadily and continuously Trench after trench and strong     point after strong point were wrested from him The great     majority of his repeated counterattacks failed completely     with heavy loss while the few that achieved temporary     success purchased it dearly and were soon thrown back from     the ground they had for the moment regained     The enemy had it is true delayed our advance considerably     but the effort had cost him dear and the comparative     collapse of his resistance during the last days of the     struggle justified the belief that in the longrun decisive     victory would lie with our troops who had displayed such     fine fighting qualities and such indomitable endurance and     resolution     Practically the whole of the forward crest of the main     ridge on a front of some 9000 yards from Delville Wood to     the road above Mouquet Farm was now in our hands and with     it the advantage of observation over the slopes beyond East     of Delville Wood for a further 3000 yards to Leuze Wood     we were firmly established on the main ridge while farther     east across the Combles valley the French were advancing     victoriously on our right But though the centre of our line     was well placed on our flanks there was still difficult     ground to be won     From Ginchy the crest of the high ground runs northwards for     2000 yards and then eastward in a long spur for nearly     4000 yards Near the eastern extremity of the spur stands     the village of Morval commanding a wide field of view and     fire in every direction At Leuze Wood my right was still     2000 yards from its objective at this village and between          68     lay a broad and deep branch of the main Combles valley     completely commanded by the Morval spur and flanked not     only from its head northeast of Ginchy but also from the     high ground east of the Combles valley which looks directly     into it     Up this high ground beyond the Combles valley the French     were working their way towards the objective at     SaillySaillisel situated due east of Morval and standing     at the same level Between these two villages the ground     falls away to the head of the Combles valley which runs     thence in a southwesterly direction In the bottom of this     valley lies the small town of Combles then well fortified     and strongly held though dominated by my right at Leuze     Wood and by the French left on the opposite heights It had     been agreed by the French and myself that an assault on     Combles would not be necessary as the place could be     rendered untenable by pressing forward along the ridges     above it on either side     The capture of Morval from the south side presented a very     difficult problem while the capture of SaillySaillisel at     that time some 3000 yards to the north of the French left     was in some respects even more difficult The line of the     French advance was narrowed almost to a defile by the     extensive and strongly fortified wood of St Pierre Vaast on     the one side and on the other by the Combles valley which     with the branches running out of it and the slopes on either     side is completely commanded as has been pointed out by     the heights bounding the valley on the east and west     The general plan of the combined Allied attack which was     opened on the 15th September was to pivot on the high ground     south of the Ancre and north of the AlbertBapaume road     while the Fourth Army devoted its whole effort to the     rearmost of the enemys original systems of defence between          69     Morval and Le Sars     Should our success in this direction warrant it I made     arrangements to enable me to extend the left of the attack     to embrace the villages of Martinpuich and Courcelette As     soon as our advance on this front had reached the Morval     line the time would have arrived to bring forward my left     across the Thiepval Ridge Meanwhile our Allies arranged to     continue the line of advance in close cooperation with me     from the Somme to the slopes above Combles but directed     their main effort northwards against the villages of     Rancourt and Frigicourt so as to complete the isolation of     Combles and open the way for their attack on     SaillySailliselThat much was hoped from the big attack to take place on the 15ththere can be no doubt Brigades resting in the rear of the divisionalarea could see quantities of cavalry still farther back It suggestedbig resultsThe limits of the Fourth Army attack were Combles Ravine andMartinpuich and it was to capture Morval Les Bufs Gueudecourt andFlers The Cavalry Corps was to have its head on Carnoy at 10 amand as soon as the four villages had been captured it would advanceand seize the high ground round Rocquigny VillersauFlosRiencourtlesBapaume and BapaumeAnd it was the first battle in which Tanks were employed [The battleof FlersCourcelette]Even in the midst of the struggle round about the Quadrilateral asteady bombardment had been going on in preparation of a furtherattack since the 12th September Day firing commenced at 6 am andwent on until 630 pm when night firing started During the night      70bombardment lethal shells were usedOn Z day the preliminary bombardment was to be the same as on formerdays with no increase until zero hour When the intense fire orbarrage commenced there were gaps left in it for the advance ofTanksFor the XIV Corps there were taking part in this attack fifteenTanks Nine were allotted to the Guards Division three to the 6thDivision and three to the 56th DivisionThe instructions given to Tanks were that they should start theirattack at a time which would enable them to reach the first objectivefive minutes before the infantry When they had cleared up the firstobjective a proportion of them was to push forward a short way toprearranged positions and act as strong points Departure from thisprogramme to assist any infantry held up by the enemy was left to thediscretion of the Tank CommanderOn the second objective Tanks and infantry would advance together andpace was to be regulated to tank pace which was given as from 30 to50 yards a minute For the third and fourth objectives there would beno creeping barrage and Tanks would start in time to reach theobjectives before the infantry In all cases their action was to bearranged so as to crush wire and keep down hostile rifle andmachinegun fireSignals between Tank and infantry were arranged for by means ofcoloured flagsa red flag meaning out of action and a green flagam on objectiveThe main task of the 56th Division was to clear Bouleaux Wood and forma strong protective flank covering all the lines of advance from         71Combles and the valleys running from the northeast of Combles The167th Brigade were ordered to advance as far as the bit of Beef Trenchrunning through Bouleaux Wood and to Middle Copse on the left of thewood a flank was also to be formed to the southeast and clear of thewood The 168th Brigade were to pass through the 167th and carry onthe advance by further bounds The 169th Brigade were to hold the linethrough Leuze Wood and the left of square 27 and to capture thewellknown trench Loop Trench to the southeast of the wood whichruns into the sunken road to ComblesOne Tank was to advance on the right of Leuze Wood and assist the169th Brigade to drive the enemy beyond the sunken road it would thenestablish itself in the Orchard as a strong point This Tank wascalled the Right TankTwo Tanks were to work from the north of Leuze Wood along the left ofBouleaux Wood and assist the 167th and 168th Brigades These wereknown as the Centre and Left Tanks and were eventually to proceed toa railway cutting northeast of Bouleaux Wood which promised to be apoint of some difficultyThe Right Tank having seen the 169th Brigade safely in itsobjectives was to move along the southeast of Bouleaux Wood and takeup a position on the cutting in the top end of square 22In the XIV Corps area the Tanks were by no means a success It is onlyright to say that this was not the fault of their crews Every excusemust be allowed for the Tank was not only a new invention and likemost new inventions somewhat clumsy in the first design but theground was absolutely vile We have not alluded to the weather which    72however was a most important factor just now The field of battle wasa field of mud the resting area of the division was a field of mudthe roads and tracks were rivers of mud anyone can paint a picture ofthe battle of the Somme provided he can paint miles of mud And theArmy had simply blasted its way forward so that the shellholes cutone another in the mudThe scene round Leuze Wood Guillemont and Ginchy was a nightmareThere had been little time to devote to the burial of the dead andcorpses lay literally in heaps where the fighting had been severe Onehas only to imagine the results of repeated and obstinate attempts tocapture a position to realise what it must look like before it isfinally taken An attack is launched and fails Why does it failPerhaps twenty men of a company get back to the trench from which theyattacked and where are the others On the ground After five or sixattacks each going out strong and coming back weak each heralded bya barrage what will the place look likeWe may mention here that the stretcherbearers worked with eight mento each stretcher and each ambulance required six horses to drag itthrough the mudJust before 1 am one of the Tanks allotted to the 56th Divisionbroke down on its way to the assembly position This accident left thedivision with one Tank working on either side of the Bouleaux WoodThe assault commenced at 620 am and was followed by some of thefiercest fighting in the history of the war On the right of thedivision the 2nd London Regt succeeded after some hours of gallant      73and determined effort in driving the enemy from the greater part ofLoop Trench the enemy clinging to the junction with the sunken roadThe Tank which was some time before reaching the sunken road gavevaluable assistance but was set on fire by a direct hit from a fieldgun The fight then turned to the sunken road and the trench on thefar side of it but the enemy was strong and no less determined thanthe men of the 169th Brigade No further advance was gained in thisdirectionOn the left of the division the 167th Brigade attacked with the 1stLondon Regt in line and the 7th Middlesex in support in Leuze WoodThe 1st London Regt captured that portion of Beef Trench outsideBouleaux Wood and together with the 7th Middlesexwho were toadvance through them but both units became mixedoccupied MiddleCopseSo far as the 56th Division was concerned the result of the daysfighting remained with the advance on the southeast of Leuze Wood asfar as the Combles road and on the northwest of Bouleaux Wood toBeef Trench and Middle Copse The enemy retained the whole of BouleauxWood and the trenches to the north of the Combles road and the roaditself But the action certainly of the 167th Brigade was influencedby the fortunes of the divisions on the leftThe centre of the horseshoe which had been formed from the east ofGinchy to the crossroads east of Guillemont and then to the north ofLeuze Wood and along Bully Trench and which was prevented by theQuadrilateral from being a complete circle can scarcely have been anenviable place for the Germans who were there As fighters theseGermans deserve the highest praise They were of the 21st and 7th         74Bavarian Regts of the 5th Bavarian Division They were well wiredin and had in the Quadrilateral deep dugouts in their front lines andothers in the ravine behind the position But though we grant them aperfect position and wellconstructed defences we must also admitthey performed a fine feat of arms Those in the Quadrilateral hadresisted all efforts of the 56th and Guards Divisions to bomb themout and those in the horseshoe had repulsed the 16th Division and the6th Division which attacked them on the 13th They had actually beenunder severe artillery fire and subject to repeated assaults since the9th September and on the 15th in spite of Tanks of creepingbarrages and of the heavy artillery they remained immovableThe worst kind of luck had attended the Tanks of the 6thDivisiononly one managed to reach the jumpingoff line This Tankwent on with the infantry for a short way had all its periscopes shotaway was pierced by most of the bullets which hit it and a perfectstream of fire was directed on it and the driver being badlywounded it retired through the ranks of the 6th Division Had thethree Tanks attacked something might have been done anyhow with theenemy to the southwest of the Quadrilateral but with only one thebarrage arranged with gaps for three became ineffective and aconcentrated fire on the one Tank soon put it out of actionit alsodrew attention to the infantry attack Briefly the 6th DivisionfailedThere was still a chance that the Guards would advance and render theposition of the Bavarians impossible But this chance was notrealised The Quadrilateral was a mass of machine guns and taking       75the Guards Division in flank inflicted fearful casualties The firstobjective was taken and heldon the left the second objective wasreachedbut already the assaulting troops were being shot in the backby the Bavarians and no further progress was made Tanks do not seemto have helped in that direction eitherWith this state of affairs on the left of the 56th Division theattacking brigades were not likely to progress very far in thebuilding up of a flank facing Combles Until the Quadrilateral wastaken the 167th Brigade could not possibly move The 7th Middlesex hadlost a lot of men from machine guns firing into their left rear asthey advanced behind the assault of the 1st London Regt And finallytheir Tank had broken down and was being attacked by the enemyBy 11 am the two reserve battalions of the 169th Brigade were movedforward to be used as reinforcements before the 168th Brigade was sentinto action Gen Hull was determined to clear Bouleaux Wood whichhad resisted so long But at 130 pm the Corps Commander LordCavan telephoned him that the Guards had not made as much progress ashe had thought and that the operation against Bouleaux Wood would notbe practicable But before this order could reach them the 8thMiddlesex made a further attempt to get into the wood and failed Allattention was then centred on the Quadrilateral which was holding upthe advance of no less than three divisionsThe division was ordered to consolidate where it stood but during thenight bombing attacks were carried out by the 169th Brigade on thesunken road and end of Loop Trench and by the 167th Brigade on the       76trench in Bouleaux Woodneither met with successOn the 16th the 6th Division again attacked the Quadrilateral andfailed but they were now well up to the stronghold The GuardsDivision had also crept in from the northThe 17th September was devoted to preparations for attacking on the18th The 169th Brigade made a trench parallel to the sunken road toCombles and also managed to occupy some 200 yards more frontage alongthe road Many dead Germans of the 26th Regiment were foundThe attack on the 18th was in conjunction with the 6th Division Thetask of the 56th Division was to capture the trench on the north ofthe sunken road to Combles and the southwest face of Bouleaux Woodto a point beyond Beef Trench and from there through the wood toMiddle Copse where touch would be obtained with the 6th Division whowere making another effort to clear the Quadrilateral The attackingbrigades of the latter division declined the aid of Tanks on thisoccasionThe weather was appalling The state of the ground was rather worsethan what is so frequently called a quagmiretroops could not getalongThe 167th Brigade had lost heavily and was not in sufficient strengthto attack so the London Scottish were attached to that brigade Butthe battalion was unable to reach the assaulting lineZero hour was 550 am and on the right the 169th Brigade with theQueens Westminster Rifles and the London Rifle Brigade attackingfailed to cross the fatal sunken road which was not surprising as       77the mud by itself was an almost perfect obstacle from the German pointof view While on the left the London Scottish failure to reach theassembly trench caused the attack to be abandonedBut the 6th Division was successful and the Quadrilateral which gavesuch strong support to the enemy troops holding Bouleaux Wood wascaptured The news was received by everyone with a sigh of reliefOf the fighting as a whole on the 15th September and subsequent daysSir Douglas Haig reported     The advance met with immediate success on almost the whole     of the front attacked At 840 am our Tanks were seen     entering Flers followed by a large number of troops     Fighting continued in Flers for some time but by 10 am     our troops had reached the north of the village and by     midday had occupied the enemys trenches for some distance     beyond On our right our line was advanced to within     assaulting distance of the strong line of defence running     before Morval Les Bufs and Gueudecourt and on our left     High Wood was at last carried after many hours of very     severe fighting reflecting great credit on the attacking     battalions Our success made it possible to carry out during     the afternoon that part of the plan which provided for the     capture of Martinpuich and Courcelette and by the end of     the day both these villages were in our hands On the 18th     September the work of this day was completed by the capture     of the Quadrilateral an enemy stronghold which had hitherto     blocked our progress towards Morval     The result of the fighting on the 15th September and the     following days was a gain more considerable than any which     had attended our arms in the course of a single operation     since the commencement of the offensive In the course of     one days fighting we had broken through two of the enemys          78     main defensive systems and had advanced on a front of over     six miles to an average depth of a mile In the course of     this advance we had taken three villages each powerfully     organised for prolonged resistance The total number of     prisoners taken by us in these operations amounted to over     4000 including 127 officersThe 168th Brigade on the left of the divisional front wasresponsible for holding Middle Copse On the two nights of the 19thand 20th September the London Scottish provided covering parties forthe 5th Cheshire Regt who connected Beef Trench with Middle Copseand carried on two lines of trench in a northeasterly direction asfar as the rail or tram line companies of these pioneers alsoconnected the Copse with the southeast side of the QuadrilateralThis work resulted in a firm line some 900 yards in length facingBouleaux Wood and gradually working round ComblesPrisoners captured by the London Scottish while covering the diggingparties were from the 2nd Battalion 235th Regiment Reserve 51stDivisionThe right wing of the British Army had not yet reached the linedesired by Sir Douglas Haig Morval Les Bufs and Gueudecourt werestill in the hands of the enemy and on the right Combles still heldout at the junction of the Allied Armies An Allied attack from theSomme to Martinpuich was arranged for the 23rd September but theweather was so bad that it had to be postponed until the 25th [Thebattle of Morval]  [Illustration 2 GINCHY  MORVAL  THE BATTLES ON THE 9TH 15TH  25TH SEPR]The 168th Brigade were relieved by the 167th and obtained a littlerest from the night of the 22nd to the night of the 24th The battle      79front of the division was then the 169th Brigade on the right betweenLeuze Wood and Combles the 167th Brigade in Beef and Bully Trenchesand the 168th Brigade in the new trenches ready to attack BouleauxWood from the northwest or rather to envelop it as the wood was notto be enteredThe main task of the 56th Division was to continue building up theflank to neutralise the German detachments in Bouleaux Wood and toget touch with the 5th Division on the left The actual objectives ofthe 168th Brigade were some trenches between the northeast of thewood and the tramline also the bank and cutting of the tramlineThe 167th Brigade were to help by directing machinegun andtrenchmortar fire on the wood and the 169th Brigade by firing on thenorth and northeast exits of ComblesThe whole Corps attacked at 1235 pm and the German resistancecrumbled awayThe 4th London Regt on the right and the London Scottish on the leftadvanced under a most efficient enfilade artillery barrage Allobjectives were reached The 4th London Regt killed a large number ofHuns in shellholes round the north end of the wood and sufferedthemselves somewhat from enemy snipers in the southern part of thewood The London Scottish had some trouble and quite a stiff fight toclear the railway embankment during which the left company sufferedseverely But four machine guns were captured there and eightyprisoners These two battalions overran their objectives and curledround the end of Bouleaux WoodThe 5th 6th and Guards Divisions on the left swept through all their    80objectivesMorval and Les Bufs were capturedFor some time the London Scottish were out of touch with the 5thDivision which had swerved too far to the right but the completesuccess of the operations enabled the 56th Division to improve theposition round Combles By three oclock in the afternoon the 4thLondon Regt had two companies in the north end of Bouleaux Wood andboth the attacking battalions of the 168th Brigade had pushed outpatrols towards Combles Artillery observation officers reported toGen Hull that the enemy could be seen hurrying in small partiesfrom Combles in an easterly directionA steady pressure was kept on the Germans in Bouleaux Wood The centreof resistance here was round the derelict Tank on the left edge of thewood The 1st London Regt was on one side of the Tank and the enemyon the other On the right the London Rifle Brigade and the QueenVictorias Rifles gave the enemy no rest in the sunken road and thetrench leading to ComblesBy midnight the 168th Brigade had posts east of Combles the 167thBrigade had cleared the lower end of Bouleaux Wood and got behind theTank and the 169th Brigade had captured all of the sunken road trenchand the Combles trench And at dawn an officers patrol of the 168thBrigade had met a French patrol on the east of Combles The LondonRifle Brigade had already entered the town at 330 am and securedtouch with the French thereThe line desired by Sir Douglas Haig had been captured and there was amomentary pause The line held by the 56th Division at midday on the26th was some 1500 yards to the east of Combles The 167th Brigade       81were in the front line and in touch with the 5th Division and theFrench the 168th Brigade were a short distance in rear round aboutthe railway cuttings and the 169th Brigade were half in Combles andhalf to the west of it The Germans were some distance away holdingwhat was known as Mutton Trench in force and it was arranged that the168th Brigade should attack with the assistance of five Tanks But theTanks failed to put in an appearance and after waiting twentyfourhours the Rangers were told that the attack was cancelledMeanwhile our Allies on the right had captured Frigicourt and had thehard nut of SaillySaillisel to crack To assist them in securing thisvery important position Sir Douglas Haig agreed to hand over the lineas far as Morval so on the 28th the division was relieved and marchedfor a few days rest to the neighbourhood of VillesurAncre andMeaulte                                         The battle however still raged Sir Douglas Haig was pushing theenemy hard     The success of the Fourth Army had now brought our advance     to a stage at which I judged it advisable that Thiepval     should be taken in order to bring our left flank into line     and establish it on the main ridge above that village the     possession of which would be of considerable value in future     operations     Accordingly at 1225 pm on the 26th September before the     enemy had been given time to recover from the blow struck by     the Fourth Army a general attack was launched against     Thiepval and the Thiepval Ridge The attack was a     brilliant success On the right our troops reached the     system of enemy trenches which formed their objective     without great difficulty In Thiepval and the strong works           82     to the north of it the enemys resistance was more     desperate On the left of the attack fierce fighting in     which Tanks again gave valuable assistance to our troops     continued in Thiepval during the day and the following     night but by 830 am on the 27th September the whole of     the village of Thiepval was in our handsThe rest for the division however was not for very long Reinforcedthough hardly refreshed the brigades began to move back to the lineOn the 29th September the 167th Brigade was in Trones Wood west ofGuillemont and the 169th in a camp near by On the last night ofSeptember the latter brigade took over the line from the 6th Divisionwith the right in touch with the French while the 167th relieved the2nd Guards Brigade on the leftThe position taken over was outside Les Bufs in the trenches calledFoggy and Windy Battalions in line from the right were the QueensWestminsters Queen Victorias 1st Londons and the 7th MiddlesexThe orders were that they should send out patrols and occupy a line ofposts over the crest of the ridgethe 169th Brigade posts A B C Dand the 167th Brigade E F G H and KOn October 2nd the 167th Brigade reported having joined up a line ofposts but we cannot make the mapreadings given agree with what isknown of positions in subsequent events The country was more thanever devoid of landmarksit was just a wide expanse of shellholes ina dark brown almost black kind of earthand no one knew eithertheir own position or those of the enemy within a few hundred yardsand the few hundred yards were a matter of importance Anyhow the        83line was not the line of posts but probably near the line we havesketched on the left of 34 Touch was obtained with the 20th Divisionon the leftGen Hull was now instructed that the Fourth Army would renew theattack on the 5th October and that the XIV Corps would establishitself on a line from which the main Transloy defences could beattacked at a later date The 56th Division would capture HazyDewdrop Spectrum and part of Rainbow and establish a line along thewest crest of the ridge the Division would then as a second phase ofthe attack establish a line on the forward slope of the ridge fromwhich Le Transloy could be seen The General ordered that the 169thBrigade should attack on the right and the 167th Brigade on the left[The battle of the Transloy Ridges 1st18th October]The weather became steadily worse and though water is supposed to rundownhill and the division was on the slope of a hill the troops mightjust as well have been in the middle of a pond No one could move andthe operations were postponed for fortyeight hoursAssembly trenches were dug and patrols reported the enemy some 200yards on the farther side of the ridge The objectives for the attackwere well beyond the line of posts it had been hoped to occupy withpatrols and the 21st London and 11st Edinburgh Field CompaniesRE with two companies of the 5th Cheshire Regt were given to thetwo brigades to consolidate what was gainedThe assault took place at 145 pm on the 7th October and on theleft was fairly successful The 7th Middlesex on the extreme left       84and the left company of the 1st London Regt drove the enemy out ofthe northern half of Spectrum and part of Rainbow where they joinedwith the 20th Division The right company of the 1st Londons howeverwas held up by machinegun fire from Dewdrop and failed to reach thatend of SpectrumThe 168th Brigade fared badly on the right Three battalions attackedin linethe London Scottish the 4th London Regt and the RangersTwo machine guns were in the front line for covering fire and fourothers west of Les Bufs for indirect covering fire there were alsosix Stokes mortars in Burnaby to put a barrage on Dewdrop In somerespects the attack was peculiar As was so often the case thedirection of the attack was at an angle to our front and the LondonScottish starting the assault from the right at 145 pm werefollowed by the 4th London Regt at 147 and the Rangers at 149 pmthis was calculated to bring the three battalions into line by thetime Dewdrop and the gunpits were reachedThe leading company of the Rangers on the left was knocked outbefore it had gone fifty yards by machine guns in the northern end ofDewdrop and the reserve companies of the battalion came under a veryheavy barrage and did not succeed in carrying forward the attack Theremnants of this battalion lay out in shellholes until dusk whenthey returned to the original lineThe 4th London Regt in the centre met with much the same fate Theleft company was annihilated and the right company managing to reacha patch of dead ground lay down unable to move The rear waves weremet with intense artillery fire but advanced most gallantly to the       85line of the leading troops From the dead ground attempts were made tooutflank the gunpits from which the hostile machinegun fire wasdirected and small parties managed to work well round to the southThe London Scottish advanced well for about 400 yards and occupiedthe south gunpits and the southern end of Hazy The enemy at onceattempted a counterattack from the northern end but this was drivenoff But it was found that a wide gap existed between the right of thebattalion and the French who had attacked east instead of northeastand small parties of the London Scottish were successively pushed outto fill the gap and get touch At six oclock they had succeeded inestablishing a thin but continuous line in touch with our Allies Butthe situation was a very difficult one The enemy had receivedreinforcements in Hazy and the north gunpitsfrom all appearancesfresh troopsand both flanks of the London Scottish were in the airand exposed to the immediate presence of the enemyAt 830 pm the German counterattack developed and though heavycasualties were inflicted on the enemy he succeeded in forcing theLondon Scottish and the right of the 4th London Regt which wascreeping round the gunpits to retire to our original lineThe division at nightfall was left with a net gain of part ofSpectrum and Rainbow Gen Hull then ordered a renewal of the attackon the next day and sent up the London Rifle Brigade and the QueenVictorias Rifles to the 168th Brigade and the Queens WestminsterRifles to the 167th BrigadeThe assault took place at 330 pm on the 8th October and almost at     86once BrigGen Freeth reported that the barrage was very feebleOn the 168th Brigade front the attack was arranged this time so thatit started simultaneously all along the line The London Rifle Brigadeon the right advanced steadily for about 500 yards and again gained afoothold in Hazy But the experience of the previous day was repeatedThe northern gunpits with their garrison of machinegunners washeld by the enemy who poured a devastating fire into the left flankof the four advancing waves and on this occasion there was fire fromthe right flank as well the attack was in the main held up aboutfifty yards from Hazy where a shellhole line was established Thereserve company was sent forward to fill the gap which existed as onthe first attack between us and the FrenchThe Queen Victorias Rifles and the 3rd London Regt on the 167thBrigade front failed to make any appreciable advance Both Dewdropand the south of Spectrum resting on the sunken road were stronglygarrisoned and the machinegun fire was withering At 1030 pm alltroops were withdrawn to the original lineThe position on the morning of the 9th was that we held Spectrum tothe bend in the trench just south of the sunken road and had a strongparty of the Queens Westminsters in the sunken road On the remainderof the front there had been no advance  [Illustration 3 THE TRANSLOY RIDGE]On these two days 84 prisoners of the 31st and 84th Reserve InfantryRegts 18th Division and two machine guns were captured The greatdifficulty experienced was to know where troops were situated Theweather was bad and the effort of attacking was in itself a gigantic     87one but that effort had been made and seemed to hang on the brink ofsuccess and if the artillery could have helped a little more wouldhave been entirely satisfactory The artillery however were greatlyhandicapped Maps could not tell them where the new enemy trencheswere and aeroplanes were unable to take photographs As to beinghelped by roads though these were clearly marked on the map they hadbeen almost completely blown away by shell fire on the ground and wereby no means easy to distinguish It was a vile countryThe latter days of the Somme battle were even worse for the RAMCWounded men had to be carried to Ginchy and frequently from there toMontauban The medical branch of the division never experienced aharder time than that on the SommeOn the night of the 9th October the 56th Division was relieved by the4th Division The battles of the Somme were practically over SirDouglas Haig wanted to push on in the direction of Le Transloy     On our eastern flank  it was important to gain ground     Here the enemy still possessed a strong system of trenches     covering the villages of Transloy and Beaulencourt and the     town of Bapaume but although he was digging with feverish     haste he had not been able to create any very formidable     defences behind this line In this direction in fact we     had at last reached a stage at which a successful attack     might reasonably be expected to yield much greater results     than anything we had yet attained The resistance of the     troops opposed to us had seriously weakened in the course of     our recent operations and there was no reason to suppose     that the effort required would not be within our powers     This last completed system of defence before Le Transloy           88     was flanked to the south by the enemys position at     SaillySaillisel and screened to the west by the spur lying     between Le Transloy and Les Bufs A necessary preliminary     therefore to an assault upon it was to secure the spur and     the SaillySaillisel heights Possession of the high ground     at this latter village would at once give us far better     command over the ground to the north and the northwest     secure the flank of our operations towards Transloy and     deprive the enemy of observation over the Allied     communications in the Combles valley In view of the enemys     efforts to construct new systems of defence behind the Le     Transloy line it was desirable to lose no time in dealing     with the situation     Unfortunately at this juncture very unfavourable weather     set in and continued with scarcely a break during the     remainder of October and the early part of November Poor     visibility seriously interfered with the work of our     artillery and constant rain turned the mass of hastilydug     trenches for which we were fighting into channels of deep     mud The country roads broken by countless shell craters     that cross the deep stretch of ground we had lately won     rapidly became almost impassable making the supply of food     stores and ammunition a serious problem These conditions     multiplied the difficulties of attack to such an extent that     it was found impossible to exploit the situation with the     rapidity necessary to enable us to reap the full benefits of     the advantages we had gainedTwo attacks were indeed made to assist the French in theiroperations against the important village of SaillySaillisel whichfell to them on the 18th of the month but by that time the weatherhad become so bad and the delay had been so long that the decisivemoment had passed [The short and successful battle of the Ancre was      89fought on the 1318th November bringing the total number of 1916Somme battles up to twelve]                                         LieutCol A D Bayliffe who commanded the 168th Brigade throughthis great battle wrote at the time an interesting paper which heheads Lessons to be deducted from the Operations on the SommeWritten with the incidents and conditions fresh on his mind and forfuture guidance it is not a criticism of the actions fought but fromhis recommendations we may gather something of the difficulties whichhad to be faced and overcome We give only some striking extracts     The results of the operations carried out by this brigade     bear out more than ever the necessity for an assault being     made direct at the objective Failures or partial failures     are attributable to presentday troops being asked to     perform a complicated manuvre such as a wheel or change of     direction during an assault     The objectives allotted should be as far as possible     definite and should be chosen on the ground so that     welldefined landmarks may be included With the heavy     casualties which occur among the officers and considering     the partiallytrained state of NCOs and men it is seldom     any use leaving the site of the objective to the judgment of     the assaulting troops     In order to comply with this suggestion it is essential     that a proper scheme of assembly trenches should be thought     out and proper time given for their construction even in     the rapid advances which have been taking place     In this connection it should be remembered that troops     engaged in holding the line cannot be expected to do much            90     digging work Also that without further training     reinforcement officers are incapable of finding their way     over unknown ground even with good maps and that they     cannot tape out trenches and extend working parties It is     therefore necessary to use pioneers very largely for the     digging of assembly trenches if this essential work is to be     well done     Attacks delivered on too broad a front with too little     weight fail even against what appears to be inferior hostile     defences The reason is that assaulting troops edge away     from the source of hostile fire and when the lines of men     are too thin they move forward through the gaps in the     hostile defences without dealing with them     It appears that assaults to be successful should never be     delivered with less than four waves even against near     objectives One hostile machine gun may completely break up     the first wave or two if there are two or more waves in     rear they may successfully carry on the assault     It is desirable to have Battalion Headquarters as far     forward as possible right up in the front assembly trenches     if possible before an attack But it is no good placing     them there unless there is some suitable shelter however     small and unless time is available to lay communication     lines forward Brigade Headquarters should also be right     forward provided there is some accommodation This     facilitates personal reconnaissance and liaison     If the efficiency of a brigade is to be maintained as a     fighting unit through a period of several weeks of active     operations a far larger proportion of officers and men     should be left back than is customary The average     reinforcement officer is quite useless when his first     appearance on service is in the middle of a modern battle I     would suggest that a battalion should go into action with     from 12 to 16 officers only and that 4 to 8 more should be     kept about the line of Brigade Headquarters and the remainder       91     to be at the transport lines NCOs should be dealt with     in the same proportion     It is well borne out through these operations that if the     artillery barrage is good and the infantry advance close to     it they will probably reach their objective without heavy     loss Usually the standing barrage was put up behind the     objective and it is thought that the standing barrage     should be on the objective until the creeping barrage     coincides with it and then both move together to their next     standing line     On one occasion 7th October the three battalions of     infantry on this brigade front had to advance at different     times the consequence was that the last to move had to face     a very heavy barrage in addition to machinegun fire It is     thought that the infantry should always move at zero even     if they are not in line with each other and that the     barrage line should be made to conform with the line of the     assaulting infantry     As usual there was a complete lack of touch throughout the     operations with the heavy artillery It is thought that the     artillery group system should be extended so as to include     some heavy artillery     It is suggested that a large supply of signboards painted     white or luminous should be prepared for active operations     and also a supply of trench bridges  reliefs were often     much complicated and delayed by the lack of good tracks     The value of the Stokes mortars in the more open fighting we     have been having is very doubtful The results achieved have     never been commensurate with the great labour involved in     getting the guns and ammunition forward The trench mortar     from an administrative point of view is more trouble than     any other unit when frequent moves and reliefs occur as it     is not selfcontained and much work and trouble is involved     at very busy moments in devising how its stores are to be     moved     The Tanks allotted to cooperate with this brigade were not          92     found to be of any use at all It is thought that Tanks     require select crews of great determination and officers in     charge who have more experience and knowledge of the methods     of infantry and artillery in war If the speed of the Tanks     could be increased it would add very greatly to their     valueThe difficulties indicated in this paper were those which faced theactual fighting men We have already mentioned the zigzag line andthe reader will readily appreciate how the attempt to form a frontmoving in a given direction after the men had left the trenchesfrequently led to confusion and loss of direction Col Bayliffesstatement that men will edge away from the source of fire does notnecessarily contravert our assertion that they are drawn towards thesound of fire which must be read in conjunction with the admitteduncertainty of the exact position of an objective During an attack noofficer or NCO can control more than half a dozen men and the moreusual number is two On this basis the proportion of officers andNCOs is totally inadequate and it follows that success dependslargely on the men themselves The assaulting troops will fallnaturally under two heads leaders and followers The leaders are themen of greater initiative and in moments of uncertainty when doubtof their direction seizes them when no trench is visible they turntowards the sound of the enemythe place where the firing comes fromIt is one of the factors to be dealt with in keeping direction A linewhich has become thin through casualties will no doubt swerve from astronglyheld postAnd what a lot is covered by the paragraph on digging The physical       93effort required to go through a battle like the Somme was colossalRelief meant only relief from the actual front line not relief fromopen trenches from wet from mud from cold or even from severecasualties it was merely a case of moving a short way back to othertrenches After days of this sort of life an assault was a mostexhausting experience and if successful was not finished with thewritten message We are on our objective Exhausted men were calledupon to dig new trenches at once under fierce fire and the trenchesdug they waited for the counterattack which on the Sommeinevitably followed Perhaps the counterattack succeeded and the menwere driven back to their original lineand still there was no restImagine the condition of mind of the surviving officers and men of acompany when they were reinforced by troops straight from home withno experience of modern or indeed any other form of fighting Thereinforcements came almost as an added anxiety to the old men And howcould the new arrivals be expected to appreciate the advantage offollowing close on our own barrage in itself a doubtprovoking thingThere was nothing easy for the regimental officer or for his men theyfought the enemy the earth and the skyWe give the gallant colonels remarks on Tanks as an interesting lighton the early proceedings of the new engines of war We are well awarethat they will provoke a smile from some readers but they are nonethe less justifiable Tanks accomplished very little on this part ofthe battle front To the infantry they seemed only to attract theattention of the enemy with the appalling noise they made and the verydefinite target they afforded and then they broke down Col             94Bayliffes opinion which does not absolutely condemn the use ofTanks was shared by two BrigadierGenerals of the 16th Division andmost of the infantry in less exalted positions That they afterwardsaccomplished the object of their inventors is beside the pointHeaven forbid that we should appear to offer excuses for the 56thDivisionnone are needed But we find it impossible to give a truepicture of the conditions under which men fought and by placing a fewof the difficulties before the reader hope to enable him toappreciate the truly great fighting qualities of these London menSuccess conjures up to the mind a picture of swift movement and suchsuccesses were gained during the warbut not on the Somme The enemywas strong and determined and fought to the last Gen Falkenhaynwho was the instigator of the Verdun offensive seems to ratherpoohpooh the battle of the Somme and give the impression that it hadlittle effect on the Central Powers but as he was dismissed at theend of August one might deduce that other people did not share hisviews Hindenburg and Ludendorff on the other hand wag their headsgravely over the whole business The Germans were being badlybattered and were fighting most desperately to arrest disaster Andso in recording the exploits of the 56th Division we have to repeatsomewhat monotonously the account of attacks being continuallydelivered on the same trench or pointThe trouble in a battle of this sort is to reconcile the two points ofview that of the Higher Command and that of the infantry For theinfantry there was no break in the fightingif they did not assault      95over the top they were bombing the enemy out of a trench or beingbombed out themselves And it is not too easy to decide whatparticular trenches were held at any one moment The position in LoopTrench for instance was continually changing Combles Trench thesunken road and the southern end of Bouleaux Wood were points ofcontinual struggle The enemy exerted his full pressure on the 56thDivision But for the Higher Command this month of fighting dividesitself into five attacksThe plan on this part of the front was to surround Combles by joiningthe French on the far side The junction of two armies of differentnationalities might always be considered a point of weakness and themovement itself was one of which the enemy could take advantage LordCavan explains the position very clearly with a small rough sketch     The plan to take Combles was like this     [Illustration]     Therefore during the advance the protection of my flank from     a possible counterstroke down the arrow was most important         96     This protection from Leuze Wood to Morval was splendidly and     gloriously afforded Further in the actual attack on Morval     and Les Bufs this protecting flank had to be advanced to     keep pace with the attack The key of this was the capture     of a trench about XX This was captured and held and the     complete success of the battle was assured I had every     confidence in Hull and his men tired though they were and     this confidence was more than justifiedThis grim determined and desperate struggle reveals qualities in theLondon troops which though they existed would not in a morespectacular success have been so clearly demonstrated It requiresgood men to attack again and again until their object is gained andwhen these attacks are launched against such splendidly trainedsoldiers as the Germans one can only marvel that the thing was everdone and applaud the steadfast courage the endurance of body andspirit which enabled the men to do itTrue the battles of the Somme ended with both sides being stuck inthe mudan inglorious ending to so much heroismand the final andperhaps fatal stroke was snatched from our grasp by the weather butthose who came through the battle may now consider dispassionatelywhat it was they had accomplishedThe Central Powers we must always remember that we fought more thanthe strength of Germany had decided as we know to bleed Francewhite on the field of Verdun They were also pressing Italy hard andhad gained important successes The Entente Powers replied first withBrussiloffs attack and secondly with the FrancoBritish offensive onthe Somme Falkenhayn declares that the most dangerous moment of          97the Russian offensive had been passed before the first shot of thebattle of the Somme had been fired He also maintains that theAustrian loss of the right bank of the Isonzo had no connection withthe Somme that the Germans would not in any case have sent troops tohelp their ally in Italy As for Verdun he deals with it in asomewhat unsatisfactory paragraph     The only tangible gain then of this battle to the enemy     remains in its effect on the situation on the Western Front     As a matter of course an expenditure of strength such as     the enemy favoured demanded the use of corresponding forces     for the defence The operations in the Meuse area were not     yet however immediately affected On the 11th July we were     still able by a strong thrust to advance our line on the     east bank After this it was the tension of the whole     situation and especially the necessity to husband our     matriel and ammunition which necessitated the     abandonment of any big German offensive operations on the     Meuse The headquarters of the Crown Princes Army Group     were instructed to carry on the offensive calmly and     according to plan so as to give the enemy no good reason     for concluding that he could hope for its cessation This     too was quite successful for the French were unable to     bring up reinforcements from the Meuse to the Somme front     until September when following on the change of Chief of     the General Staff the Verdunoffensive had been     completely abandonedThe last sentence is of course the bitter pill for Falkenhayn It isperhaps only natural that he would seek to justify his policy andpersist that he was right and would have succeeded had he been leftalone Hindenburgs memoirs give one a somewhat different impression     98     Very soon after I took over my new post I found myself     compelled by the general situation to ask His Majesty the     Emperor to order the offensive at Verdun to be broken off     The battles there exhausted our forces like an open wound     Moreover it was obvious in any case that the enterprise had     become hopeless and that for us to persevere with it would     cost us greater losses than those we were able to inflict on     the enemy The battlefield was a regular hell and was     regarded as such by the troopsAnd of the Somme he says     The extent of the demands which were being made on the army     in the West was brought before my eyes quite vividly for the     first time during this visit to France I will not hesitate     to admit that it was only now that I fully realised all that     the Western Armies had done hitherto I could now     understand how everyone officers and men alike longed to     get away from such an atmosphere Many of our best and     finest fighting men had to pour out their hearts blood in     destroyed trenches     It was only when the arrival of the wet season began to make     the ground impossible that things became quieter in the     battle area of the Somme The million of shellholes filled     with water became mere cemeteries Over everyone hovered     the fearful spectre of this battlefield which for     desolation and horror seemed to be even worse than that of     VerdunGeneral Ludendorff carries the impression still further[3]     On the Somme the enemys powerful artillery assisted by            99     excellent aeroplane observation and fed with enormous     supplies of ammunition had kept down our fire and destroyed     our artillery The defence of our infantry had become so     flabby that the massed attacks of the enemy always     succeeded Not only did our moral suffer but in     addition to fearful wastage in killed and wounded we lost a     large number of prisoners and much material     The 25th saw the beginning of the heaviest of the many heavy     engagements that made up the battle of the Somme Great were     our losses The enemy took Rancourt Morval Gueudecourt     and the hotlycontested Combles On the 26th the Thiepval     salient fell     The fighting had made the most extraordinary demands both on     commanders and troops Divisions and other formations had     to be thrown in on the Somme front in quicker succession     and had to stay in the line longer The time for     recuperation and training on quiet sectors became shorter     and shorter The troops were getting exhausted Everything     was cut as fine as possible The strain on our nerves in     Pless was terribleWe may conclude then that the Somme as the chief counterstroke ofthe Entente Powers defeated the Central Powers France was not bledwhite and although the Russians were driven back and Roumania whohad entered the war was speedily defeated by the Central PowersItaly was relieved and delivered a successful counterattack on theAustrians The situation as a result of the Somme although theindividual British soldier may not have thought it vastly improvedwas more than ever serious for the Central Powers and one could notat that stage hope for moreThe total number of prisoners taken by the British Armies on the         100Somme from 1st July to 18th November was over 38000 Also 29 heavyguns 96 field guns 136 trench mortars and 514 machine guns     [3] My War Memories 19141918 Ludendorff                             CHAPTER III                                 101                         LAVENTIERICHBOURGOne might well imagine that the 56th Division was entitled to a restbut the days when armies retired into winterquarters hadpassedunless a quiet bit of the line may be so called There was arest for a few days in the neighbourhood of BelloysurSommenorthwest of Amiens Battalions moved there after a night atBernafay Wood Mansell Camp or the Citadel by bus and all moveswere complete by the 12th October Then they rested and cleaned upThere was a slight rearrangement on the 20th which brought DivisionalHeadquarters to Hallencourt and some of the units into othervillages but the division was once more on the move almostimmediately and on the 24th October was behind the 61st Division inthe country round Lestrem Three days later brigades commenced therelief of the 61st Division in the Richbourg lAvouLaventie lineThis bit of country was exceedingly flat and in normal times wasdrained by innumerable ditches It was one of those bits of countrywhere trenches are an impossibilitysoil and water seem to becombined in equal proportions Naturally war conditions did notimprove the draining and at times large tracts of the country wereflooded Our defences were breastworks and the system of holding the    102line was by a combination of posts There were certain advantagesabout this line matters of space and of easy approach but they wereonly apparent when the weather was fine when it was cold and wetshelter was very difficult to findAt first all three brigades were in line but on the 27th November the5th Division was put in on the right and the front was shortened sothat two brigades held the line and one was in reserveThe whole of the division however did not arrive in this sector atonce The artillery had been left on the Somme battlefield coveringthe left of the French Of this time BrigGen Elkington writes     During the whole of the month of October the heavy and     incessant rain had made the going so bad that it was almost     impossible to get vehicles up to the positions Improvised     ammunition carriers were made out of the baskets from the     ammunition wagons and for the last part of the operations     all ammunition rations and water went up on pack animals     It was most difficult to get material for dugouts up to the     guns and in consequence officers and men suffered a great     deal of discomfort The horses also suffered very much from     the constant hard heavy work The 56th Divisional Artillery     were relieved on the 31st October by the 8th Divisional     Artillery Owing to the heavy going the withdrawal of the     guns was a difficult job and one section of A280 which     got stuck in deep mud took two days to get out The 56th     Divisional Artillery marched from the Somme on the 1st     November badly in need of a rest and refit in the way of     clothes etc and on the 5th we arrived on the NeuvilleSt     Vaast front and went into the line covering the 3rd     Canadian Division facing the Vimy Ridge on the 6th The     headquarters of the artillery was established at Aubigny           103     where the headquarters of the Canadian Division under     MajorGen Lipsett were     From the 7th November to the 1st December we remained     covering the Canadian Division The sector was a very quiet     one but the batteries were very extended and it was a     matter of very long walks going round them as cars were not     allowed forward We were very well done by the Canadians     and the men were able to get reclothed and the horses     managed to pick up in the good stabling On the 1st     December the 56th Divisional Artillery was relieved by the     Canadian RFA and we marched to the Neuve Chapelle area     to cover our own divisionMeanwhile the 56th Division was covered by the 6th DivisionalArtilleryReinforcements for the shattered battalions were prompt and allmonthly strength returns show a good average of a thousand men forbattalions Horses remained steadily about 5100 although the numberfell during the battle of the Somme In actual numbers the divisionwas of average strength but the quality had suffered We find forinstance a record that a draft of over a thousand men arrived aboutthis period and that they had not been instructed in musketry Withall the will in the world such men were not of very great useProvision was made however for their instructionAlmost at once the reputation of this Neuve Chapelle front began tochange It had been considered a quiet bit of line with nothing muchhappening beyond mining and countermining On the 28th October theenemy opened a trenchmortar bombardment which Australian minersdeclared to have been the heaviest they had experienced during their     104stay in that line The system of holding the line by means of poststoo gave many opportunities for patrol work as it was a systemadopted by both sides The advantage of position as was so often thecase was with the Germans who were on the Aubers Ridge with betterobservation and drier groundThe month of November was a quiet month cold and wet No Mans Landwas flooded and patrols found it very difficult to move about as theycould not avoid splashing and consequent betrayal of their presenceOn the 30th November the enemy raided the 7th Middlesex who occupiedas part of their line a minecrater Major Emery was on the spot andwith two men drove them off They failed to secure identification Thenext day however we secured identification in the shape of a LieutSteinhardt 19th Bavarian Regt who was in charge of a patrol whichwas dispersed by one of our Lewisgun teamsan experience which thelieutenant found so bewildering that he lost his way and entered ourlines under the impression that they were his ownTwo lancecorporals Millar and Wodley of the 2nd London Regt alsosecured identification by chasing a German patrol of five men of whomthey killed one and the remaining four put up their hands These menwere of the 7th Bavarian Regt 5th Bavarian Division III BavarianCorpsThe policy of the XI Corps Gen Haking was to annoy the enemy on alloccasions and keep him always uneasy The month of December wastherefore devoted to most active patrolling and the enemy lines wereentered again and again only to be found empty There is only one        105record of finding the line occupied when the Queen Victorias Riflescaptured two prisoners The reason of course was the state of theground and it affords an interesting sidelight on the endurance shownby the men of the 56th Division as the trenches or rather defencesthey occupied were similar to those of the HunThe operations of the winter are in fact only of interest as showingthe endurance the determination and the spirit of the 56th DivisionThere was nothing in the nature of an attack or even a raid of anymagnitudeit was a matter of small parties of men resisting thefearful conditions of climate and penetrating with the greatestboldness into the enemy linesHaving ascertained that the enemy was not occupying his line butmerely patrolling it a more aggressive attitude was adopted from the1st January 1917 On the first day of the year snipers from thebattalions in line established themselves in the German front lineand remained there all day They had a few opportunities which theydid not missThe operations until the 14th January were carried out by battalionsof the 167th Brigade those between the 14th and 29th by the 169thBrigade Briefly they may be summarisedOn the night of the 3rd4th January 100 men of a new draft were takenacross No Mans Land in parties of six to visit the enemytrenches this was no easy matter on account of the state of theground On the same night two officers of the 3rd London Regtpenetrated almost to the enemy support lines when they were held upby deep waterOn the night 910th January four posts were established in the enemy     106front line and on the next night two moreOn the 14th a post known as Hampstead Heath was violently attacked bythe enemy in very superior numbers This post was held by the 7thMiddlesex and the men were so cold they could scarcely move theQueens Westminster Rifles were actually halfway across No Mans Landon the way to relieve them when the attack occurred This relief wasapparently driven back by trenchmortar barrage and machinegun fireThe 7th Middlesex men put up a fight but their Lewis gun was jammedand useless and they were forced out of the post One man was foundto be missing The record of this regiment is particularly fine andthey felt very acutely the taking of this prisoner by the enemy The7th Middlesex is one of the two Imperial Service Battalions of theTerritorial Force which existed at the outbreak of war It was thefirst battalion to leave the country and was sent to hold GibraltarIn March 1915 it arrived in France and was attached to the 8thDivision at La Gorguein this same area From the taking over of theline immediately after the battle of Neuve Chapelle it went throughmany engagements before joining the 56th Division and up to thistime in spite of all the attacks on the Somme it had only lost sixmen as prisoners Its casualties in France to date were 28 officersand 338 other ranks killed 35 officers and 763 other ranks woundedOn the morning of the 15th January another post called Bertha wasattacked under cover of a dense fog and after four men out of elevenhad been killed the post of the 1st London Regt was drivenoutbut two were taken prisoners Almost immediately however apatrol of the same regiment composed of four men left our front        107line and reoccupied the post and by noon our troops had restored theposition The enemy made another attack but were driven off Thispost evidently caused the Germans great annoyance as they attacked iton the night of the 1617th January and were again driven offFrom the 17th to the 20th the posts were bombarded by artillery andtrench mortars and on the 21st under cover of an intensebombardment the enemy succeeded in occupying Bertha Post Acounterattack was at once organised but it failed owing to twomachine guns which the enemy had brought up with them In the earlymorning our patrols discovered the enemy leaving it and it was againoccupiedDuring the night 22nd23rd January the enemy made an organised attemptto recapture all the posts After repeated attacks the garrison ofBertha Post was once more forced to retire and again reoccupied thespot in the early morningThe enemy shelled the posts all day on the 23rd and 24th on thelatter with a large percentage of lachrymatory shells which shellingwas followed by four separate attacks After handtohand and bombingfights they were driven offOn the evening of the 27th the enemy concentrated his artillery fireon Irma Post which until then had only received general attentionfrom him and succeeded in driving the garrison out We then drove theenemy out by artillery fire and the post was reoccupied by usOn the 28th the Army Commander Gen Horne directed that all theposts should be vacatedOne cannot consider these incidents only as small bickerings The       108artillery fire which the men had to face was remarkably accurate andvery fierce and there was also the weather At first No Mans Landwas a swamp or a lake and then a cold snap set in which wasparalysing to all who had to live in the open The men had no covereither from shell fire or the weatherthe posts were only a matterof shellholes on our side of the German breastworks and improvedwith the help of a shovel and a pick In face of these hardships thecourage and determination of the troops of the 56th Division neverfaltered although at one time Capt Newnham felt impelled to writethat although wiring has been much strengthened actualconsolidation is impossible owing to the frozen ground The garrisonfeel they are occupying shell traps Battalions are on the defensiveand not offensive and the moral of the men is suffering At thesame time our existing defences are falling into disrepair In spiteof this dictum the men succeeded after it was written in driving offfour severe attacks but it gives an indication of the desperateconditions under which the 56th Division carried out an aggressivepolicyAll this work drew from the Corps Commander a personal letter to GenHull     I should be glad if you would convey to the troops of the     division under your command my appreciation of the     operations they have carried out so successfully during the     last month in establishing posts in the German front line     and holding them in spite of heavy bombardments and hostile     infantry attacks     The effects of the operations are much greater than the     troops that took part in them are probably aware of They           109     have shown the enemy the offensive and enterprising spirit     displayed by our troops and have encouraged other British     formations to adopt similar tactics which will have a     farreaching effect     BrigGens Loch and Freeth who conducted the operations at     different periods when you were acting in command of the     Corps deserve credit for the determined manner in which     they continued the pressure against the enemy in spite of     serious opposition The various counterattacks by our     troops immediately delivered without waiting for any     further orders and simply adhering to the plan laid down by     you show a fine military spirit on the part of officers and     men of the battalions engaged     I was particularly pleased with the action of the scouts of     the 1st London Regt who went across No Mans Land in     daylight on the 14th January and with the prompt action of     B Company Queen Victorias Rifles under Capt Brand on     the night of January 22nd23rd when the posts were     attacked Also with A and B Companies of the London     Rifle Brigade under Lieut Prior and 2Lieut Rose who     held Enfield and Barnet Posts in the enemy lines on the     night of January 2425th when their posts were shelled with     lachrymatory shells and our men had to wear respirators     These posts were then heavily attacked and the supporting     platoons quickly traversed No Mans Land before the hostile     barrage was put down I am also glad that the artillery     support on all occasions throughout these operations has     been prompt and effective                               R HAKING LieutenantGeneral                                    Commanding XI Corps     3rd February 1917The division then settled down to more ordinary trench routine butthe active season was approaching                                         Although the first day of the new year seems to mark a definite break    110in time no such break was obvious to the British troops in France andBelgium Sir Douglas Haig was determined to seize every favourableopportunity to push the advantage that had been won at the battle ofthe Somme Between the Ancre and the Scarpe valleys the enemy was in avery pronounced salient A series of operations were undertakenagainst the flank of this salient commencing in November 1916 Itwas however necessary to wait on the weather and although somevaluable positions were captured real advance was not made untilJanuary when actions were won and ground gained at Beaumont HamelGrandcourt Miraumont Serre Gommecourt and Irles These successesopened the way for a big operation against the Le TransloyLoupartline The enemy then made his celebrated retreat to the HindenburgLine This line branched off from the original German defences nearArras ran southeast for twelve miles to Quant and then west ofCambrai towards St QuentinThe opening of the new year is a most interesting study The Germanswere beginning to feel the lack of men Their retreat was decided uponfor the purpose of shortening their line and avoiding a battle Theyknew it would require months of preparation before an army couldadvance to the attack across the wide area which they hadsystematically laid waste Here at least they reckoned on a breathingspace And in Germany itself the Hindenburg programme for productionwas coming into operationeverywhere they were carefully going overtheir resources and reorganisingEngland reached in 1917 the height of her fighting power as regards    111the number of divisions and this was known to the enemy So he waitedwith some anxiety for developments on the Western FrontThe Germans had started their unrestricted submarine campaign fromwhich they hoped to gain much benefit but on the other hand theywere nervous of Russiaand Russia complicated the situationLudendorff writes     How often had I not hoped for a revolution in Russia in     order that our military burden might be alleviated But my     desire had been merely a castle in the air Now it had come     true and as a surprise It felt as though a weight had been     removed from my chestThe revolution in Russia took place in March and so right at thebeginning of what promised to be an ominous year for the Germans theywere able by a stroke of fortune to save ammunition in the East andto transfer fresh divisions from the East to the West and let theirwornout divisions deal with the RussiansThe Entente Powers however had no reason to feel more thandisappointment as they dealt the Central Powers a blow by the captureof Baghdad and although they had no immediate support from Americathat country declared war on Germany as a result of the submarinepolicy adoptedThe 56th Division opened the new year in very fair strength as thefollowing return will

trench warfareafter January it must not be thought that the policy of aggressionhad been abandoned The enemy lines were constantly visited and foundon most occasions to be empty But the 13th London Regt theKensingtons secured five prisoners of the 13th Bavarian Regt andkilled about forty on one occasion and the London Rifle Brigadeobtained identification and killed three in a subsequent raid

    THE BATTLES OF ARRAS 1917     THE FIRST BATTLE OF THE SCARPE 1917THE THIRD BATTLE OF                    THE SCARPEMINOR ACTIONSThe Germans had commenced their retreat and we know that the BritishHigher Command had planned large movements On the 14th March the169th Brigade took over the front line between Achicourt and Agny tothe south of Arras with the 30th Division on the right and the 14thDivision on the left Two days after a number of fires were seen inthe enemy lines to the south The Hun was moving but patrols foundhim very alert on their immediate frontBrigGen Coke 169th Brigade went round his line on the 15th Marchand the diary notes that trenches in a shocking condition full ofmud and dirt It was a normal condition for trenches and one mightwell be excused for wondering if the Italians or the forces inSalonica fared any better in this respect Did they find mud on thetop of a real mountain Maybe their position was always in the valleyin the centre of a streamAs usual patrols were out on the night of the 17th the patrolling ofthe 56th Division is worthy of great praise and noticed nothing inparticular But some scouts of the 2nd London Regt lying close tothe enemy wire as dawn was breaking on the 18th came to theconclusion that the enemy line was not normal They investigated and     115found it empty This was promptly reported to the company commanderwho sent out strong fighting patrols and occupied the front lineOfficers in the line acted with the greatest promptitude Brigades oneither side were quick to follow the example of the 2nd London Regtand all Headquarters were buzzing with excitement although thesituation in view of what was happening farther south was notunexpectedBy midday the 2nd London Regt had occupied Beaurains The whole Corpswas ordered to advance the German second line was occupied and onthe left the 14th Division were in the third line The Corps order forthe advance however was cautious It pointed out the probability ofthe enemy withdrawing to a main line of defence Telegraph Hill andthe east half of Neuville Vitasse The 169th Brigade were to keeptouch with the enemy but BrigGen Coke must avoid becoming involvedin a serious engagement at presentBy the early morning of the 19th March patrols had established thefact that the enemy were indeed holding Neuville Vitasse and on theleft he was found at Tilloy the Harp Telegraph Hill and NiceTrench Troops remained in front of Neuville Vitasse and constructedadvance trenchesWe have pointed out the salient between the Ancre and the Scarpewhich was the result of the battles of the Somme and we havementioned the actions that had been fought on the right of thissalient in preparation to a bigger operation It was the intention ofSir Douglas Haig to attack the salient from both sidesthe Fifth Armyin the south operating on the Ancre Front and the Third Army about      116Arras The plan included the pinching off of the whole area and onthe north of the Scarpe the capture of the Vimy Ridge This latteroperation was the task of the First ArmySo far as the Fifth Army was concerned the German retreat had avoideda battle but on the Third Army front their retirement must belimited as the enemy had no intention of giving up the Vimy Ridge onour First Army front Indeed there was no retirement on the left ofthe VII Corps just south of Arras which was the flank of theHindenburg LineBut adjustments and new orders were necessary to meet the situationIt was most desirable to attract as many enemy troops to our frontbefore the French offensive was launched in the south and so theFifth Army was ordered to follow the enemy closely to the HindenburgLine where it would exert the greatest pressure and the Third andFirst Armies would with slight modifications of detail carry out theoriginal attack as planned on their frontThe VII Corps was the most affected The objectives of the Third Armyhad been Mercatel Hill 90 the German thirdline system from FeuchyChapel and the high ground about Monchy The effect of the enemywithdrawals on the VII Corps front was     to change our task from an attack in a southeasterly     direction from prepared positions to an attack in an     easterly and northeasterly direction from improvised     positions But the objects of the attack remain the same     that is to break through the enemys defensive line on the     right of the Third Army front to overrun all his defences     as far as the Green Line the far side of the Cojeul River     and to clear and hold the southern side of the gap which the        117     VI Corps advancing simultaneously with us will have madeThe VII Corps front was held by the 21st 30th 56th and 14thDivisions in line with the 50th in reserve On the right the 21stDivision had a very small rle allotted to it The first attack was tobe delivered by the 56th and 14th Divisions with the VI Corps on theirleft no German retreat had taken place here and gradually the 30thand then the 21st Divisions would take part in the advanceThe first phase of the planned attack gave to the 56th Division thetask of capturing Neuville Vitasse the 30th would conform on theright but even so would not approach the enemy main line and to the14th Division the piercing of the extreme left of the Hindenburg Lineand part of the Harp the 3rd Division VI Corps on the left wouldcapture TilloyThe second phase placed the right of the 30th Division on the south ofthe Cojeul River and in possession of St MartinsurCojeul and theleft through the Hindenburg Cojeul Switch Line while the 56th and14th would be in front of WancourtThe 56th and 14th Divisions were not to go beyond Nepal Trench as the30th Division pushing up from the southwest would cross their frontand passing entirely to the south bank of the Cojeul would joinhands with the troops of the VI Corps east of Guemappe The 21stDivision would contribute to the flank thus formed with its rightstanding fast on CroisillesAfter this Green Line as it was called there was the usual hopefulreference to a distant objective Cambrai and some talk of cavalryno doubt a necessary provision but one which nevertheless was         118greeted with hilarity One thing however seems very certain theGerman retreat caused very little inconvenience to the Third Army andnone at all to the FirstPreparations for the attack on the Third Army front were carried onswiftly The enemy made no further move but to the south where hehad many miles to go before reaching the Hindenburg Line he was stillbeing closely pursued by the Fifth Army By the 2nd April the generalline was Slency Jeancourt Ephy Royaulcourt Doignies MercatelBeaurains Between Slency and Doignies the enemy still held positionsin advance of the Hindenburg Line and minor engagements werecontinually taking place on this section of the frontOn the night of the 1st April the 167th and 168th Brigades relievedthe 169th Brigade in the front line The bombardment of the enemypositions commenced on the 4th and was carried on for five daysMeanwhile troops could study the country they were to attackWhile the 169th Brigade had been in the line training had beencarried on extensively by the other two brigades Some of theinstructions and arrangements are worthy of note For the men openfighting was the main practice Regimental officers were told that     it must be realised that the maintenance of forward     movement depends on the determination and power of direction     of sections platoons companies and battalions The habit     of digging a trench and getting into it or of waiting for     scientificallyarranged artillery barrages before advancing     must be discarded A slow advance will give time for the            119     German reinforcements to arrivethe greater the rapidity of     an advance the more is resistance likely to lessen A few     sticky company commanders may not only delay the whole     operation but by giving the enemy time to reinforce will     also cause unnecessary casualtiesWe quote this for comparison with other instructions given at a laterdate There is nothing new in it and nothing to criticise in it butman is a lover of precedent and trench warfare and failure to getthrough to open fighting was the precedent established for himVery interesting instructions were issued on the subject of signalsbetween infantry and artillery One of the most curious facts of thewar was the general lack of communication between attacking infantryand artillery True the infantryman in the front line is not alwaysin the best position to direct artillery fire but on the other handhe is frequently the only man who knows anything at all We learnedto our cost the excellence of the German control of artillery fireand though our artillery observation officers performed the mostgallant feats our method never seemed as good as that of the enemyThe instructions issued were in imitation of the German methodColoured lights were to be fired from any sort of pistol Green lightswere to mean open fire and white lights increase the range Thesewere the only signals to be employed either by the ForwardObservation Officer or by the infantry The plan does not appear tohave answered very wellThere were also definite instructions as to the strength of battalionsand the number of officers noncommissioned officers and men to be     120left out of the fight We must deal with that in another place merelynoting here that platoons were now made up of one rifle section oneLewisgun section one bombing section and one rifle grenade sectionand that a Divisional Depot Battalion was formed at Bouquemaisonwhere all details left out of the battle were sent The DepotBattalion ensured a number of trained reinforcements being availableWe have left the 167th and 168th Brigades looking at Neuville VitasseThe way to that heap of ruins seemed clear with the exception of astrong point Neuville Mill situated on the right and in a positionto enfilade the attacking troops On the 7th the 1st London Regtattempted to capture the place but found it well defended withmachine guns and failed It was decided to deal with it by means ofTanksThe attack launched by the Third and First Armies on the morning ofthe 9th April was on a front of fifteen miles from Croisilles to thenorthern foot of the Vimy Ridge It included between four and fivemiles of the Hindenburg LineThe 56th Division attacked with the 167th Brigade on the right havingthe 3rd London Regt and 8th Middlesex Regt in line with the 1stLondon Regt in support and the 7th Middlesex in reserve the 168thBrigade was on the left with the 13th and 12th London Regts in linethe 14th in support and the 4th in reserve The Edinburgh Field CoyRE less two sections were with the right brigade and the 513thField Coy RE less two sections one company of the 5th Cheshiresand two sections of the 193rd Divisional MG Coy with the leftbrigade As the whole success of the operation depended on the 14th      121Division the left brigade had to be prepared to make a defensiveflankhence the machine guns and pioneersThe method of attack was what was sometimes called leapfrog The twobattalions in line on each brigade front were to capture Pine Lane andNeuville Vitasse and then the supporting battalion would go throughthem and capture the second defence which was the Hindenburg orCojeul Switch In the case of the 167th Brigade the reservebattalion the 7th Middlesex were to carry on the game of leapfrogand capture Nepal TrenchThe weather up to this point had been fine but on the morning of the9th dark clouds rolled up bringing heavy showers The attack wasstarted by the Corps on the left The 56th Division moved to theassault at 745 amThe first phase of the attack was the capture of Neuville Vitasse The3rd London Regt on the right progressed welltwo Tanks worked onthis battalion front and dealt with the strong point NeuvilleMilland at 10 am had reached their first objectivethat is tosay they were in a position short of the Hindenburg Line The 8thMiddlesex Regt were delayed at first by uncut wire but soon enteredthe ruined village Just before reaching the site of the church theyfound themselves confronted by a pocket of determined Germans withseveral machine guns Working round the flanks of this pocketbombers and riflemen succeeded in enveloping the enemy so that justbefore eleven oclock sixtyeight survivors surrendered with fourmachine guns The battalion then cleared the rest of Neuville Vitasse    122and were in touch with the 3rd London RegtThe Kensingtons swept through the enemy front line with littleopposition and soon reached Moss Trench Their reserve companyseeing that all was well moved south into the village and renderedsome assistance to the 8th MiddlesexOn the extreme left of the divisional line the 12th London Regtafter going through the first line met some uncut wire which delayedthem but soon after ten oclock they were in touch with theKensingtons in Moss Trench although their left was thrown back owingto the right of the 14th Division being held up by uncut wireOf the two Tanks on the 168th Brigade front which were supposed towork round the north of the village only one ever started and verysoon that one was on fireMeanwhile the artillery the 281st 293rd and C Battery of the232nd Brigades had moved across the old German line and takenpositions about a thousand yards west of Neuville Vitasse by tenoclock It will be noticed that the artillery was grouped againEverything was therefore ready for the assault on the northernextremity of the Hindenburg Line and an advance to Nepal TrenchThis as we have said was to be done by the 14th and 1st LondonRegts who were the supporting battalions to each brigadeThe general plan at this point was that the 14th and 56th Divisionsshould attack simultaneously and the 30th Division on the right wasto follow in echelon Not until the 7th Middlesex Regtwhich was inreserve to the 167th Brigade and was detailed to attack and capture     123Nepal Trench after the Hindenburg Line had been made securehadpassed Neuville Vitasse was the 30th Division to move As the fightingon this right flank of the 56th Division was the most severe we willdeal first with the left flankThe attack started at 1210 pm and the London Scottish passingthrough the Kensingtons and 12th London Regt were soon engaged insome lively fighting which lasted about two hours They killed anumber of the enemy captured 100 of them and one machine gun andoverran the mass of trenches by 1000 yards On their left they werein touch with the 14th Division but their right was in the air Asthe 167th Brigade had not progressed so well the London Scottishposition was not too goodOn the right of the 56th Division the situation was obscure The 30thDivisiontimed to advance after the 167th Brigadehad failed andthis failure enabled the enemy in Egg and the adjacent trenches togive their undivided attention to the flank of the 56th Division Theattack was held upGen Hull had foreseen strong opposition in this direction and hadgiven BrigGen Freeth the 4th London Regt the reserve battalion ofthe 168th Brigade and the Queen Victorias Rifles from the 169thBrigade So when it was seen that the 1st London Regt had failed tomake progress the 7th Middlesex and 4th London Regts were launchedSome progress was made but casualties were heavy and the positionremained uncertain and enveloped in a fog of rumourIn order to give more stability to the line BrigGen Loch 168thBrigade ordered the Kensingtons forward into that part of theHindenburg Line which the London Scottish had captured and the latter   124battalion to withdraw from their forward position and reorganiseThe situation at 6 pm is shown A on mapBut the 14th Division on the left ordered an assault of the WancourtLine at 645 pm which attack owing no doubt to the situation onthe 56th and 30th Divisional fronts failedSoon after ten oclock that night 9th April the Corps ordered theassault of the Wancourt Line to take place at eight the followingmorning but Gen Hull pointed out that fighting was still going onthat the situation would not be clear until daylight and that hisdivision would not be able to attack at that hour The order wastherefore amended so that the attack should take place when thesituation on the 56th and 14th Divisional fronts was clearIn the darkness of the night the 167th Brigade troops bombed theGermans out of all of the Hindenburg Line on their front but theywere still giving much trouble from the 30th Division area The LondonScottish were now able to advance again on the left and get in touchwith the 14th Division about 15The position did not seem too favourable unless something was done onthe right but at 1045 am the Corps issued a more ambitious orderthat the attack was to be carried on to the east of GuemappeAt midday the attack was launched but now the whole direction wasaltered The left of the line advancing on Wancourt was held up andthe right in order to get elbow room was forced to clear theHindenburg Line on the 30th Division front In this maze of trenchesthe 167th Brigade made steady progress towards the junction of theHindenburg and Wancourt Lines This was good work and the Corps         125ordered the occupation of Hill 90 on the far side of the WancourtLine Gen Hull however informed the Corps that it could not be donethat nightOn the left the position was as uncertain as it had been the previousday on the right The 14th Division claimed to be in the WancourtLine and eventually it was found that they had swerved to their leftand created a large gap between their right and the left of the LondonScottish who were lying out in the openSo the situation B remained through the night The next daythe 11th nothing was done on the left of the line but the 167thBrigade carried on their good work and the Queen Victorias Riflescleared the Hindenburg Line as far as the Cojeul River and a longlength of Nepal Trench which was part of the Wancourt Line Thedifficulty of the 30th Division was apparently uncut wire They seemedto be stuck facing the Hindenburg Line while the Queen VictoriasRifles cleared it A Corps telegram to this division reads     Not satisfied that the infantry are receiving sufficient     support from the artillery The situation demands that as     many batteries as possible be pushed forward so that enemy     machine guns be dealt with at decisive rangeThe 167th were relieved by the 169th Brigade late in the afternoonafter three days of very severe and successful fightingThe 169th Brigade were ordered to consolidate Hill 90 and to pushpatrols into Heninel and later when the 30th Division had occupied     126the Hindenburg Line to cross the River Cojeul and make good the highground to the southThe attack ordered started at 515 am on the 12th and after stiffbombing fights the 2nd and 5th London Regts working to the northand south of Hill 90 joined hands on the other side of it It wasfound necessary during this operation to have a password so thatconverging parties should not bomb each other To the great amusementof the men the words Rum jar were chosen The Germans being bombedfrom both sides must have thought it an odd slogan The enemy werethen seen withdrawing from Heninel and the leading company of the 2ndLondon Regt immediately advanced and occupied the village The 30thDivision then crossed to the south of the Cojeul River and madeprogress along the Hindenburg Line Meanwhile the 2nd London Regt hadpushed forward patrols and occupied the high ground to the east ofHeninel where they got in touch with the 30th DivisionThe occupation of Hill 90 which had been made possible by the 167thBrigade and the Queen Victorias Rifles attached also caused theenemy to vacate the village of Wancourt which was entered by patrolsof the London Rifle Brigade about eleven oclock The 14th Divisionmoved two battalions one on either side of the village with a viewto continuing the advance to the high ground east of the Cojeul Riverand at 1 pm the Corps ordered the advance to be continued to theSense River but these orders were modified and the 56th Division wastold to consolidate C and prepare for an advance on the 13thOn the 13th April nothing much was done The 56th Division held the      127ridge from 35 to Wancourt Tower on the right the 33rd Division whichhad relieved the 30th failed to advance on the left the 50thDivision which had relieved the 14th on the preceding night alsofailed to advance having been held up by machinegun fire fromGuemappe But the Corps ordered a general advance on the next day theobjective being the line of the Sense RiverDuring the night the enemy blew up Wancourt Tower which seemed tosuggest that he was contemplating retirement At 530 am our attackwas launched but almost at once the 169th Brigade reported that theQueens Westminster Rifles had gone forward with no one on their leftAbout five hundred yards in front of them were some practice trencheswhich the enemy had used for bombing Capt Newnham writes of theattack dissolving about the line of these trenches ApparentlyGuemappe had not been taken on the left and a perfect hail ofmachinegun fire enfiladed the advancing troops from this village TheQueen Victorias Rifles who attacked on the right met with no betterfate the leading waves being wiped out From the diary of 169thBrigade we learn that     the 151st Brigade attack on our left never developed     leaving our flank exposed Enemy met with in considerable     strength they had just brought up fresh troops and the     allotment of machine guns according to prisoners was two     per battalion The 151st Brigade attack was ordered with     their left flank on Wancourt Tower which was our left and     the dividingline between brigades Great confusion     consequently on our left front where two battalions of     Durhams were mixed up with the Queens Westminster Rifles     and the London Rifle Brigade moving up in support added to        128     the congestion Casualties were heavyQueens Westminster     Rifles 12 officers 300 other ranks Queen Victorias     Rifles 15 officers and 400 other ranksThe attack had not however dissolved at all points as a thin lineof troops undoubtedly advanced a thousand yards and more beyond thepractice trenches But these gallant fellows soon found themselves ina very lonely position and as the 30th and 50th Divisions failed tomake any ground at all they had Germans practically on all sides ofthem They remained for some time and eventually withdrewThe next two days the 15th and 16th were occupied in consolidatingthe ground gained The division had alarms of counterattack butnothing developed on their front On the left however the enemyattacked and recaptured Wancourt Tower from the 50th Division Thispoint was not retaken by us until the next day but the 56th Divisionwere not concerned Further advance was postponed until the 22ndApril and on the 18th the 30th Division took over the line from the56th DivisionThis was the opening battle of the Arras series and is known as theFirst Battle of the Scarpe 1917 and is linked up with the Battle ofVimy Ridge The student would do well to consider the two battles asone The capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadians and of Monchy bytroops of the Third Army gave us positions of great importance andimproved the situation round Arras The feeling of the 56th Divisionwas that it had been a great fight and that they had provedthemselves undoubtedly better men than the Germans The capture ofNeuville Vitasse and subsequent rolling up of the Hindenburg Line to     129the south of Heninel was a feat of which they felt proud And they hadkilled a lot of the enemy at close quartersIt is an interesting battle as it undoubtedly inflicted a terrifyingdefeat on the enemy Ludendorff says of it[4]     The 10th April and the following days were critical The     consequences of a break through of 12 to 15 kilometres wide     and 6 or more kilometres deep are not easy to meet In view     of the heavy losses in men guns and ammunition resulting     from such a break through colossal efforts are needed to     make good the damage A day like 9th April threw all     calculations to the winds Many days had to pass before a     line could really be formed and consolidated The end of the     crisis even if troops were available depended very     largely as it generally does in such cases on whether the     enemy after his first victory would attack again and by     further success aggravate the difficulty of forming a new     line Our position having been weakened such victories were     to be won only too easilyHindenburg also confesses to very anxious moments and suggests thatthe English did not seem to have known how to exploit the successthey had gained to the fullIn his dispatch on this battle Sir Douglas Haig said that     With the forces at my disposal even combined with what the     French proposed to undertake in cooperation I did not     consider that any great strategical results were likely to be       130     gained by following up a success on the front about Arras     and to the south of it beyond the capture of the objectives     aimed at It was therefore my intention to transfer my     main offensive to another part of the front after these     objectives had been secured     The front selected for these operations was in Flanders     They were to be commenced as soon as possible after the     Arras offensive and continued throughout the summer so far     as the forces at my disposal would permitIt must be remembered that the plans for the year were drawn up inconsultation with our Allies and the battles of Arras must be takenas a part only of those plans The First and Third Armies securedpositions which Sir Douglas Haig intended that they should securethey inflicted great loss on the enemy more than 13000 prisoners andover 200 guns they drew German reserves until at the end of theoperations there were twice as many enemy troops on that front as atthe beginning which materially helped our Allies who were on thepoint of launching a big offensive on the Aisne and in Champagne Onthe whole these battles fulfilled their object and may be viewed withsatisfactionOn the 16th April the French attacked the ChemindesDames northwestof Rheims and in the Champagne south of Rheims They met with veryheavy losses and most obstinate resistance These were themuchdiscussed operations under Gen Nivelle and in order to assistSir Douglas Haig agreed to continue the operations round Arras longerthan was his first intention Plans which had been made for arearrangement of artillery and troops for the operations at Ypres       131were cancelled and orders were issued for a continuance

SouastreDivisional Headquarters were first at Couin and then at Hauteville Onthe 25th Gen Hull was ordered to hold himself in readiness to moveinto either the VI or the VII Corps and the next day was definitelyordered into the VI Corps On the 27th the 167th Brigade relieved the15th Division in the front line and Divisional Headquarters opened inRue de la Paix Arras                                         From the Harp which it will be remembered was the original line toeast of Monchy there runs a ridge of an average height of 100 metresat Monchy itself it rises above 110 metres This ridge shoots out anumber of spurs towards the Cojeul River to the south The positiontaken over by the 167th Brigade was from a small copse southeast ofMonchy to the ArrasCambrai road about 500 yards from the Cojeul andon the reverse slope of one of these spurs Observation for them was     132bad and the enemy trenches were well sited and frequently over thecrest of the hillOn the 29th the 169th Brigade took over the right of the line from the167th The front line was then held by the London Rifle Brigade the2nd London Regt the 1st London Regt and the 7th MiddlesexRegiment The Queen Victorias Rifles were in support of the QueensWestminster Rifles in reserve to the right brigade and the 3rd LondonRegt in support and the 8th Middlesex Regt in reserve to the leftbrigadeWith a view to the important operations which the French were to carryout on the 5th May it was decided to attack on an extended front atArras on the 3rd While the Third and First Armies attacked fromFontainelesCroisilles to Fresnoy the Fifth Army launched an attackon the Hindenburg Line about Bullecourt This gave a total front ofover sixteen miles [The Third Battle of the Scarpe 1917]Zero hour was 345 am and in the darkness illumined by waveringstarshells fired by a startled enemy and with the crashing of thebarrage the men of the 56th Division advanced from their assemblytrenches As soon as the first waves topped the crest they were metwith a withering machinegun and rifle fire The ground was confusingand the darkness intenseofficers as was so often the case in nightattacks found it impossible to direct their men Exactly whathappened will never be known in detail No reports came in for aconsiderable timeWith daylight the artillery observation officers began to communicatewith headquarters Our men they said had advanced 1000 yards on       133the right and were digging in near a factory Rohart on the bank ofthe Cojeul and the 14th Division on their right seemed to havereached its objectives About 300 yards over the crest of the spur wasa trench known as Tool and this seemed to be occupied by the enemySoon after this the 169th Brigade reported that the London RifleBrigade were holding a pit near the factory and a trench about thesame place the 2nd London Regt had a footing in Tool Trench Thelatter position is doubtful but the 2nd Londons were well forwardCavalry Farm near and to the right of the original line was stillheld by the enemy and about 10 oclock the Queen Victorias Riflesafter a short bombardment by the Stokes mortars rushed and securedthe farm They found a number of dugouts which they bombed andsecured 22 prisoners The farm was connected with Tool Trench andthey proceeded to bomb their way up it It would appear thereforethat the 2nd London Regt held a small section of this trench fartherto the north if any at allWe must now follow the 167th Brigade on the left The two attackingbattalions had been met with even worse machinegun fire than the169th Brigade There was no news of them for a long time It is clearthat neither the 1st London Regt nor the 7th Middlesex ever held anyof Tool Trench but a few gallant parties did undoubtedly overrunTool and crossing a sunken road known as Stirrup Lane reachedLanyard Trench quite a short distance from the men of the LondonRifle Brigade who had lodged themselves in the pit near RohartFactory They were however not in sufficient numbers to join hands     134with the London Rifle Brigade or some small groups of the 2nd Londonwho were also in advanced shellholes and about 8 oclock in theevening were forced to surrender A small party was seen marchingeast without arms The remaining 1st London and 7th Middlesex men layout in shellholes in front of Tool TrenchSoon after the Queen Victorias Rifles had captured Cavalry Farm andstarted to bomb up Tool Trench with the forward artillery and trenchmortars helping them the 3rd Division on the left of the 56thdeclared that their men were in the northern end of Tool They askedthat the artillery should be lifted off the trench as they were goingto bomb down towards the Queen Victorias Rifles But it appears thatthey were very soon driven out as by 3 pm the 3rd Division weredefinitely reported to be in touch with the 7th Middlesex in theoriginal lineMeanwhile the 14th Division on the right which had made goodprogress at the start had been violently counterattacked and at1150 am reported that they had been driven back to their originallineBrigGen Coke of the 169th Brigade now found his men in a queerposition The troops on either flank of his brigade were back in theline they had started from he ascertained that none of his brigadewere north of the ArrasCambrai road and so he held a long tongue inthe valley of the Cojeul open to attack from the high ground on eitherside of it  [Illustration 4 THE BATTLES OF ARRAS 1917]  [Illustration 4 THE BATTLES OF ARRAS 1917]Much movement by the enemy was observed during the afternoonreinforcements were assembling in Tool and the sunken road behind itAbout 10 oclock in the evening the Germans started a fierce             135bombardment of the tongue of land held by the London Rifle Brigadesand 2nd London Regts and after an hour of ceaseless firecounterattacked and drove the troops back to their original linesGen Hull then ordered them to hold their original line andreorganise but before the orders could reach them these two finebattalions had attacked again and reoccupied all the positions theyhad gained in the morning with the exception of Cavalry Farm But theywere in a bad situation With the enemy holding the Cambrai road inforce the only communication with the advanced troops was down thebottom of the valley a place of much water and mud BrigGen Coketherefore withdrew his men just before sunrise They brought withthem however a German officer and 15 men who had surrendered in theneighbourhood of Cavalry FarmIt had been a day of very hard fighting and the gain on the whole ofthe sixteen miles of front attacked was Fresnoy which had been takenby the Canadians and a portion of the Hindenburg Line east ofBullecourt captured by the Australians The enemy had been terriblyfrightened by the successful start of the battles of Arras Hindenburgand Ludendorff were putting into effect their new system of holdingthe front in depth but thin in the forward zones with many machineguns and strong supports for immediate counterattack It seemed asthough their system had broken down at the first test and as theRussians were no longer a menace to them they poured reinforcementsacross Germany But as we know this continuation of the offensivewas with the object of helping our Allies by holding troops and guns     136which might otherwise have been used against themThe 167th and 169th Brigades held the line for one day more and wererelieved by the 168th on the 5th May The latter brigade also tookover a stretch of extra line to the northThe enemy was exceedingly quiet and our patrols very active If anyindication is wanted of the high moral of the 56th Division it canbe found in this patrol work After an action of this kind when thetwo brigades lost just on a thousand men really audaciousreconnoitring deserves the highest praise Again and again attemptswere made by patrols to enter Tool Trench only to find the enemyalert Cavalry Farm on the right and the copse on the left wereboth entered and found unoccupied but the exact position of the enemyin Tool Trench was ascertainedMeanwhile the heavy artillery kept up a steady fire on Tool Trenchcausing large numbers of Germans to run over the open and seek saferground And troops worked hard on our trenches which were greatlyimprovedAt 830 pm on the 11th May the 4th London Regt on the right and theLondon Scottish on the left attacked Cavalry Farm and the trench onthe far side of it and Tool TrenchA practice barrage on the previous day had drawn heavy fire in a fewminutes and it had been decided not to have a barrage but to keepthe heavy artillery firing steadily to the last minute The enemy whoheld the line in full strength were taken by surprise Only CavalryFarm was visible from our line and the 4th London Regt swept intothis place with no difficulty But the right of the enemy line was       137able to put up a fight and the left company of the London Scottishsuffered somewhat severely Except for this one point the trench wasvacated by its garrison in a wild scramble They could not howeverescape the Lewis gunners and brigade machinegunners who did somegood execution Quite a lot of the enemy were killed in the trench anda round dozen taken prisonerthey were of the 128th Infantry Regtand the 5th Grenadier Regt Eight machine guns were also foundTool Trench was only a part of the enemy line which ran up the hill onthe east of Monchy To the south of the copse it was Tool and to thenorth it was Hook The very northern end of Tool and all of Hookremained in the hands of the enemy A block was made by filling inabout forty yards of the trench and the new line was consolidatedThe new line had been much damaged by our fire but it was soonreconstructed and two communication trenches were dug to the oldline Meanwhile the trench mortars kept up a steady bombardment ofHook Trench and snipers picked off the enemy as he attempted to seekthe safer shellholes in the openDuring the next few days several deserters from the 5th GrenadierRegt came in and they in common with other prisoners persisted instating that the enemy was contemplating a retirement Patrolshowever always found Lanyard Trench and Hook fully garrisoned The167th Brigade had taken over the line from the 168th and the 8thMiddlesex attempted to rush both Lanyard and Hook this was not donein force but was more in the nature of a surprise by strong patrolsThey found the enemy too alertOn the 19th something in the nature of an attack in force was carried    138out The 8th Middlesex made a night attack in conjunction with the29th Division on Hook Trench and the support line behind it TheMiddlesex men gained the junction of Hook and Tool but were verybunched the 187th Brigade on the left made no progress at all Itis probable that the Middlesex were more to the left than theyimagined as they were heavily bombed from both flanks and eventuallyforced to withdrawOn the 20th May the weary troops of the 56th Division were relieved bythe 37th DivisionIn these actions and in the battle on the 3rd May the objectives wereshallow and the enemy fully prepared to resist with largereinforcements of men and guns in the field The enemy barrage wasconsidered the heaviest that had as yet been encountered Thepositions attacked were well sited and frequently masked and therewas also the complication of night assaults at short noticeBrigGen Freeth in an interesting report of the battle on the 3rdsays      Owing to the darkness it was extremely difficult for     the assaulting troops to keep direction or the correct     distances between waves The tendency was for rear waves to     push forward too fast for fear of losing touch with the wave     in front of them Consequently by the time the leading wave     was approaching Tool Trench all the rear waves had     telescoped into it Even if Tool Trench had been taken much     delay would have been caused in extricating and moving     forward waves allotted to the further objectivesAnyone who has taken part in a night attack will appreciate thesedifficulties If it goes well it is very well but if not theconfusion is appallingThe casualties from the 29th April to 21st May were 79 officers and      1392022 other ranksThe general situation was that on the 5th May the French had deliveredtheir attack on the ChemindesDames and achieved their object but onthe whole the French offensive was disappointing On the Britishfront however 19500 prisoners and 257 guns had been captured andthe situation round Arras greatly improved The spring offensive wasat an endBut fighting did not cease round Arras and over the width of the sixtysquare miles of regained country The Messines attack in the north wasin course of preparation and the orders to the Fifth Third andFirst Armies were to continue operations with the forces left tothem with the object of keeping the enemy in doubt as to whether theoffensive would be continued Objectives of a limited nature were tobe selected and importance given to such actions by combining withthem feint attacks They were successful in their object but therewas bitter with the sweet as Sir Douglas Haig writes     These measures seem to have had considerable success if     any weight may be attached to the enemys reports concerning     them They involved however the disadvantage that I     frequently found myself unable to deny the German accounts     of the bloody repulse of extensive British attacks which in     fact never took placeThe attack on Messines was launched on the 7th June and was acomplete success With the first crash of our concentrated artillerynineteen mines were exploded and our troops swept forward all alongthe line By the evening 7200 prisoners 67 guns 94 trench mortars    140and 294 machineguns had been capturedThe 56th Division indulged in a little wellearned rest We read ofsports and horse shows in the vicinity of Habarcq of concerts givenby the Bow Bells concert party formed in 1916 at Souastre anddiaries have the welcome entries troops resting as the only event ofthe day But this was not for long Battalions were soon back in theline though much reduced in strength For the first time we find inspite of reinforcements that the average strength of battalions fellto just over eight hundredThe 169th Brigade lost Capt Newnham who went to the New ZealandDivision as GSO2 He instituted a form of official diary which is adelight to readconcise but with occasional reflections of a dryhumorous nature Capt Carden Roe from the 29th Division took hisplace as Brigade MajorDuring the 9th 10th and 11th of June the division relieved the 61stDivision in the line The position was the sameTool Trench from thecopse on the left to Cavalry Farm but it was extended to WancourtTower on the rightThe front now held measured 2700 yards Wancourt Tower was on thesummit of the high spur which runs parallel to the Cojeul River on thesouth bank The line can then be visualised stretching across thevalley with right and left flanks of the division on the high groundon either side of the river From the right good observation wasobtained over the enemy lines on the left of the divisional front andfrom the copse on the left of the line similar observation could behad over the enemy on the rightThe 3rd Division was on the left of the 56th and on the 14th June at   141730 am the former launched an attack on Hook Trench The attackwas a complete success the division came level with the 56th andcaptured 175 prisonersThe right of the 56th Division was held by the Queens WestminsterRifles and a few minutes after five oclock in the evening sentriesnoticed enemy movement behind a wood Bois du Vert which was oppositethe 3rd Division and on the left flank of the 56th Careful watchingrevealed the massing of troops A warning was sent over the telephoneThe 76th Brigade immediately on the left of the 56th Division wasinformed as was the artilleryKilling human beings is not dear to the heart of Englishmen Greentroops would stand violent shelling merely looking a bit tense aboutthe face but although they saw their comrades fall shattered topieces or badly wounded they would sometimes show a greatdisinclination to fire on Germans walking in the open behind the enemylines It seemed as though the idea was that the particular German inquestion was not trying to injure themhe might have been carrying aplank or a bag of rationsand so they would watch him and no onewould attempt to shoot unless there was an old soldier with them Thisframe of mind however did not last longBut the evening of the 14th June was an occasion for glee The Hun wasgoing to attack and all was ready for him At 530 the grey waves leftthe enemy trenches and at once a storm of artillery machinegun andrifle fire met them The Queens Westminster Rifles of course couldnot fire but they watched the action with great joy and kept Brigadeand Divisional Headquarters informed of every enemy move The attack     142was smashed up and thanks to the Queens Westminster Rifles theenemy was chased out of sight by the artilleryAfter this costly lesson the Germans tried a night attack on the 16that 230 am This time they succeeded in entering two posts but the3rd Division drove them out and the men of the 56th inflicted heavycasualties from the flankNothing more was done in this line beyond some skirmishing round apost The division was relieved on the 4th July and moved to the LeCauroy area                                         We have said very little about the Divisional Artillery but to followthem too closely in these engagements would lead to confusion Theysupported the 56th Division during the battle of Arrasin theoriginal schemeand when the division moved on the 20th April theartillery remained where it was BrigGen Elkington writes     The 56th Divisional Artillery remained in the line in this     sector under different CRAs and covering different     divisions and were not under my command again until the end     of May as I remained with the 56th Division and commanded     the artillery covering them All the divisional artilleries     became much mixed up and very few of the CRAs had their     own artillery under their own command     On the 24th May the division moved to the Habarcq area and     remained there until the 9th June I established the RA     Headquarters at Beaumetz so as to keep in touch with our     artillery who were still in the line At the end of May I     got four days leave and went to Paris with Hawkes     Jorgensen and Robinson and we were joined there by Cols     Groves and Lemon We all had an excellent time and                 143     enjoyed it immensely On the 5th July the 56th Divisional     Artillery returned to my command and we started to march to     the Ypres area and arrived at Oudezeele on the 13th July     1917 This was a very clean and comfortable village and all     ranks were well billeted We remained there until the 28th     July a very pleasant and wellearned rest for both officers     and men beautiful weather and many sports were organised     for officers and men Several fatigue parties had to be     furnished to assist the heavy artillery in the supply of     ammunition and these had very hard work and some     casualties During the later part our trench mortar     batteries under Capt Robinson went into the line with the     Guards Division and had rather a strenuous time doing     excellent work On the 9th July I went home on ten days     leave and I got married on the 12th JulyAt one period of the war it was thought that the artillery had asoft time but as the war progressed it was seen that the zone whichincluded the lighter guns included also conditions which rendered thecomfort of artillerymen scarcely more enviable than that of theinfantry We shall soon be able to throw a little more light on thework of this very gallant arm of the Service     [4] My War Memories 19141918                             CHAPTER V                                   144                               YPRESOn the 2nd July a rearrangement of the front had placed the 56thDivision in the VII Corps and they remained at Le Cauroy under theorders of that Corps until the 23rd July when they moved toEperlecques near St Omer and came under the Fifth ArmyBut the division lost Gen Hull It was absolutely necessary that heshould undergo a surgical operation and the matter could not bepostponed any longer so he went back to England He was looked uponas a friend as much as a commander his striking personality hadimpressed itself on all ranks and his tall figure was recognised fromafar and welcomed whenever he visited the line or billets The men sawin him a fearless commander who knew his business We are indebted toMajor Newnham for the following anecdote     After the 1st July show 1916 the 169th Brigade held the     trenches in front of Fouquevillers The trenches though on     top of a hill were dreadful My diary records all CTs     thighdeep in mud Gen Hull doubted our statement so on     Sunday the 9th July when he came to Brigade Headquarters     I showed him the state of things We went up the main CT     and gradually the slime rose first ankle then knee then     thighdeep At length where the CT ran in a hollow I     said Now we get to a really deep bit sir He said              145     Well Im damned if Im going through itIm getting out     And we went over the top though in full view from a large     part of the Boche positions and walked back in the open     tooAnd the General was enthusiastic in praise of his divisionWe were a happy family he says And what pleased me as much astheir fighting qualities was their good temper and cheerfulness underall circumstances and the circumstances were at times appallinglysevere He was himself always cheerful though his pet dog an Irishgreyhound named Roy has been described as a miserable hound Heencouraged his staff to play bridge whenever their work permittedas a means of taking their minds off the war All work and no playwould have made even a GSO1 a dull boy and relaxation was not easyto find He commanded the 4th Battalion Middlesex Regt at Mons andwas given command of the 10th Brigade on the 17th November 1914 Whenhe first entered the army in 1887 he joined the Royal ScotsFusiliers and was transferred to the Middlesex Regt in 1912 We aresorry to say that the miserable hound Roy who had been with theGeneral since January 1916 cut a tendon and had to be destroyed inBelgium although he survived the warGen Hull was not however lost to the division as he returnedlater Meanwhile Gen W Douglas Smith was given commandTroops were being massed for the big offensive at Ypres and the FifthArmy Staff under Sir Hubert Gough had been moved to take command of    146the greater part of the salient Sir Herbert Plumer was still therebut on the southern side and with a reduced army                                         In July 1917 England reached the summit of her military power inFrance There were 52 divisions from the Motherland 4 from Canada 5from Australia 1 from New Zealand One might therefore expect ayear of great results And so it was though not perhaps obviouslyapparentWriting of the year as a whole Sir Douglas Haig says     The general conditions of the struggle this year have been     very different from those contemplated at the conference of     the Allied Commanders held in November 1916 The great     general and simultaneous offensive then agreed on did not     materialise Russia though some of her leaders made a fine     effort at one period not only failed to give the help     expected of her but even failed to prevent the enemy from     transferring some forty divisions from her front in exchange     for tired ones used up in the Western theatre or from     replacing losses in his divisions on this side by drafts of     fresh and welltrained men drawn from divisions in the East     The combined French and British offensive in the spring was     launched before Italy could be ready and the splendid     effort made by Italy at a later period was unfortunately     followed by developments which resulted in a weakening of     the Allied forces in this theatre before the conclusion of     our offensive     In these circumstances the task of the British and French     armies has been a far heavier one throughout the year than     was originally anticipated and the enemys means of meeting        147     our attack have been far greater than either he or we could     have expectedIt was a year of disappointment but was not a year withoutachievement We had failed against the Turk at Gaza but had succeededat Baghdad the French spring offensive had not succeeded and our owncould only be described as a steadying blow at the Germans Kerenskycame on the scene in Russia in May and no doubt did his best butdiscipline had gone and the offensive of Brussiloff and Korniloffthough it succeeded at first was well in hand so far as the CentralPowers were concerned in July The East was the weak spot in ourcalculations with Russia going to ruin and dragging Rumania with herIt was as well that Britain was at the crest of the power waveAfter all battles have a further object than the mere killing of menFor quite a long while after the commencement of the war the Germanstalked boastfully of their will The will to victory was going tocrush the moral of their enemies But although the Russianrevolution caused great rejoicing although the German High Commandclaimed a long list of victories it seemed that German moralwas somehow flagging and their enemys will to victory was asdetermined as everLudendorff admits that in the summer of 1917 the position of theCentral Powers was better than that of the Entente but that therewere other causes for our spiritual decline He says thatFieldMarshal Hindenburg wrote to the Emperor on the 27th June thatour greatest anxiety at this moment however is the decline of thenational spirit It must be revived or we shall lose the war Therewere speeches in the Reichstag containing the despairing cry that        148it was impossible to win the war On the 7th July Hindenburg andLudendorff met members of the Reichstag to discuss our defensiveattitude throughout the first half of 1917 the various failures nearArras in the Wytschte salient and in Galicia where we had not asyet attacked the absence up to date of any decisive result from thesubmarine war and our serious situation as regards food and rawmaterials And finally on the 25th July General Ludendorff wrotethat it is certain that the Independent Social Democrats are carryingon an agitation in the army which is in the highest degree detrimentalto disciplineAnd the allies of Germany were giving her a great deal of troubleOne can only ask what created this frame of mind Even a SocialDemocrat must have the ground prepared before his doctrines cangerminate and flourish it must be fertilised with dissatisfaction andwatered with despair The German and Austrian nations were as one intheir desire for war in August 1914 and so strong that they hadlittle difficulty in winning the Turkish and Bulgarian nations totheir cause Then surely we may answer the question by saying that itwas the guns of the Allied artillery and the rifles of the Alliedinfantry that caused the will to falter even when the positionseemed most favourable to the War Lord and his advisers It was a slowprocess but a sure oneOne must admit disappointment to France and Britain as the leaders ofthe countries allied against the Central Powers but we cannot see thejustice of the German contention that their own position was good       149In considering the events of this war it is not easy to appreciatethe mind of a man who says the military situation was good but thecondition of the country behind the army was bad Country and armysurely hang together The Germans never looked upon war as a clash ofarmies alone but sought by every means in their power by oppressionby slavery by terror to bend the noncombatant population to theirwill It is a logical view This war at least was waged by countryagainst country by nation against nation and as a nation Germany wascracking and her allies with herThis was the state of affairs when the Battles of Ypres 1917 afteran artillery preparation which had been growing in volume for a monthopened with a stupendous crash on the 31st Julyan official dateFrom the very first the Second and Fifth British Armies and the FirstFrench Army on the left met with the fiercest resistance The left ofthe Fifth Army and the First French Army gained the greatestsuccessthe right of the Fifth Army and the Second Army did littlemore than capture the enemy first line of defence Whatever thecondition of the German people the German Army seemed as strong asever And yet it was being nursedThe system with which the Germans started the war was not one based onconsideration for lives Verdun and the Somme had shaken the veryfoundations of that system and if the German Army was still strongand good German Commanders had already expressed anxiety as to thefuture conduct of their troops Loss of lives and loss of moral hadbeen responsible for a new method of defence The front line was to be   150held by few men and many machine guns and retirement before strongenemy fire was advocated The position was to be regained by means ofrapid counterattack Instead of holding a line a zone was heldDefence in depth was the policyThis loosened method of defence lessened the wastage of troops fromartillery fire and in addition the system of pillboxes wasinstituted These small reinforced concrete forts could withstand adirect hit of all but the heaviest shell and were admirably adaptedfor the defence of a place like Flanders where dugouts were almost animpossibility In fact the new German pamphlet The DefensiveBattle was a distinct departure from the old Cannon Fodder pointof view If the Reichstag was openly saying that the war could not bewon the High Command of the Army was wondering if it would stand manymore blowsMen who fought at Ypres will say that they noticed no loss ofmoral in the enemy and with this we agree we only wish to insistthat there were indications which had not escaped the eyes of theGerman Command As to the hard heartbreaking fighting of the Battlesof Ypres 1917 it is only just to the gallant French and Britishtroops to point out once more the many advantages that lay with theirenemiesFor over two years the Germans had held their semicircle round theeast of Ypres The positions they occupied though only the summits ofinsignificantlooking rises not even worthy of the name of hillsoverlooked the whole of the French and British assembly area Not amove escaped their observers who knew every inch of the ground What    151a place to prepare for an attackBooks of reference will give the 31st July as the opening date of the1917 Battles of Ypres It is false The 31st is the date of theassaultthe battles started with the first indications of the Britishintention to attack Every new trench every trace of new diggingevery new track taped out every building every hamlet every woodwas bombarded by the enemy with guns and aeroplanes which becameextremely active at this period As the concentration of troopsincreased all attempts at concealment were abandoned and camps werepitched in the open The whole area was a target and was welldescribed by a gunner who remarked Every time a coconutObservation on the other hand was denied to usAll this bad in itself the troops were able to face But the enemyhad another advantage being on the defensive and that was thecondition of the ground over which the attackers had to advanceThere is no place on the whole of the Western Front which can becompared to this stretch of Flanders If an infantryman or anartilleryman attempted to give an adequate account of the conditionsand the horrors which they occasioned he would not be believed Wewill therefore give the words of the Higher Command with the onecriticism that they are not strong enough Sir Douglas Haig wrote     The weather had been threatening throughout the day 31st     July and had rendered the work of the aeroplanes very     difficult from the commencement of the battle During the           152     afternoon while the fighting was still in progress rain     fell and fell steadily all night Thereafter for four days     the rain continued without cessation and for several days     after the weather remained stormy and unsettled The     lowlying clayey soil torn by shells and sodden with rain     turned into a succession of vast muddy pools The valleys of     the choked and overflowing streams were speedily transformed     into long stretches of bog impassable except by a few     welldefined tracks which became marks for the enemys     artillery To leave these tracks was to risk death by     drowning and in the course of the subsequent fighting on     several occasions both men and pack animals were lost in     this way As had been the case in the Arras battle this     unavoidable delay in the development of our offensive was of     the greatest service to the enemy Valuable time was lost     the troops opposed to us were able to recover from the     disorganisation produced by our first attack and the enemy     was given the opportunity to bring up reinforcementsThe enemy view of the conditions is given by Ludendorff     Enormous masses of ammunition such as the human mind had     never imagined before the war was hurled upon the bodies of     men who passed a miserable existence scattered about in     mudfilled shellholes The horror of the shellhole area of     Verdun was surpassed It was no longer life at all It was     mere unspeakable suffering And through this world of mud     the attackers dragged themselves slowly but steadily and     in dense masses Caught in the advance zone by our hail of     fire they often collapsed and the lonely man in the     shellhole breathed again Then the mass came on again     Rifle and machine gun jammed with the mud Man fought     against man and only too often the mass was successful         153     And yet it must be admitted that certain units no longer     triumphed over the demoralising effects of the defensive     battle as they had done formerly  [Illustration INVERNESS COPSE AND GLENCORSE WOOD AUGUST 1917]Very naturally Ludendorff claims that statues in bronze should beerected to the German soldier for the suffering he experienced atYpres But his own picture of the attackers seems somehow to be worsethan that of the defenders if there are degrees of sufferingOn the 31st July the assault of the Fifth Army met with completesuccess on the left where the crossing of the Steenbeke was securedBut on the right the II Corps was only partially successful Afteroverrunning the first system of defence about Hooge and SanctuaryWood divisions were met with tremendous opposition and eventuallychecked at Inverness Copse and Glencorse WoodOn the 4th of August the 56th Division started to move fromEperlecques and on the 6th Divisional Headquarters were atReninghelst under the II Corps MajorGen F A Dudgeon assumedcommand of the division on the 10th and on the 12th the division tookover the line from Surbiton Villas to Westhoek facing Glencorse Woodand Nonne Bosschen But before this date the Divisional Artillery wasin action                                         We cannot do better than quote from BrigGen Elkingtons mostinteresting diary     On the 2nd and 3rd of August the 56th Divisional Artillery     relieved the 8th Divisional Artillery in the line taking over     their gun positions near Hooge The artillery then experienced     what I think was their worst time during the war All the           154     battery positions were shelled day and night more in the nature     of harassing fire with occasional counterbattery shoots The     ground was so wet that digging was impossible and the men lived     in holes in the ground covered with corrugated iron The early     dawn was the only time it was safe to get supplies and ammunition     if casualties were to be avoided and with all precautions most     batteries lost 100 per cent of their gun line strength in killed     and wounded The artillery supported operations on the 10th     12th 16th and 25th August and answered SOS calls on most     days also a very heavy day on the 24th of August when the enemy     counterattacked in force On the 16th and 17th the whole of the     guns of D280 were put out of action enemy shell fire and     exploding ammunition practically blew them to pieces and except     for the actual tubes of the three howitzers nothing was found     worth salving On the 31st August the artillery came out of the     line and entrained south on the 1st September to rejoin the 56th     Division and all ranks hoped they had seen the last of the Ypres     salientWe can only add to this that the selection of gun positions was amatter of finding a place where the guns would not disappear in themud and which was not already occupied by another batteryThe battle of the 16th is the one which concerns us On that day theFifth Army attacked from the northwest corner of Inverness Copse tothe junction with the First French Army south of St Janshoek [theBattle of Langemarck 1917] The French always attacked on the leftThe II Corps on the right attacked with the 56th and 8th DivisionsThe objective was the same as that of the 31st July a line drawn toinclude some 500 yards in depth of Polygon Wood and so on to the        155north But there is not much point in going over orders BrigGenFreeth reports with some bitterness it seems to us Orders werereceived and issued so hurriedly that it was impossible for brigadeand battalion staffs to keep pace with them There was not time forthe scheme of operations to be thoroughly explained to regimentalofficers much less to the men Indeed the mass of documents isappalling and taken together with the facts point to confusion of amost distressing natureIt must be understood that Gen Dudgeon was in no better case thanBrigGen Freeth On the 11th August the division had been ordered totake over the line from the 18th Division and portions of the 25thDivision On that same day the General attended a conference at CorpsHeadquarters and learnt that the 53rd Brigade of the 18th Divisionwould remain in the line and come under his orders for the battle Hewas called upon to attack on a front of 1500 yards on a depth of1700 yards with a defensive flank of 1700 yards extending from thesoutheastern corner of Stirling Castle to Black Watch Corner On the12th the 169th Brigade was ordered to undertake a small operation withthe object of improving the line about Glencorse Wood an undertakingwhich the 18th Division had failed to carry out But the 169th Brigademet with strong opposition and also failed On the 14th the enemyattacked the 167th Brigade on the left of the line and drove in someposts they were reestablished Later on that day at a conferencethe BrigadierGeneral commanding the 53rd Brigade represented that hisbrigade was not in a state to carry out the attack ordered owing toheavy casualties The General then placed the 4th London Regt under     156the orders of the 53rd Brigade and the trouble commencedtheCommanding Officer was wounded on his way to interview the BrigadierThe second in command had then to go and reconnoitre on the followingday which left his battalion less than twentyfour hours in which tomake the necessary reconnaissance and preparation to get intopositionOn the 15th instant as the result of a conference with the CorpsCommander and the GOC 8th Division the starting line was alteredOwing to the date fixed for the attack an interbattalion relief wasnecessary on the night 1415th In fact the ground was so bad thatthere were reliefs or remains of reliefs going on every night Itwas not possible to undertake any patrolling to gain a knowledge ofthe ground and in daylight the shelling was so constant and accuratethat study of the country was most difficultThe General writes     The darkness of the night the boggy state of the ground     heavy shelling of all approaches and the fact that the     division was strange to the ground and had little     opportunity for reconnaissance and preparation presented     great difficulties in carrying out the assembly  but the     difficulties were surmounted and the troops assembled in     time though there is no doubt that the state of the ground     caused much fatigueSo by 4 am the 53rd Brigade with the 7th Bedford 6th Berkshireand 4th London Regts in line was on the right In the centre was the169th Brigade with the 5th and 2nd London Regts in line On the leftthe 167th Brigade with the 8th Middlesex and 1st London Regts in        157lineAt 445 am on the 16th August the barrage opened and the assaultingtroops clambered out of their mud holes Red and green lights werefired from the enemy rear lines but his barrage did not answer tothese signals for some minutes But the new enemy system of defence indepth and by means of concrete forts was to be met for the first timeby the 56th Division The barrage was good and if anything creptforward too slowly but the concrete fort was immune from damage byshells from the lighter batteries and the German machinegunner wasable to fire through our barrageThe 7th Bedford Regt was stopped at once by one of these forts on thenorthwest of Inverness Copse The failure to capture this pointreacted on the 4th London Regt which suffered very heavy loss andwas brought to a standstill to the north of the western side of thewood they managed to work their way forward and form a defensiveflank along the southern edge of Glencorse Wood                                         The 169th Brigade progressed well at first The London Rifle Brigadeand the 2nd London Regt disposed of isolated parties with machineguns dotted about in shell holes on their front but soon bumped intoa marsh The 2nd London Regt edged to the right pushing the LondonRifle Brigade still farther away And the same obstruction being metby the 167th Brigade the 8th Middlesex edged to the left to avoidthe marsh pushing the 1st London Regt as they did so There was thena big gap between the two Brigades very soon after the startThe enemy resistance was found by the 169th Brigade beyond the marsh     158in the centre of Glencorse Wood Here along a sunken road was a lineof concrete forts or pillboxes Hard fighting and heavy casualtiesfollowed The artillery was no longer helpful but Glencorse Wood wasfinally cleared The leading waves of the two battalions then went onand reached Polygon Wood but what happened to them is not known Thesecond waves were checked at Polygon Wood by heavy fire from the frontand the flanks and before they could steady themselves were thrownback by a counterattack which was only stopped by the QueenVictorias Rifles who were coming up in support Later in the day asecond and heavier counterattack from the east and south drove thewhole of the brigade back to the original front line  [Illustration 5 THE BATTLE OF LANGEMARCK 1917]The 167th Brigade on the left made better progress than any of theothersfor a time The gap between the 169th and 167th Brigades wasnever filled so that when the 8th Middlesex came across a second lakeof mud four feet deep about the north end of Nonne Bosschen theirright flank was exposed And on the left the 1st London Regt had beenheavily shelled before the start so that when they did advance therear waves pressed on the leading wave until all became mixed and noone carried out the special task of clearing the ground as it was wonthe position was that although the main weight of the attack wascarried forward to the left of the 8th Middlesex many enemy sniperswere behind both battalions of the 167th Brigade There is also onthis flank the mystery of a company that disappeared Although itseems pretty clear that the waves bunched up together they must also    159have split the third wave composed of the larger part of a companywas reported by its company commander in writing sent by runner tobe in a position north of Polygon Wood and no doubt he got there butneither he nor his men were heard of again A thin wave of the 8thDivision reached this same line but were immediately driven back by amassed and carefully timed counterattackBut the attack of the 167th Brigade was completely held up At 7 amthe 8th Middlesex saw the troops of the 169th Brigade falling backthrough Glencorse Wood they then took up a position to their reartheir southern flank being refused so as to gain touch with the 169thBrigade The situation remained unaltered through the afternoonAbout 3 pm the enemy was reported to be massing opposite the 25thBrigade on the left of the 56th Division and shortly after to beattacking all along the 167th Brigade front In view of the barrier ofmud it is probable that he was only trying to reoccupy the ground fromwhich he had retired But our artillery had direct observation andheavy fire was opened on him and his troops dispersedAbout 5 pm the 167th Brigade again retired to a more favourableposition which gave them a net gain of 400 yards beyond theiroriginal line They were then in touch with the 25th Brigade 8thDivisionAll attacking battalions were withdrawn and the line was held by theQueen Victorias Rifles the Queens Westminster Rifles and the 7thMiddlesex Regt The division was relieved the following night by the14th Division and moved to Steenvoorde E Ouderdom Wippenhoek thebrigades being quartered in that numerical orderThe total casualties from the 13th to the 17th August were 111           160officers and 2794 other ranks The loss in senior officers wasparticularly heavy LieutCol H Campbell Major V A Flower MajorJ E L Higgins and Major M R Harris all of the 13th London RegtKensingtons LieutCol R R Husey of the 5th London RegtLieutCol J P Kellett of the 2nd London Regt LieutCol P LIngpen of the 8th Middlesex and LieutCol F W D Bendall of the7th Middlesex Regt were all woundedMaybe the confusion was inevitable but it makes a sorry story inwhich the great gallantry of the London Territorials stands forth likesomething clean and honest in the midst of slime and mud Gen Dudgeongives us some of the causes of the failure to reach the desiredobjective     Insufficient time for preparation and explanation of the     scheme of attack to those taking part and insufficient time     to study the terrain     The portion of the 25th Division relieved by the 167th     Brigade had only been in the line twentyfour hours     previously and could not assist much     Lack of previous preparation No dumps of any kind were     taken over in the area and there was insufficient time to     form all those that were necessary     Indifferent communications Tracks east of Chteau Wood were     nonexistent and the tapes were soon obliterated by the     mud     Difficulty of maintaining signal communication     Fatigue of troops previous to the attack owing to the bad     weather     The condition of the ground over which the attack took     place The bog at the source of the Hanebeck made a gap     between the 169th and 167th Brigades which laid their left         161     and right flanks respectively open to counterattack It     also caused great fatigue to the troops     The nature of the hostile defences and new system of defence     in depth The enemys counterattacks were so timed as to     strike the leading waves about the same time as they reached     their objectives when they were more or less disorganised     and had been unable to consolidate the ground gained     The concentration of hostile guns opposite the front The     heavy shelling prevented the moving up of reinforcements     machine guns and replenishment of ammunitionIt seems very certain that the British Staff was somewhat rattled bythe German tactics in defence Questionslong lists of themweresent out and reports asked for The pillbox it was agreeddisorganised our assaulting waves although it did not stop them Butthere is a limit to the possible advance of troops in a rush and thishad been calculated by the enemy who placed his main forces so as tocounterattack the exhausted leading waves of attackers before theyhad time to consolidate or even mop up the ground behind them Howwas this to be overcomeAll officers of the 56th Division seemed to agree on this questionThe answer was Do not try to penetrate too deeply Five hundredyards was a distance which troops could cover without exhaustion andthey would then be at such a distance from any troops assembled forcounterattack as would give them time to consolidate bring upmachine guns and be ready for the counterattack Something of thesort was eventually done so the experience of the 56th Division wasof some serviceThe attack was not renewed on this sector of the front until the 20th    162September when the Second Army Sir Herbert Plumers command wasextended to his left captured Glencorse and the half of Polygon WoodThe fighting in Flanders was carried on until November The Frenchlaunched a big attack at Verdun on the 20th August which met withnotable success Ludendorff confesses to a feeling of despairConcrete had failed him and as to his troops At some points they nolonger displayed the firmness which I in common with the localcommanders had hoped for By limiting the depth of penetration andbreaking up the German counterattacks with artillery fire the Britishtroops were slowly eating their way through the defences in Flandersin spite of having to wade through mud Many were the consultations atGerman Headquarters Our defensive tactics had to be developedfurther somehow or other The wastage of troops had exceeded allexpectations Seven divisions were sent to Italy A countering blowwas the best defenceSir Douglas Haig hoped that the phenomenal wet summer would befollowed by a normal autumn and continued his attacks throughOctober But the wet still continued and important engagements withlarge numbers of troops and tremendous expenditure of ammunition onlyresulted in a nibble at the enemy territoryThe GermanAustrian attack on Italy started on the 24th October andresulted in the Italian Armies being driven back almost to theoutskirts of Venice This misfortune had the immediate effect ofreducing the British Army on the Western Front by several divisions     163which were sent under the command of Sir Herbert Plumer and later ofLord Cavan to help our Italian Allies it also determined Sir DouglasHaig to continue his operations in Flanders The fierce battle forPasschendaele in which the proud divisions from Canada added to theirimmortal fame was fought and operations in Flanders reached theirfinal stages about the middle of NovemberFor the effort expended the gain in territory was small the numberof prisoners was 24065 the number of guns captured 74 wasinsignificant But the balancing of results is a very delicate affairDuring the three and a half months of the offensive the enemy hademployed 78 divisions 18 of them had been engaged a second or thirdtime after having rested and refitted Deductions from such factshowever are a weak basis for argument Sir Douglas Haig wrote It iscertain that the enemys losses considerably exceeded ours butapart from considerations of expediency it is not clear how hearrived at this startling conclusionTo compare the number of prisoners we captured with the number ofbayonets which the Germans could transfer from the Russian front isabsurd What then have we left to show as a result for this costlyenterprise Only damage to that highly important but very elusivething which we call enemy moral The enemy charges usperhaps with some truth with being clumsy soldiers with noimagination but he speaks with respect of the determination of theBritish infantry in a manner which suggests a growing conviction thatthey could never be defeated                                         An interesting figure was compiled by the II Corps giving the amount     164of ammunition fired by the artillery of that corps from the 23rd Juneto 31st August2766824 rounds with a total weight of 85396 tonsdelivered by 230 trains of 37

moreprominent part in the life of the soldier and we find the divisionalcanteen being enlargeda greengrocery eggs and butter departmentbeing added also a wholesale beer department And of course therewas trainingAt the commencement of the war the British infantry were the greatestriflemen in the world Then came a period when everyone was mad onthrowing bombs and the rifle was neglected At the end of the war one   166sighed in vain for a half even a quarter of the efficiency of theprewar riflemanTraining in 1917 was based on four weapons and the platoon Theplatoon we were told was the smallest unit comprising all theweapons with which the infantry was armed Exclusive of Headquarterstwentyeight other ranks was the minimum strength and when theplatoon was below that strength the necessary numbers would beobtained by the temporary amalgamation of companies platoons orsections We draw attention to these words because the order wasafterwards reversedThe platoon was comprised of a rifle section a Lewisgun section abomber section and a riflegrenade section The principles governingtraining were based on these various weapons The rifle and bayonetwere for assault for repelling attack or for obtaining superiorityof fire and the training of this section was considered of muchimportance Each man should be a marksman first class with bayonetand bomb and a scout in addition to being either a Lewisgunner orrifle grenadier Bayonet fighting was recommended to all sections asit produced lust for bloodThe bomb was called the second weapon of all NCOs and men and wasto be used for dislodging the enemy from behind cover or killing himbelow ground The section should study bombing attacks and the dutiesof moppersup These last individuals should work in pairs Theywere to drop into their objectives and work laterally outwards Theykilled the enemy met with in the trenches and they also guarded theentrances to dugouts and side trenches They were not to penetratedown dugouts until the platoon they were working for arrived           167The rifle grenade was described as the howitzer of the infantry andwas used to dislodge the enemy from behind cover and to drive himbelow ground The section was trained to a riflegrenade barrageThe Lewis gun was the weapon of opportunity Its mobility and thesmall target it presented made it peculiarly suitable for workinground an enemys flankIn each section sufficient ammunition was carried for immediaterequirements Every man except bombers signallers scouts runnersand Lewis gunners who carried 50 rounds carried at least 120 roundsof rifle ammunition and 2 bombs The Lewisgun section carried 30drums The bombers with the exception of throwers who carried 5carried at least 10 bombs eachThe men of the riflegrenade section each carried at least sixgrenades With this organisation training was carried out intrenchtotrench warfare and the enveloping of strong pointsIn 1917 the strength of a platoon was not definitely laid down by theHigher Command It was suggested that a suitable number for eachsection was nine1 noncommissioned officer and 8 men But there wasan order to leave 10 officers and 50 other ranks out of line forreconstruction They would not be available as reinforcements butwere generally specialists and good instructors on whom thebattalion could be rebuilt if casualties were heavy Most unitscarried out the suggestion of 9 to a section and any extra menexclusive of the 50 for reconstruction were used as reinforcementsduring the battleOn arrival in the Third Army area now under the command of General      168Byng General Allenby having been given command in Egypt thestrength of the 56th Division was very lowThe four battalions of the 167th Brigade totalled altogether 63officers and 1754 other ranks the Machine Gun Company 7 officersand 150 other ranks the Trench Mortar Battery 5 officers and 50other ranksThe four battalions of the 168th Brigade totalled 94 officers and2802 other ranks the Machine Gun Company 7 officers and 160 otherranks the Trench Mortar Battery 5 officers and 90 other ranksThe four battalions of the 169th Brigade totalled 61 officers and1921 other ranks the Machine Gun Company 10 officers and 145 otherranks the Trench Mortar Battery 2 officers and 75 other ranksIt was therefore probable that when the period of rest was over thedivision would go into a quiet bit of the lineAll doubts as to the ultimate destination of the division were laid atrest on the 4th September when the 168th Brigade relieved the 9thBrigade 3rd Division in the Lagnicourt section The 169th Brigaderelieved the 8th Brigade in the Louverval section on the 5th and the167th Brigade relieved the 76th Brigade in the Morchies section on the6th The situation was quiet and the weather fine and hotPatrolling of an active nature commenced at once and on the 10thSeptember the 167th Brigade secured a man of the 31st Reserve InfantryRegt and on the same night the 168th Brigade secured two of the 86thReserve Infantry Regt Various enemy posts were visited from time totime and occasionally entered but the gem of these small enterprises   169was that of the Queens Westminster Rifles On the 29th September2Lieut W H Ormiston with thirty men lay in wait in the middle ofNo Mans Land and successfully ambushed a patrol of fifteen GermansEleven were killed and two brought in unfortunately the remainingtwo proved swift of foot and got away It was not done without afight Six of the Queens Westminsters were wounded Both Corps andArmy Commanders sent their congratulations to this wellknown andgallant regiment with the added message that the identification wasof great importance The prisoners were of the 414th Infantry RegtDuring this month six hundred gas projectors were dug into the 56thDivisional FrontDuring the month of October raids were attempted by the LondonScottish and the Kensingtons but the enemy were found alert and theparties failed to enter the German line The Kensingtons howeverwere successful in rescuing a British pilot whose machine was broughtdown in No Mans Land but they had to fight for himThe only incident of importance in the month of October was a visit often days of MajorGen Bloxom USA with his chief of staff withthe object of gaining experienceThe strength of the division remained about the sameOn the 2nd November a document headed IV Corps No HRS 1748 wasreceived into which we must enter at some lengthThe Third Army stretched from the little stream of lOmignon whichruns into the St Quentin Canal a few miles above that town toGavrelle north of the Scarpe It was composed of the VII III IV      170VI and XVII Corps from right to left and later the V Corps TheIII Corps had its right on 22 Ravine between VillersGuislain andGonnelieu and its left to the east of Trescault Then came the IVCorps with its left north of Lagnicourt on a little stream calledthe Hirondelle These two corps were facing the Hindenburg Line andhad in their immediate rear the battlefields of the Somme and thecountry which the Germans had laid to waste in their retreat in theearly springAt the time when our pursuing troops were brought to a standstill infront of this celebrated line preparations were at once commenced forattack Several actions had been fought on this sector before itsettled down to a quiet sector assembly trenches existed andadequate shelter for brigade and battalion headquarters had beenconstructed It was now chosen as a sector to be attackedAt this time our Italian Allies were in serious difficulties andseven German divisions were engaged in this theatre And although themovement of whole divisions had started from Russia without exchangefrom the Western Front a mass of enemy troops were still pinned downin Flanders It seemed as though a sudden surprise attack mightbenefit the Italian Armies and also improve the position on theWestern Front But there was the obvious difficulty of a lack oftroops at Sir Douglas Haigs disposal the Flanders adventure had beena most costly one for us for practically the whole of the BritishArmy had passed through the salient inferno Ypres Finally it wasdecided that sufficient troops could be mustered to justify theattack and as the French not only promised to engage the enemys        171attention elsewhere but actually set aside a large force of cavalryand infantry to help in the attack they started to move on the 20thNovember the order was givenThe scheme as set forth in this document was for the infantry tobreak through the German defensive system with the aid of Tanks on afront from Gonnelieu to Hermies seize the crossings of the Canal delEscaut at Masnires and Marcoing cut the last of the enemysdefences on the BeaurevoirMasnires line and pass the cavalrythrough the break thus madeThe cavalry were then to capture Cambrai and Bourlon Wood cut allrailway communications into Cambrai and to occupy the crossings ofthe Sense between Paillencourt and Palleul to the north of CambraiThey would come up from Gouzeaucourt and MetzenCoutureIf this part of the plan was accomplished the whole of the Third Armywould participate in further operations to complete the surrounding ofall the enemy forces in the Quant salient Presumably our Allieswould have been called upon as wellThe III Corps composed of the 20th 6th 12th 29th Divisions and2nd and 3rd Brigades Tank Corps less three companies would securethe canal crossings at Marcoing and Masnires and form a flank fromGonnelieu through Bois Lateau Crevecur to a spot called la BelleEtoile a few miles southeast of CambraiThe IV Corps composed of the 51st 62nd 36th 56th Divisions and1st Brigade Tank Corps would attack with two divisions on the leftof the III Corps and the right of the Canal du Nord towards            172Flesquires and GraincourtThe success of the whole plan depended on the capture of Masnires andMarcoing at which point the cavalry would be passed through thebreak and as speed was the essence of the operation in order toobtain liberty of movement before the enemy could organise eithercounterattack or a fresh line of defence by bringing up fresh troopsthe leading cavalry divisions would have to pass through on theafternoon or evening of zero dayMeanwhile the IV Corps would be pushing forward on the left with thefirst object of establishing a line from Noyelles along the Canal delEscaut through Fontaines and relieve the cavalry on Bourlon orfight for that position and join with the original front line in theLouverval sectorSurprise was essential so there would be no preliminary bombardmentand these instructions insisted that the greatest care should be takennot to divulge the presence of increased artillery to the enemyRegistration and calibration was to be carried out by order of theGeneral Officer Commanding the Third Army ArtilleryOne of the first tasks was to erect camouflage over all positionswhich would be occupied by the artillery Then weatherproof cover forammunition would be constructed But little more than this could bedone in the time at the disposal of the Army In any case theaccumulation of ammunition would have to be spread over as long aperiod as possible so as to minimise the increase of activity on therailwaysThe action of the artillery would consist mainly in the formation ofsmoke screens and barrages on the front and flanks of the attack to    173cover the advance of the Tanks and the neutralisation of hostilebatteries the bombardment of positions of assembly rest billetstelephone routes and known centres of communication and command Butthe very nature of the operation precluded the careful registration ofall batteriesAll the elaborate preparations of a trenchtotrench attack would bereduced to a minimum and in many items must be done away with Coverfrom weather would have to be provided for the full number of troopswhen concentrated but no extensive scheme of hutting or new campscould be undertaken In thick woods tents suitably camouflaged couldbe erected and in thin woods wire netting must be stretchedhorizontally amongst the trees about ten feet from the ground andhave twigs scattered on the top of it thus making a sort of roofunder which bivouacs could be pitchedAs to concentration the idea was to complete the move of theartillery before the infantry was brought into the area to have theextra infantry in the area as short a time as possible and to bringup the Tanks at the very last momentFinally No 15 Squadron RFC was ordered to note particularlywhether any of the work being carried out was noticeable from the airThe rle of the 56th Division in all this was to make a demonstrationon Z day and attract the attention of the enemy and later on takepart in the operation of rolling up the Hindenburg Line When BourlonWood had been captured the IV Corps would secure a lineRumancourtBuissyInchy which would cut off the German divisions inthe Quant salient and threaten with immediate capture their gunpositions In this move two brigades of the 36th Division would          174take part on the east bank of the canal and one brigade on the west ofthe canal starting from the Spoil Heap near Hermies and moving in thedirection of Muvres and InchyThe 169th Brigade which would be on the right of the 56th Divisionalfront would be responsible for joining hands with the 109th Brigade36th Division and with them attack in the direction of Tadpole CopseIn this attack Tanks were to be employed but the number was nevergivenNothing amuses troops more than to deceive the enemyand we sayamuse advisedly for though it is in the midst of a battle withdeath and destruction going on all round them men will be as keen aschildren in carrying out the scheme of makebelieve and if itsucceeds will roar with laughter Such a scheme was on foot for the56th DivisionFor the purpose of making the demonstration on the divisional front asrealistic as possible a number of dummy Tanks were to be made by theCRE while brigades would amuse themselves by making dummy figuresof men to act as supporting infantry The Tanks were to be put out inNo Mans Land during the night and would be half hidden by the smokebarrage in the morning when the attack started the figures would bepushed above the trenches as though infantry were just emerging Amotorbicycle in the frontline trench was to imitate the noise of aTankAs might well be expected excitement ran high in the division Theconstruction of dummy figures and dummy Tanks was taken in hand atonce and by the 19th November a dozen fullsized Tanks were readytogether with some two hundred and fifty figures to each brigade         175frontOn the 6th November wirecutting was commenced by trench mortars inthe neighbourhood of Quant250 rounds a day being firedthe Germanswould probably think a raid was contemplated which would account forany suspicious movementsThe time was short and as preliminary preparation was to be cut downto a minimum fatigues were not very arduous There was a certainamount of work done on the roads near the front line but the greatestcare had to be exercised not to make improvements of an apparentnature In the back areas however the strain was becomingintolerable There were troops in every hole and corner Tents werecrammed full huts ruins any place where men could find a littleshelter was used And the weather was cold and regulations aboutlights and fires were very stringentIn the front line every precaution against accidents was taken Theattacking divisions occupied their positions in line but the oldtroops remained in the outpost line in case the enemy should secureidentification also patrols were ordered to avoid any possibility ofcaptureOn the 14th November the Corps ordered the 56th Division to hold theline with two brigades instead of three so as to have a concentratedforce ready to act in case of necessity So on the night of the 18ththe 167th Brigade extended its left and took over the frontage of the168th Brigade which concentrated in Fremicourt and Beugny to theeast of BapaumeOn the night of the 19th the dummy Tanks were put in position about300 yards from the front line At 2 am on the 20th gas drums were      176projected into the German lines where the wirecutting had taken placeQuant and at 620 am the whole of the artillery on the ThirdArmy front opened on the enemy lines with one stupendous crashIn the 56th Division front line all was activity The parties with thedummy figures moved them up and down in as lifelike a manner as theycould and other parties hurled smoke grenades so that the enemy mightnot see too clearlyThe makebelieve attack was a great success The Germans openedfrantic and furious fire with machineguns and artillery and thedummy Tanks were shelled until middayBy 915 am the 36th Division 109th Brigade had advanced along thewest bank of the canal from the Spoil Heap to the BapaumeCambrairoad where the 169th Brigade joined up with it on the old Germanoutpost lineMeanwhile great events had been taking place on the right The IIICorps on which so much depended advanced through the Hindenburg Linein grand style and thanks to the rapid action of the 29th DivisionGeneral de Lisle which was to wait until news arrived of thecapture of the Hindenburg Support Line before advancing but attackedinstead on observer reports seized Marcoing and Masnires The firstbit of bad luck happened at Masnires where the enemy had onlypartially destroyed the iron bridge over the Escault Canal It mighthave been sufficiently strong for cavalry to cross over or it mighthave been repaired to enable them to do so but a Tank attempted tocross first and broke through it altogether This unfortunate accidentdid not stop a squadron of Canadian cavalry who with the dash usually  177associated with that arm rode over a flimsy bridge across a lock onthe Marcoing side of the town and attacked the enemy on Rumilly RidgeIt was probably troopers from this very gallant squadron who reachedthe outskirts of CambraiLieutCol Johnston took the 2nd Hampshires across in a similar wayand secured the crossing But in Marcoing other troops of the 29thDivision secured the bridge intactThe III Corps had therefore done its job but the IV Corps was not sofortunate Havrincourt Wood had been of great service to the IV Corpsin the assembly The 51st and 62nd Divisions with a fringe of the36th Division in front of them until the last moment had completedtheir concentration without a hitch On the nights of the 16th 17thand 18th all the Tanks were moved into Havrincourt Wood and exceptthat a battery of 6inch howitzers got into difficulties farthernorth and that a lorry ran into a train carrying Tanks the wholeconcentration was carried out as desired But although we do notbelieve it made much difference the enemy were aware of the attackUnfortunately some men were captured in a raid on the 36th Divisionalfront and from the statements of prisoners they evidently divulgedthe fact that an attack was contemplated The time and the extent ofit however seems to have been a complete surprise to the GermansAt zero hour the Tanks advanced followed by the 51st and 62ndDivisions There was in this sector some of the most formidable wireon the whole of the western front but the Tanks crushed wide lanesthrough it and the troops advanced steadily There was some obstinate    178fighting in Havrincourt village and park where parties of the enemyheld out until the afternoon but otherwise the Hindenburg front linewas captured by 8 oclock A pause of two hours was allowed here toenable troops and Tanks to reorganise for the attack on the HindenburgSupportOnce more the attack moved forward The 62nd Division on the left metwith little opposition and that portion of the support line allottedto them was in their hands between 10 and 11 oclock But the 51stDivision on the right met with resistance at the village ofFlesquires The infantry were prevented from advancing by machineguns and uncut wire and the Tanks which came up on the ridge wereat once put out of action by field guns which had been pulled out oftheir pits on to the slopes to the north of the village Six Tankswere to be seen here in a line smashed to bits by a very gallantGerman Battery Commander who it was said served and fired the gunshimself when his men had boltedThe 51st Division could make no progress but on their left the 62ndmoved forward to Graincourt and the 36th still farther on the lefthad moved along the canal to the Cambrai road And on the right troopsof the III Corps were well on towards Cantaign The 51st Division madea second attempt with Tanks and again failedWhat follows is one of the mysteries of the Cambrai battle A patrolof King Edwards Horse operating with the 62nd Division rode intoFlesquires soon after midday from the direction of Graincourt Theyreported only a few of the enemy there and do not appear to havesuffered any casualties themselves But the 1st Cavalry Divisionwhich had been concentrated in the neighbourhood of Equancourt had      179been ordered at 825 am to move forward with their head on Metzready to advance This they did About 11 oclock they were ordered topush forward through the Hindenburg Support Line but found thatFlesquires was still in the hands of the enemy and they were unableto pass About 230 pm they were ordered to pass at least tworegiments by Ribecourt and Premy Chapel and work round Flesquiresfrom the northeast and assist the 51st Division in their attack fromthe south But they found they were unable to carry out thiscooperation on account of the delay which had occurred due to theirfirst effort and also that Nine Wood was not clear of the enemy At 4pm the Third Army ordered the cavalry to push forward in fullstrength through Marcoing and carry out the original plan of abreakthrough at that point but darkness had come on and the orderwas modified one brigade being ordered to occupy Cantaign and cut offthe enemy retreating from Flesquires Cantaign however was found tobe too strongly held for the cavalry to capture it and therefore theleading brigade remained at Noyelles for the night It would seem thatthe opportunity was missedAs dusk fell the 62nd and 36th Divisions were well forward towardsthe Bourlon Ridge the former just short of Anneaux and then forminga long flank back east of Graincourt and to the west of Flesquireswhere they connected with the 51st Division Farther to the right ofthe IV Corps the III Corps had also pushed well forward and made asimilar flank facing west the ground between the two points ofgreatest advance about Orival Wood being occupied by the enemysartillery Line CImmediately after the capture of the Hindenburg system the               180redistribution of the artillery and machine guns began The machineguns which had been massed under corps control reverted to theirdivisions Four brigades of Field Artillery one 60pounder batteryand one horsed 6inch Howitzer battery were placed under the ordersof each of the 36th 62nd and 51st Divisions But a fortunatecircumstance arose it was found difficult to get the heavy artilleryacross No Mans Land into the Flesquires salient and the congestionthere was such that the supply of ammunition would have beenuncertain so it was decided to move the bulk of the artillery to theleft close to the old front line round about Demicourt Hermies andMorchies In this position they assisted very materially in breakingup the great German attack on the 30th NovemberDuring this first day the Queen Victorias Rifles were on the right ofthe 169th Brigade and worked along the German outpost line in touchwith the 109th Brigade who were clearing the Hindenburg Line as faras the Cambrai road The 2nd London Regt was on the left of the QueenVictorias RiflesIt had been calculated that no large hostile reinforcements would belikely to reach the scene of action for fortyeight hours after thecommencement of the attack and Sir Douglas Haig had informed GeneralByng that the advance would be stopped after that time unless theresults then gained and the general situation justified itscontinuance Although as we have said the movements of the CanadianCavalry and King Edwards Horse would seem to suggest that theopportunity of passing other cavalry through had been missed thereremained one day when given success they could still be employed      181The 51st and 62nd Divisions were therefore ordered to capture theBourlon position when the 1st Cavalry Division would follow up theattack and seize the passages of the Canal du Nord between Palleul andSainslesMarquion and the 36th Division was to continue the advanceon the west of the canal and hold the two brigades on the easternbank ready to push through and seize the canal betweenSainslesMarquion and Muvres as soon as Bourlon was taken The 56thDivision would be drawn farther into the operations on the left in thedirection of Tadpole CopseWhen the day broke Flesquires was found by the 51st Division to beunoccupied by the enemy they therefore pushed on to theMarcoingGraincourt road capturing a number of guns in the valleywhich the enemy had not been able to remove in the night The 1stCavalry Division then advanced and took Cantaing after some stifffighting in which some of the 51st Division took part On the left the62nd Division captured Anneaux and Anneaux Chapel after heavyfighting and made more progress north of the Cambrai road where theyestablished themselves on the ridge west of Bourlon Wood and alsogained a further stretch of the Hindenburg Support Line On the leftof the 62nd the 36th Division advanced along the west bank of thecanal meeting increased opposition and for a time held the south ofthe village of Muvres On their left again the Queen VictoriasRifles worked along the outpost line and captured a machine gun withits crew of seven Resistance however was stiffening The dividingline between the 109th and the 169th Brigades was the grid line to thewest of Muvres and any farther advance to the north would bring the    18256th Division in contact with the Hindenburg Line itselfMeanwhile in the centre of the battlefield progress was not what hadbeen hoped it would be The 51st Division were to work round BourlonWood from the east and join hands with the 62nd Division but theymet with such opposition as delayed their advance and they did notcapture Fontaine until late in the afternoon The capture of Bourlonwas not achieved At nightfall the 51st Division was holding a linenorth of Cantaing forward to Fontaine making a dangerous salient andthen in a westerly direction to the north of Anneaux where joiningwith the 62nd the line was carried north of the Cambrai road forminganother salient north of the Sugar Factory The 36th Division thencarried on the line which bent back towards the road near the canalbridge and then forward again to Muvres Due west of Muvres the 56thDivision held the line to the old British trenches The Tanks indiminished numbers had assisted during the day but no advance hadbeen made without a struggle Line DIn the III Corps area there had been some heavy fighting during theday which resulted in some improvement of our positions Heavycounterattacks were launched by the enemy and much useful andgallant work was done by dismounted cavalry beating off these attacksBut the fortyeight hours had expired and the high ground at BourlonVillage and Wood as well as certain tactical features to the east andwest of the wood still remained in the enemys hands It seemedfairly clear that the surprise breakthrough and completedisorganisation of the enemys back areas would not be accomplishedSir Douglas Haig had to decide whether to continue the offensive or      183take up a defensive attitude and rest content with what had been done     It was not possible however to let matters stand as they     were The positions captured by us north of Flesquires were     completely commanded by the Bourlon Ridge and unless the     ridge were gained it would be impossible to hold them     except at excessive cost If I decided not to go on a     withdrawal to the Flesquires ridge would be necessary and     would have to be carried out at once     On the other hand the enemy showed certain signs of an     intention to withdraw Craters had been formed at road     junctions and troops could be seen ready to move east The     possession of Bourlon Ridge would enable our troops to     obtain observation over the ground to the north which     sloped gently down to the Sense River The enemys     defensive lines south of the Scarpe and the Sense Rivers     would thereby be turned his communications exposed to the     observed fire of our artillery and his positions in this     sector jeopardised In short so great was the importance of     the ridge to the enemy that its loss would probably cause     the abandonment by the Germans of their carefully prepared     defence systems for a considerable distance to the north of     it     It was to be remembered however that the hostile     reinforcements coming up at this stage could at first be no     more than enough to replace the enemys losses and although     the right of our advance had been definitely stayed the     enemy had not yet developed such strength about Bourlon as     it seemed might not be overcome by the numbers at my     disposal As has already been pointed out on the Cambrai     side of the battlefield I had only aimed at securing a     defensive flank to enable the advance to be pushed northwards       184     and northwestwards and this part of my task had been to a     large extent achieved     An additional and very important argument in favour of     proceeding with my attack was supplied by the situation in     Italy upon which a continuance of pressure on the Cambrai     front might reasonably be expected to exercise an important     effect no matter what measures of success attended my     efforts Moreover two divisions previously under orders for     Italy had on this day been placed at my disposal and with     this accession of strength the prospect of securing Bourlon     seemed good     After weighing these various considerations therefore I     decided to continue the operations to gain the Bourlon     positionBut in the morning about 930 am the enemy launched a heavycounterattack on the 62nd Division west of Bourlon Wood whichalthough it did not succeed in driving them back prevented anyadvance And about 1030 they attacked Fontaine from the northwestand east and after heavy fighting drove the 51st Division out andclear of the villageDuring the afternoon the Germans again attacked the 62nd Division butwere again repulsed as they had been in the morning On the left ofthe 62nd the 36th were unable to gain ground on the east of thecanal and on the west bank entered Muvres for the second time butafter an hour or so were driven out Line EOn this day the 22nd November the 56th Division played a moreimportant part The 169th Brigade were still on the right of thedivision The Queen Victorias Rifles in touch with the 109thBrigade were holding a line of posts across No Mans Land and in theold German outpost line The Queens Westminster Rifles were ordered     185to concentrate slightly to the north of the Cambrai road and toadvance in conjunction with the 109th Brigade at 11 oclock alongthe front trench of the Hindenburg Line which runs to Tadpole CopseThey would also work their way up the communication trenches to thesecond line of the Hindenburg first system and clear both lines asfar as Tadpole Copse The London Rifle Brigade were ordered toassemble in the captured Hindenburg Line south of the Cambrai roadand follow the attack of the 109th Brigade to where the Hindenburgsystem turned away from the canal at Muvres see Map they wouldthen follow the Queens Westminsters in two columns one in the firstline and one in the second and reinforce if necessary The 5000yards of British line up to the Hirondelle River were held by the167th BrigadeThe instructions were to carry out a determined advance The idea ofwhich this was the preliminary operation was for the 36th Division tomove forward through Muvres and Inchy while the 56th Divisioncaptured the Hindenburg Line up to QuantIt was entirely a bombing fight and was supported by an artillerybarrage which lifted off Swan Lane at 1130 am and moved forward atthe rate of fifty yards every five minutes The division until thenight 21st22nd had been covered by the 281st Brigade RFA onlyaswas usual in these battles the artillery was switched about from onecommand to anotherbut during the night the 280th Brigade RFA hadmoved to positions near Boursies and took part in this attackIt was hard and slow fighting as is generally the case in bombing       186fights Colonel Glazier of the Queens Westminsters writes     The barrage got some way ahead of our men but owing to the     uncertainty of the position of the troops it was impossible     to bring it back At 1230 pm a runner came with a request     for more bombs and the news that our men had passed the     BoursiesMuvres road and were using German bombs Bombs     were sent forward large quantities were taken forward by     the Queen Victorias RiflesNews of progress was very slow in coming in and the first definiteinformation indicating success was obtained from observers whoreported at 240 pm that the enemy were shelling Tadpole Copse Notuntil 530 was it known for certain that the copse was occupied bythree companies of the Queens Westminsters They captured 3 officers70 men and 3 machine gunsThe London Scottish had arrived at the old British front line aboutLouverval at midday with the object of relieving the QueensWestminsters and carrying on the attack They were informed that theattack would not be continued that day and so formed a flank from thesouth of Tadpole Copse to the old British line although for themoment they were unable to dislodge the enemy from a deep crater atthe road junctions some two hundred yards southwest of the copse Atdawn they relieved the forward companies of the Queens Westminstersand made ready for the morning attack  [Illustration 6 LOCAL MAP FRONT OF THE DIVISION AT CAMBRAI 1917]Most useful work was also done during the night by the 416th FieldCoy RE who constructed a bridge over the canal at the Cambrairoad although the enemy kept up a persistent shelling of the road      187and particularly of the point of intersection with the canal The512th Coy RE at the same time made good the road from Boursies tothe canalSo the only progress made by the IV Corps on the 22nd was the captureof Tadpole Copse by the Queens Westminsters an important gain as itoccupies the high ground to the west of Muvres But it becameapparent that the enemy was rapidly massing strong forces to stay ourfarther advanceThe 40th Division passed into the Corps command and was sent torelieve the 62nd The Corps orders that evening were for the advanceto continue on the 23rd with the assistance of Tanks the chiefobjective being Bourlon village The 51st Division was to attack itfrom the east and the 40th from the southwest but when it becameknown that the 51st Division had been driven out of Fontaine theirtask was modified to the recapture of that village The 36th and 56thDivisions were to continue the advance up the canal and roll up theHindenburg Support LineAll through the night there had been much shell fire on the 56thDivisional front Two counterattacks had been successfully repulsedOwing to darkness and the congested state of the trenches the LondonScottish were late in getting into their assembly positions but asthey were not to move until an hour and a half after zero 630 amwhich time was occupied by bombardment of the enemy positions it didnot matter     It was then found Colonel Jackson writes that the 169th     Brigade had not reached Tadpole Lane but the communication     trench running from front to support trench on the northwest       188     side of Tadpole Copse and that a fairly deep valley existed     between this communication trench and the InchyLouverval     road The Germans could thus directly enfilade the front and     support trenches with rifle and machinegun fire from the     other side of the valley where they had built strong blocks     and loopholes during the night The battalion was thus held     up at this point until 230 pm By this time D Company     had with the assistance of the Stokes Mortars 169th been     able to cross the valley face the block on the other side     and cross the Inchy road thus surrounding the enemy still     holding the block in the front line opposite B Company     Ten officers 69 other ranks 6 machine guns and 1 trench     mortarall of the 20th German DivisionIt would appear that the German counterattacks during the night hadgained some ground The valley alluded to by Colonel Jackson is notshown clearly on the British maps and is only indicated by the veryunsatisfactory sign of banks An imaginative person might havetraced the reentrant starting in square 7 right up to these banksbut it was not always wise to be too imaginative with the British mapat any rate the shape of the ground seems to have been a surpriseBy 430 pm the battalion had reached its objective Adelaide streetand was immediately strongly counterattacked The supply of bombsfailedit is extraordinary how many bombs can be thrown on suchoccasionsand the support line was lost as far as the Inchy road butthe front line was held In this counterattack the London Scottishwere reinforced by two companies of the 4th London Regt They wereordered to consolidateThe operations on the rest of the Corps front during the day resulted    189in fierce fighting through Bourlon Wood and the capture of Bourlonvillage by the 40th Division and a tremendous struggle for Fontaineinto which the 51st Division never really penetrated Repeated andheavy counterattacks forced the 40th Division out of Bourlon villageto the north edge of Bourlon Wood The 36th Division had captured andagain been forced out of Muvres and had not been able to make muchprogress on the east bank of the canal a failure which caused theposition of the 40th Division to become a somewhat isolated one Thegallant 51st Division which had been used in such ruthless fashionwas relieved by the Guards Division and went back to Albert Line FAt 1250 am on the 24th the Corps issued orders for the groundgained to be held at all costs The 40th Division were to consolidatetheir position and attack Bourlon village with the assistance oftwelve Tanks at noon The Guards Division were to consolidate the linetaken over from the 51st and the 36th and 56th Divisions to continuetheir clearing of the Hindenburg Line But as we have said the orderapplying to the 56th Division was subsequently cancelledThe 168th Brigade which was now in the centre of the division tookover a stretch of the old British front line from the 167th on theleft the forward position of the 169th was still in the HindenburgLine on the right The main strength of the division was concentratedof course about the Hindenburg Line to the west of Muvres while inthe old British line it was strung out and thin But the division as awhole was strengthened on the 24th by the addition of one brigade ofRoyal Horse ArtilleryAt three oclock in the afternoon the enemy again attacked under a       190very severe barrage and the London Scottish lost their hold on thesecond line of the first German system to the north of Tadpole Copsebut not without a strong fight The enemy came down all communicationtrenches at once while small parties of snipers advanced fromshellhole to shellhole over the open The attack was pressed soclosely that the supply of bombs could not be maintained and theLondon Scottish men had eventually to retire across the open Thefront line however was still held to a point opposite AdelaideStreetOn the night of the 24th the division passed from the IV Corps to theVI Corps But although the 56th Division passed from the IV Corps wemust not lose sight of the doings of that corps which continued topress towards the north with the 56th Division on its flank Duringthe day many attacks and counterattacks took place and in the endthe 40th Division retook the village of BourlonBy the morning of the 25th the London Scottish had been relieved bythe Rangers 12th London in view of an attack to regain the stretchof Hindenburg Line lost on the previous dayThe 4th London Regt were in position on the right and the Rangers12th on the left The 4th Londons holding the bit of the SecondLine north of Tadpole Copse were to bomb straight ahead while theRangers who were in the First Line would bomb up the communicationtrenches to the Second Line and join hands with the 4th Londons Theattack started at 1 pm and progressed very satisfactorily for awhile but the fighting was very hard and the men very tired The 4thLondon at one time reached the Inchy road but their arrival there       191seems to have coincided with a particularly violent effort of theenemy which caused the Rangers to call for protective artillery firethe artillery responded and the 4th London being in the zone of firehad to retire The attack which lasted until the evening ended witha small gain but left the Germans in possession of the banks aboutthe valley northwest of the copseOn the 25th the 40th Division was driven out of Bourlon village butretained the ridge running through Bourlon Wood They were relieved bythe 62nd during the night Three dismounted battalions of the 2ndCavalry Division were placed at the disposal of the IV Corps and didgood work during the next three days in Bourlon WoodBombfighting was carried on through the night about Tadpole Copse Wehave casually mentioned that the men were tired and on the 26th GenDudgeon represented to the Corps that he considered his division wastoo extended It had captured and was holding about one mile of theHindenburg system and until Muvres was captured his right flankwas in danger while his left flank on Tadpole Copse spur was notonly exposed but being constantly attacked Two brigades were involvedin the fighting about the Hindenburg system and in addition wereholding a flank 2000 yards long connecting up to the old Britishfront line The remaining brigade was holding 5500 yards of Britishline and had also to supply one battalion each night to work in thecaptured position There was therefore no divisional reserve norcould any reliefs be arranged for the troops who had been fightingThe VI Corps placed one battalion of the 3rd Division on the left atthe disposal of the 167th Brigade and this enabled the 8th Middlesex    192Regt to be placed at the disposal of the 168th Brigade which easedthe situation in the Hindenburg systemA heavy attack on the 27th was repulsed by the Rangers and theKensingtons and on the following two days there is nothing more torecord than heavy shellingThe 26th had been a quiet day for the IV Corps Certain reliefs werecarried out The 36th Division was replaced by the 2nd Division the1st Cavalry Division which had taken part in the fighting up to thistime was ordered to return to its own corps and the 47th Divisionwas ordered into the battle area east of the canalOn the 27th after a night of storm and snow the Guards and 62ndDivisions attacked Fontaine and Bourlon villages Though bothdivisions entered their objectives the positions were not held Theresources of the Army were considered to be almost exhausted at thisstage which was probably the reason for using only three battalionsof the Guards Division for this operationThe 59th Division was placed at the disposal of the IV Corps andrelieved the Guards on the next day while the 47th Division relievedthe weary 62nd And the Tanks were completely withdrawnThe battle had therefore petered out leaving a most unsatisfactorystate of affairs about Bourlon Wood and village the situationopposite Fontaine was also not good It will have been noticed thatafter the first rush the fighting was done by the IV Corps againstthe northern side of the salient which had been created and the IIICorps held an extended flank which at the junction with the VII Corps   193on their right was somewhat thinOn the face of it it seems as though the mind of the Third Army Staffwas concentrated on the doings of the IV Corps and the enemy oppositethem The Bourlon position had a mesmerising effect and even thoughthe III Corps was suddenly warned by the Army to expect an attack onthe 29th no very great preparation for such an event seems to havebeen made The divisions did all they could The 12th Division on theright of the Corps moved the two battalions in divisional reservenearer the line and organised all reinforcements and the 10 per centpersonnel left out of the line into a battalion about 850 strongOther divisions issued a warning to troops in the line The 55th onthe left of the VII Corps and next to the 12th sent out a long order     Certain indications during the day point to the possibility of     the enemy making an attack against our front All troops will be     warned to be specially on the alert in trenches and all posts     Special patrols will be sent out at 4 am to watch for enemy     movement Artillery will open fire on the enemy front line     commencing at 5 am The most likely places for concentration to     be selected by brigadiergenerals commanding infantry brigades in     consultation with group commanders In case of enemy attack all     posts and trenches will be held to the last at all costs and     there will be no retirement from any line to another line The     action of troops available for counterattack will be considered     now All machine guns will be warned to be specially on the     lookout for SOS signals From 5 am 29th inst 14th North     Lancs will be ready to move at halfhours notice from receipt     of orders Remainder of 164th Brigade will be ready to move         194     at one hours notice from the same timeOn the other hand the Guards and 62nd Divisions had already startedto move out of the salientNothing happened on the 29th but on the 30th the enemy launched a bigattack on the III and IV Corps with the intention of pinching off thesalient and capturing all the troops in the areaThe enemy broke through the III Corps the weight of his attack beingdirected at the junction of the 55th and 12th Divisions General H BScott commanding the 12th Division says     I do not consider that the troops in the front system were     in any way surprised In fact far from it as on some     portions there was a heavy bombardment and the Divisional     Artillery had opened fire on SOS lines at 630 am Also     on the evening of the 29th November warning had been sent to     all infantry brigades and the CRA that an attack was     possible on the eastern flank     In my opinion the troops in the centre of the 12th Division     were pushed back by the force of numbers The question of     the flanks being turned is another one for which I have no     evidence to show what actually happened to bring about those     situations From all accounts the flanks of the division     were turned before the troops vacated the Banteaux Spur and     Lateau Wood This is verified by those in the vicinity of     those places     The enemy had great facilities in assembling unknown to us     in Banteaux in the factory and in the wood Undoubtedly     these were the places he used The main attacks were I     consider made along the Banteaux Ravine keeping south of     the Banteaux Spur up the ravine from Banteaux to R23c in          195     the direction of la Vacquerie and from the factory and wood     in the valley north of Banteaux towards the western edge     of Bonavis Ridge     I am confident that the enemy suffered heavy losses     Undoubtedly he attacked in force and some must have been     caught by the artillery and machinegun barrage during the     assembly and the initial stages of his advance Besides     this there was much close fighting and many     counterattacksThe gallant 29th Division held on to Masnires like grim death andthe enemy never moved them an inch but he advanced as far asGouzeaucourt and was threatening Metz through which lay the only goodroad to the IV CorpsIt is not quite clear whether this was the main German attack or notAbout six divisions seem to have been used but judging by the lengthof the attack and its ferocity the big effort is indicated on theother side the northern side of the salientOn the north side of the salient the divisions ran the 59th the 47thLondon Territorials the 2nd and the 56th On the 56th Divisionalfront the brigades holding the captured Hindenburg system weredisposed as followsThe Queens Westminster Rifles on the right and the 2nd London Regton the left of the 169th Brigade front in the Hindenburg Line theLondon Rifle Brigade and Queen Victorias Rifles being in the oldBritish line behind themThe 168th Brigade reinforced by one battalion came next in theHindenburg Line with the 8th Middlesex attached on the right andthe London Scottish on the left and the 4th London Regt holding thedefensive flank back to the old British front line The Kensingtons      196were in support in the old British front line and the Rangers were atBeugnyThe 167th Brigade had been relieved by the 3rd Division and hadmarched back to FremicourtAt about 10 oclock in the morning the 2nd Division who were astridethe canal holding the ground won by the 36th Division reported aheavy concentration of the enemy on the east of Quarry Wood betweenthe wood and the canal and just behind Muvres also a divisionentering Muvres itself But before this mass of troops was reportedthe London Scottish 8th Middlesex and Queens Westminster Rifles hadnoticed unusual happenings in the enemy linesThe enemy had started registration by aeroplane which caused otherobservers than sentries to be on the watch And then it was seen thatthe Germans were wearing steel helmets instead of the usual soft capsThe aerial activity increased and soon heavy enemy fire was openedbetween Muvres and Bourlon The registration on the 56th Divisionalfront was followed by slow steady bombardment which increased untilabout a quarter to ten a heavy barrage crashed down on the wholefront It was obvious that an attack was impending and the SOSrockets were sent upThe enemy barrage which consisted of light howitzers field guns andtrench mortars was particularly heavy on the blocks in the capturedcommunication trenches Gradually the German guns lifted and at 1015am the enemy swarmed forward to the attack  [Illustration 7 THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI]A glance at the map will show the precarious position not only of the56th Division and neighbouring units but of the whole of the Third      197Army troops engaged in the salient South of the salient the Germanswere through our lines and if they broke through in the north anunparalleled disaster would be inflicted on the British Army TheGermans tried hard During the day no less than five set attacks werelaunched the heaviest with eleven lines of infantry advancing insuccession to the assault We wish to emphasise the position of the IVand III Corps and the general situation in the salient for if the56th Division failed to stand fast and we know they could not becalled fresh troops the fate of the two Corps was sealed On noportion of the front attacked could the Germans hope to gain a greatersuccess than on the part held by the 56th DivisionThe intricate nature of the Hindenburg Line although it afforded theattackers cover for assembly close up to the troops of the 56thDivision had its disadvantages Small bodies of defenders couldinflict incalculable loss and though surrounded could break up theattack so that it only trickled through feebly but of course theymust be good menThe 56th proved themselves once more to be good men The Germanstorming parties were most cleverly supported by their trench mortarsand field artillery A deluge of shells descended on the posts holdingthe blocks in the communication trenches and the enemy infantrysupplemented the bombardment with rifle grenades The artillery liftedslowly and as it moved so the infantry assembled at the other sideof the blocks leapt out on the parapet and attempted to rush thedefending post At the same time other infantry advanced over the openfrom the main trenchesWith such a short distance between opposing troops one might well        198suppose that this form of attack would succeed It was sudden it wasconfusing inasmuch as Germans appeared everywhere But the men of the56th Division showed the most astonishing the most praiseworthycalmness The training of the division in the new organisation withplatoons composed of rifle bombing rifle grenadier and Lewisgunsections combined with the coolness of the men now bore fruitVolleys from the rifle grenadier sections shook the Germans as theyemerged from their trenches the riflemen picked off individuals whowere getting too close Lewis guns sited to sweep enemy avenues ofapproach sent streams of bullets into the mass of the enemy andwhere the Germans succeeded in reaching the trenches they had to dealwith the bombersIn the tremendous battle that followed the Stokes mortar batteriessupported their comrades in exemplary fashion The most strikingindividual work of all that was done by these batteries was thatcarried out by Corporal Macintosh of the 168th Battery This corporalhad done extraordinarily good work on the 24th but on this occasionhe surpassed his previous record Captain Crawford writes of his utterdisregard for his personal safety of his standing exposed not onlyto the fire of artillery and trench mortars but the more deadlysniper calmly directing the fire of his gun where it was mosturgently needed And what of Private Woods     Private Woods had been forced to withdraw his gun from its     original position and in doing so he lost the stand He     took up a new position with another gun and carried on             199     firing incessantly and later when the stand of his gun was     giving way through excessive firing continued to use the     primary ammunition on the enemy whilst holding the barrel of     the gun between his legsThe Germans attacked with the greatest determination and pressedforward with a multitude of men Posts all along the front line weregradually surrounded but the grim steadfast fierceness of the men ofthe 56th Division was doing its work The enemy losses were appallingThe losses of the 56th Division were great and where gaps occurredthe enemy slipped through They appeared in the front line thesupport line of the Hindenburg front system on the right in thecentre on the left Hard fighting had reached the second line of theQueens Westminsters and the 2nd Londons Col Pank of the 8thMiddlesex was in his headquarter dugout situated in the supportline German front line when he was told the enemy was in the frontline he ordered his runners signallers everybody to man the trenchoutside and leading the way himself clambered out of one entranceto the dugout while the Germans threw bombs down the other Col Pankslipped down the communication trench which ran to the old Germanoutpost line and gathering together the first men he could find ofhis support company with a supply of bombs led them back to attackThe London Scottish were on the extreme left holding the old Germanfront line through Tadpole Copse and across the Inchy road andtherefore a continuation of the 8th Middlesex second line ColJackson was suddenly startled by finding the enemy in his line Butthe fierce attack led by Col Pank shook the enemy and though the       200London Scottish had their hands fairly full on their front and leftflank they dealt with the party in their trench Col Pank thencleared the whole of his section of the old German front line Thiswas the point of deepest penetration by the enemy and was reachedsomewhere about one oclockWe must point out that dugouts in this line were far from comfortablequarters Their positions were naturally known to the Germans and theywere continually bombarded with enormous trench mortars said to be12inch In the expressive language of the Cockney they were bumpedfrom morning to night To get some idea of the effect of these engineson those in the dugouts we need only say that each explosionextinguished all the candles and left the occupants in darknessThe Kensingtons had been sent up to Barbican the sunken road in NoMans Land as reinforcements but in view of the uncertainty of theposition they were ordered to remain thereOne cannot hope to give a detailed account of attack andcounterattack in this mass of trenches Every hour brought a newsituation now in our favour now against us The Queens Westminstersand the 2nd Londons had suffered severe casualties Everywhere theline stood firm in the old German front line Two companies of theLondon Rifle Brigade had reinforced the Queens Westminsters andthree companies of the Queen Victorias Rifles had gone to the 2ndLondons Practically the whole of the 169th Brigade was engaged andgradually they wore down the German attackThe message Am holding onhard pressed came by pigeon and runner      201with distressing frequency The Rangers were put under the orders ofthe 169th Brigade The remaining battalions of the 167th Brigade andthe 5th Cheshires were marching towards the battle The SOS wassignalled by the London Scottish at 4 pm At 6 pm fierce bombingwas still going on in all trenches forwardThe position was that the 169th and 168th Brigades held the old Germanfront line with blocks in all the communication trenches running tothe second line The Queens Westminsters in touch with the 2ndDivision on the right 2nd London and 8th Middlesex on whom thegreatest weight of the attack had fallen had lost the old Germansecond line the London Scottish faced with the flank of the Germanattack but nevertheless a hotly pressed attack had lost no groundOn this day the Divisional Artillery had fired on SOS linescontinuously from soon after ten in the morning until six at night Anumber of fleeting targets and enemy batteries were also engaged withgood results The Germans attempted to press forward with theirbatteries in fact they believed they were going to break throughand the batteries could be seen galloping into action On oneoccasion about 1 pm a brigade of three German 77mm batteriesraced into the open and were engaged so swiftly by the 280th BrigadeRFA that only one battery was able to get off a round before beingknocked out As usual the 56th Divisional Artillery supported thegallantry of the infantry with equal gallantry and determinationThe German counterbattery fire had increased rapidly every day fromthe commencement of the operations gas being used chiefly at night     202But at no time did it reach anything like the same intensity as wasexperienced on the Ypres front or even on the Somme Hostile aircraftwere very active flying low over the front line and battery positionsduring the latter part of the battle and on two or three occasionsthey hindered batteries in the open by machinegunning their crewswhen they were firing on SOS linesOn the right of the 56th Division and on the west side of the canalthe 6th Brigade 2nd Division stood firmly in line with the 56th Theattack on the east of the canal fell on the 99th Brigade of the 2ndDivision and the 140th Brigade of the 47th Division holding the crestof the ridge running from Bourlon Wood to the BapaumeCambrai roadThe attack came on time after time only to be hurled back by thefire of the guns and the machine guns and the fine fighting of theinfantry Fullstrength attacks were delivered at 930 am 1125am and at 230 pm but the enemy gained nothing more than a fewadvanced posts and an advance of about 300 yards near Bourlon WoodThe situation in the morning had been a precarious one indeed thegreatest anxiety prevailed throughout the day The Guards Division hadstopped the German rush on the south side of the salient during theearly afternoon but if the 56th 2nd and 47th Divisions had notstood firm on the northern side the Third Army would have suffered aheavy defeat There were some frantic telegrams sent at times At1030 am the 2nd 47th 59th and 62nd Artillery were ordered to beprepared to move their guns from the Graincourt Valley and to havetheir teams up in readiness but these same guns did fearful execution  203The 47th Division reported at 1135 am Waves attacking over crestF21 Fontaine held up by our barrage which is very accurate Ourguns have broken up concentration on E16 west of Bourlon Wood Densewaves moving along crest E to W Our guns apparently drawing themBut the relief felt by the General Staff found expression in a bookletentitled The Story of a Great Fight Being an account of theoperations of the 47th 2nd and 56th Divisions in the neighbourhoodof Bourlon Wood and Muvres on the 30th November 1917 We canonly give extracts which concern us     The 56th Division had been in line prior to the British     attack of the 20th November in which its right brigade had     taken part and since that date had captured and held about     a mile of the Hindenburg Line west of Muvres including     Tadpole Copse Almost constant fighting had taken place in     this area since our attack and the division which at one     time had been holding a front of 11000 yards had already     been subjected to a very severe strain The story of the     subsequent fighting on the BourlonMuvres front is one so     brimful of heroism that it deserves to take its place in     English history for all time The most determined attacks of     four German divisions with three other German divisions in     support were utterly crushed by the unconquerable     resistance of the three British divisions in line The 30th     November 1917 will be a proud day in the lives of all     those splendid British soldiers who by their singlehearted     devotion to duty prevented what would have become a serious     situation had they given way At 920 am the enemy had     been seen advancing from the north towards the Canal du     Nord and subsequently attack after attack was delivered by         204     him on both sides of the canal against the 6th and 169th     Infantry Brigades South of Muvres the enemy succeeded in     gaining an entry but was driven back by a bombing attack     after heavy fighting From Muvres westward to Tadpole     Copse a desperate struggle was taking place for the     possession of the Hindenburg Line in the course of which     the enemy at one time reached the Battalion Headquarters of     the 8th Middlesex Regt attached to the 168th Brigade 56th     Division Here the German infantry were stopped by the     gallant defence of the officer commanding the battalion     who with the assistance of his headquarters staff held off     the enemy with bombs until further help was organised and     the trench regained Though much reduced in strength by the     fighting of the preceding days and hardpressed by superior     forces the troops of the 168th and 169th Brigades beat off     all attacks Queens Westminsters London Scottish and the     men of the 12nd Bn London Regt and 18th Bn Middlesex     Regt vied with one another in the valour of their     resistance At the end of this day of high courage and     glorious achievement except for a few advanced positions     some of which were afterwards regained our line had been     maintained intact The men who had come triumphantly through     this mighty contest felt and rightly felt that they had     won a great victory in which the enemy had come against     them in full strength and had been defeated with losses at     which even the victors stood aghastThe survivors will at least agree that when General Headquarters tookthe trouble to print anything of this sort it had been well earnedDuring the night of the 30th November reliefs took place On the 169thBrigade front the London Rifle Brigade relieved the QueensWestminsters and the 3rd London attached relieved the 2nd London      205On the 168th Brigade front the Rangers relieved the London Scottishand the 1st London the 8th Middlesex The Queens Westminsters and the2nd London being the most worn troops were sent into the divisionalreserve at Louverval while the rest occupied the old British lineThe reliefs were not complete until 5 am on the 1st DecemberAt about 330 pm the enemy commenced a heavy bombardment of thetrenches held in the Hindenburg Line and the SOS went up Frommovement noticed beforehand on the northwest of Tadpole Copse itseemed likely that he would attack again but the attempt if it wasto be made was crushed by the artilleryOn the night of the 1st December the 51st Division started to relievethe 56th but so as not to involve the 51st Division until thefollowing night the front line was not relieved before the night ofthe 2nd DecemberGen Dudgeon makes some interesting remarks on the battle     Although up to Z day the rle of the division was to attack     with Tanks over the open the fighting which developed was     almost entirely trench fighting with bombs No shortage of     bombs occurred but the men employed at the divisional dump     eleven men worked day and night detonating and at one     time the Divisional Artillery Column echlon had to be drawn     on     It was found that pigeon messages were very slow probably     owing to the season of the year Trench wireless sets were     used with success from positions within 200 yards of the     enemy being erected only at night and dismantled by day           206     The reliable method of communication was by runner from the     captured trenches to our old line viz over about 2300     yards of No Mans Land and a series of relay posts was     arranged     The 168th Brigade with the help of on an average two     companies 15th Cheshire Regt and one battalion 167th     Brigade occasional help dug a communication trench      about 1500 yards This trench being rather in line with     the Inchy road was somewhat subject to shell fire 169th     Brigade also with the help of one company of Pioneers and     one Field Company dug a trench  1300 yards which was     less shelled The Barbican and Houndsditch provided some     shelter but in most cases reinforcements and supplies had     to go over the open in full view of Muvres from which it     was impossible to obtain concealmentDuring these operations the 56 machine guns in the division twocompanies of 16 guns and two companies of 12 guns were used asfollows With each infantry brigade 8 guns in Divisional Pool 32guns The 32 guns of the pool were employed on the 20th inst inbarrage work outside the divisional area to cover the attack of the36th and 62nd Divisions They returned to divisional control on thenight of the 20th November On the 21st and subsequent days theheadquarters of the Divisional Pool were in a central position inBeaumetz On subsequent days the guns in the pool were used forprotection of the flank a maximum of 10 guns were employed on thisprotective barrage on the Hindenburg Line and on the HindenburgSupport machinegun defence behind the infantryWe have mentioned the word mystery with regard to the battle of        207Cambrai and the handling of the cavalry Though they fought on footwith the best at Bourlon Wood and Villers Guislan there seems to havebeen some hesitation on the first day of the battle It is howeverdebatable whether they could have done much Of the other mysteriesthe success of the Germans on the southern side of the salient is oneEarly in the proceedings General Sir OD Snow commanding the VIICorps is reported to have placed his fingers on a map at the point ofTwentytwo Ravine and said If I were a German I should attackthere No attempt was ever made to reinforce divisions before theGerman counterattack although the Army was aware that one wasthreatened And this brings us to another mystery Sir Douglas Haigrepeats several times in his dispatch a suggestion that he had a verylimited number of troops at his command But we know that he had theoffer of French troops He closes his account of the fighting on the30th November by recording     my obligation to the CommanderinChief of the French     Armies for the prompt way in which he placed French troops     within reach for employment in case of need at the     unfettered discretion of the Third Army Commander Part of     the artillery of this force actually came into action     rendering valuable service and though the remainder of the     troops were not called upon the knowledge that they were     available should occasion arise was a great assistanceOne naturally asks the question What would have happened if Frenchtroops had been used even as late as the 21st November If they werestill too far away there were undoubtedly British divisions quite       208close up and quite fresh which could have been used to press the firstgreat advantage gained and the French would still have been in handas a reserveCasualties from the 20th November to the 3rd December were 9 officerskilled 202 other ranks killed 43 officers and 1003 other

There were one ortwo bickerings between patrols but nothing of importance And soChristmas Day was passed with the division still in lineOn the 26th December General Swift USA and his Chief of

year 1917 must be carried in the mind sothat the new situation can be appreciated In the month of Februarythe Germans had started an unrestricted Uboat campaign and Americahad broken off diplomatic relations with her War was not declaredbetween these two countries until April and as an immediateconsequence it influenced the plans of the Entente and Central Powersaccording to the time which in the judgment of either it would be      211possible for America to make her strength feltThe Entente Powers looked upon America as a reserve upon which theycould count in twelve months time or slightly over They were freeto undertake large operations with ambitious objects provided theydid not either break their armies or so reduce them in strength as torender their resisting power unequal to any sudden German attackOn the other hand the Central Powers had to do something before theAmerican troops arrived and gave the balance of power definitely tothe EntenteAlthough American action in the future was the deciding factor theformation of plans could not rest entirely on such a directcalculation At first it seemed that the Entente had no reason tothink that the abdication of the Tsar would mean the defection ofRussia and the Central Powers could only hope to delay the AmericanArmies by their Uboats But the Russian debacle began with her defeatin Galicia in the latter part of July and it soon became evident tothe Entente that they would before the American forces could be usedhave to fight for their existence They had it is true brought theCentral Powers offensive in Italy which had threatened to cause adisaster to a standstill but the Bolshevist coup dtat in Russiain November had brought visions of an overwhelming mass of Germantroops moving to the west December January and February were gloomymonths of speculation which culminated in a state of nervousapprehension in MarchDuring the first half of the year the Central Powers had not much tocongratulate themselves upon Baghdad was captured in March The         212battles of Arras in April and of Messines in June were sudden anddefinite blows which shook them and though the Ypres battles in 1917were a most costly affair to the British the German losses had beensufficiently heavy to create consternation Well might Ludendorffutter a cry of elation when events in Russia opened prospects of anearly release of the German armies on that front He no longerbelieved in the assurance of the German Navy that the Uboats wouldneutralise American effort but he saw a chance of victory before thefatal date of effective American interventionHe and the FieldMarshal Hindenburg must have known that they wouldhave to make the last fatal throw and that there was barely time torattle the dice Austria was done worn out exhausted It wasdoubtful whether she could stand against the Italians Allenby underwhom the 56th Division had fought in April had gone to Egypt in Juneand by December had captured Jerusalem and Turkey at the end of hertether lay at his mercy events in this theatre of war might move sofast as to bring disaster from that direction on the Central PowersThe Bulgarians were not trusted And there were signs that the GermanArmy itself had lost its arrogant spiritHindenburg could count on a preponderance of numbers on the WesternFront but desertions were appalling in number Tens of thousands weare told crossed the frontiers into neutral countries and a greatmany more stayed at home tacitly tolerated by their fellowcitizensand completely unmolested by the authoritiesThe movement of troops from east to west was carried out rapidly By     213the New Year the Germans had a majority of thirty divisions over theEntente on the Western Front The plan was to attack with fifty tosixty divisions under massed artillery varying between twenty andthirty batteries to each kilometre of front attacked and a multitudeof trench mortars as wellMeanwhile American troops were arriving and training in the backareas                                         The 56th Divisional Artillery had remained in the Muvres sectorBrigGen Elkington and his headquarters had however moved with theinfantry and we quote from the Brigadiers diary     The headquarters of the division and the RA were     established in huts in Victory Camp and I took over command     of the RA covering the division on the 8th [December] On     the 17th and 18th the 56th Divisional Artillery returned to     the division and took over in the line This part of the     front was at the time a very quiet one but much harassing     fire was done and a certain amount of enemy counterbattery     work was done on the battery positions Work was begun on     rear lines and rear battery positions Very cold weather was     experienced in December     We remained in this sector with headquarters at Victory     Camp which consisted of Nissen huts and was the coldest and     bleakest spot I encounteredit was a desperately cold     winter From the 1st to the 3rd January an American General     and his staff officers were attached to the division and     went round battery positions and saw some shooting On the     5th January the 62nd Divisional Infantry relieved the 56th     Divisional Infantry and on the 7th and 8th the RA of the     62nd Division came and looked over the batteries in the line     On the 9th January the 62nd Divisional Artillery relieved           214     the 56th Divisional Artillery and I handed over to the     CRA our batteries going back to the area round Berles     for rest and training the infantry having moved to the     VillersChatel area The RA Headquarters was established     for the first four days at Bertincourt and afterwards at     the chteau at Berles a very comfortable billet owned by a     French Count who was very hospitable and glad to see us and     did everything he could to make us comfortable Inspection     and training of batteries took place but this was greatly     hampered by the bad and severe weatherTraining of the infantry was owing to the weather not very ardentduring the divisional rest from the 9th January to the 11th FebruaryBut it was a welcome restBritish strength on the Western Front was now on the downward gradeFrom January divisions were cut down to nine battalions and from the30th of that month we must say goodbye to the 1st Battalion of theRangers the 1st Battalion of the Queen Victorias Rifles and the13rd London Regt The headquarters and transport of these battalionsjoined the 58th Division and were incorporated in the 2nd Battalionsof their respective regiments The 56th Division retained a certainnumber of the men who were split up as follows Queen VictoriasRifles 5 officers and 150 other ranks

of the division totheir 2nd BattalionSo far as the infantry were concerned the fortyseven divisions onthe Western Front in March 1918 were reduced by a quarterthis isexclusive of the Canadian and Australian divisions which retainedtheir original strength and includes the 41st Division whichreturned from Italy on the 2nd MarchThe relief of the 62nd Division by the 56th started on the 8thFebruary and on the 11th Gen Dudgeon took over command of the lineMeanwhile the wind was whistling through the chteaux of the HigherCommand The severe cold and the snow at Christmas and thecommencement of the New Year was followed by a thaw and a lot of rainThe result was that most of the trenches fell in A period of feverishactivity followed engineers and pioneers were working every nightand the infantry had to provide as many men as was possible Graduallythe defences were reconstructed and new ones added All this activitymingled with orders and provisions for retirement was greeted by thetroops with characteristic jeersWe do not wish to contribute to the general abuse which was levelledat the heads of the Staff or Red Tabsthe arrangements made onthis front at least were justified by the resultsbut we desire togive as far as we can the feeling of the private soldier andregimental officerArrangements for retreat shock the troops in much the same way as a      216coarse expression might shock a drawingroom full of ladies They areoffended They ask the question Whats the idea And although theycould not enumerate the difficulties of a gradual retirement theyseem to sense the fearful responsibility that is being thrust uponthem And the very nature of the situation caused orders to be givenwhich suggested uncertainty and indecision The private soldierspoint of view was simple he wanted to be given orders to fight on acertain spot but to change the spot where he should fight annoyedhimThe system which was adopted to meet the onslaught of the Germans wasto spread the defence over a wide belt of country The frontlinesystem was not to be held it was to be occupied by outposts whoseduty was to watch the enemy and retire on the next line if heattacked The fight itself was to take place in what was called thebattle zone and behind was yet another line through which the enemymust pass before our defence was broken If the Germans penetratedthese lines they might be said to have broken our first system ofdefenceBehind the 56th Division were other defences on which it might fallback but we are only concerned with the first systemAs to the general distribution of forces to meet the German offensiveonehalf of the British strength was devoted to protecting the Channelports and the rest was thinly dispersed over the remaining front Itmust be remembered that additional front amounting to 28 miles hadbeen taken over by the British in January and that Sir Douglas Haigwas now responsible for 125 miles In view of this length of line and    217the extreme importance of the Channel ports the general dispositionof troops would seem to have been wiseThe Germans claim to have effected a surprise in March 1918acontention which is scarcely justified In his interesting lengthybut somewhat vague account of the assembly of the great attackingforce Ludendorff says that ammunition dumps had been increased allalong the British front that movement of troops was carried out atnight but that German aviators sent up to report could see signs ofconcentration on the area chosen for attack which the blind Englishwere unable to perceive This is not accurate but one mustadmit that the German concentration and preparation were superblydoneWe knew that a general movement of troops from east to west had beenstarted in November and that roads and railways were being improvedartillery increased and ammunition accumulated all along the frontfrom Flanders to the Oise and by the end of February indicationsbecame apparent that the attack would be on the Third and FifthArmiesOn the 19th March the Intelligence Department reported to Sir DouglasHaig that the enemy preparations on the ArrasSt Quentin front werecomplete and that the attack would probably be launched on the 20th or21stLudendorff assumes that nor did the enemy discover anything by othermeans  otherwise his defensive measures would have been moreeffective and his reserves would have arrived more quickly In thishis claim of surprise might seem to be justified although the chargecan be met by a statement of the considerations which influenced SirDouglas Haig through this anxious period he could give up no ground     218in the northern portion of the British area where the Channel portswere threatened and he knew that the ground was exceptionally dry andthat preparations for an attack had been almost completed from thedirection of Menin the same applied to the centre behind which laythe collieries of northern France and important tactical featurescovering his lateral communications in the south in the Somme areaground could be given up to a certain extent without seriousconsequencesThe dispositions of British troops according to the aboveconsiderations had an effect on the Germans for Ludendorff tells usthat when deciding on the front to be attacked he was faced withstrong forces about Ypres that the condition of the centre the LysValley would not admit an attack before April which was late in viewof the Americans that an attack in the direction of Verdun wouldlead into very hilly country and that in making his final decisionshe was influenced by the time factor and the weakness of the enemyDuring the early part of 1918 the whole of the British force inforward areas was concerned with the problem of defence It was not acheerful period Closely typewritten sheets of paper flew about in alldirections giving instructions making amendments to previousinstructions calling for suggestions and ever warning commandersagainst attack The Cheshire Regt and the Engineers of the 56thDivision worked night and day at improving rear lines and constructingalternative ones fatigue parties were called for from battalions bothin and out of the line machine gunners and trenchmortar experts movedrestlessly from point to point selecting possible emplacements for      219their guns and the artillery did the same farther backThe men in the line were always the coolest in the whole of the armybut the officers were gradually being worked up to a state of feverishanxiety and a certain amount of bewildermentOn the 9th March the Kensingtons carried out a smart and successfulraid killing about 20 and capturing 4 Germans The prisoners statedthat the German offensive was imminent Orders were issued for battlepositions to be manned at 5 am as from the 13thAnother raid by the London Rifle Brigade on the 16th was hung up in amass of uncut wire but 2Lieut Kite Powell hacked his way throughand followed by four men managed to enter the German line and killhalf a dozen of them They secured no prisoner still the informationthat the enemy front line was strongly held and that they were veryalert was of valueAeroplane activity was very great from the 18th onwards and a greatdeal of individual movement was seen behind the enemy lines Harassingfire by the 56th Divisional Artillery was increased and with a goodpercentage of gas shells The enemy seemed to give a great deal ofattention to our wire with his trench mortars during the increasingbursts of artillery fireOn the 21st March with one tremendous crash the great battle openedon a front of 44 miles the artillery bombardment including the frontheld by the 56th Division But the attack was launched farther southbetween La Fre and CroisellesNo less than 68 German divisions took part in the battle on the first    220day many more than the whole of the British Army contained Thetraining carried out in some cases behind the Russian front had beenso complete as to include the practising of infantry behind an actuallive barrage The result was admirable Swarms of men followedresolutely and closely by artillery broke through the Fifth and theright of the Third Armies which were composed of a total force of 29infantry divisions and 3 cavalry divisionsThe German 17th Army composed of 24 divisions attacked north ofCambrai the 2nd Army of 17 divisions immediately south of Cambraiand the 18th Army of 27 divisions carried the attack down to LaFreThe 2nd and 18th German Armies made good progress against the BritishFifth Army but the resistance of our Third Army limited the enemyssuccess so that the 17th German Army was not able to cut off theFlesquires salient near Cambrai as had been planned But during thenight of 22nd23rd March the Fifth Army was back at Peronne and therewas a deep bulge in the Third Army towards Bapaume On the 27th theGerman line ran through Albert and Montdidier But the right of theGerman 17th Army was not too comfortableArras must be swept asideBehind Arras the wildest excitement prevailed The word panic ahumiliating word can be applied But as we have said before therewas always a zone of calmness and that zone was the forward zone Hadthe London men of the 56th Division been able to see the scurryingmotors and anxious faces of the soft job men behind them they would   221have been amazed But the 56th Division just went on with theordinary somewhat strenuous routine which had been instituted at thecommencement of the year strengthening the defences putting outwire arranging blocks constructing emplacements for machine gunsand trench mortars Being however on the flank of the XIII Corpsregimental officers were subjected to the annoyance of frequentchanges of orders and plansOn the 19th March an order was given for the 56th Division to alterthe method of holding the line from a threebrigade front to atwobrigade front Each of the two frontline brigades would have twobattalions in line and one in reserve and the division would have anentire brigade in reserve The necessary moves were made on the nightof 21st22nd MarchAn order was issued on the 20th that the division would be relieved bythe 62nd Division but this was cancelled on the 21st On the 22nd afurther warning order was given that the division would be relieved bythe 2nd Canadian Division and this also was cancelled on the 23rdThe situation of the Third Army on the right of the 56th Divisionbrought a multitude of instructions On the 22nd the XVII Corps hadbeen ordered to withdraw to its third system on the south of theScarpe but to continue holding Monchy lightly But north of theScarpe the 4th Division on the right of the 56th would not moveuntil Monchy had been captured by the enemy in which case the 56thDivision would adjust their line to run through Beatty Post BailleulPost to le Point du Jour Post General Matheson commanding the 4thDivision did not however intend to move unless definitely ordered     222to do so and if attacked would fight in three successive lines thelast bringing him to the Point du Jour PostThis last assurance of General Matheson was of a nature to simplifythe possible actions of officers of the 56th Division and waswelcome That the enemy was going to do something was becomingevident At 530 pm on the 23rd he exploded a land mine under thewire in front of Towy Post and appeared to be manning the lineopposite the divisional front thicker than usual Harassing fire wasturned on the German trenches and the reserve brigade was ordered tostand to at 5 am in futureIn the south the Germans were now approaching Albert and Roye Allsorts of rumours were flying about behind the lines On the 24th the169th Brigade captured a wounded German and he was sent forexamination in the early morning of the 25th He said that the 101stReserve and 102nd Reserve Regiments belonging to the 219th and 23rdReserve Divisions had occupied the Wotan Stellung behind the frontline on the night of the 24th These divisions had come from Rigaand would attack on the 26th together with the 240th and 5th BavarianReserve Divisions They were to advance to a depth of four kilometreswith the right flank on Oppy and then swing round towards Vimy Thebattalion section of the 471st Regt had already 60 trench mortars inposition and 8 more trench mortar companies were to arrive on thenight of the 25th The ammunition was already in the line One mayimagine that Gen Dudgeons conference at 630 pm was far from adull affairThe artillery were ordered to fire on chosen targets through the         223night and patrolling was activeA great deal of movement had been seen throughout the day of men andlight railways Troops were seen detraining at VitryAnd that night there was an interbattalion relief on the right theQueens Westminsters relieving the 2nd London The party sent torelieve Gavrelle Post found it occupied by two dead men onlytheremainder of the garrison had entirely disappeared Signs of astruggle were there but no one on either flank had reported the postbeing attacked and apparently nothing unusual had been seenGen Dudgeon ordered both brigades to do their utmost to secure aGerman prisoner Every effort was made but the enemy was found morethan ever on the alert with parties lying out to catch patrols It iscurious that one patrol reported the enemy repairing their wireit isprobable that they were cutting it downThe attack was coming and Divisional Headquarters strained everynerve to direct encourage and advise for the struggle Some of theorders are not too easy to understand and one is of interest as anexample of rumour being accepted as factThe artillery of course was very busy and we find an instruction tocut German wire and to keep the gaps open And the order we refer toas being founded on rumour was as follows In view possibleappearance enemy agents warn all ranks against use of wordRETIRE Any person using this word before or during an attackto be shot This was no doubt based on a muchcirculated statementthat the Fifth Army debacle was largely due to German agents dressed    224as British officers giving the order to retire We cannot believe ina swarm of disguised GermansIt must however have been a very weighty consideration which inducedthe Higher Command to order an extension of divisional front on the27th General Sir H de Lisle better known as the commander of the29th Division and now in command of the XIII Corps was ordered totake over the line to the Souchez River on his left This meant thatthe 56th Division had to relieve the 3rd Canadian Division on theleft at Tommy and Arleux Posts during the night of 27th28th MarchAt the same time the division was again ordered to treat the frontline as an outpost line and to fight on the line between Ditch Postand Willerval South But at the last moment the front line was orderedto be held as such so as to conform with the 4th Division on theright the 56th Division was already so stretched out that thiscurious eleventhhour change did not make much differenceThe Vimy Ridge lay behind the division but the ground they fought onwas not level The 4th Division on the right was on high ground andGavrelle lay in a slight depression the ground rose again towardsBailleul East Post and fell once more in the direction of Oppy Thedivision was however on a forward slope which gave them goodobservation from a somewhat exposed position see map contoursThe rearrangement of the line which took place during the night gavethe Queens Westminsters the right holding Towy Post and GavrellePost with one company while the other three companies held postsdefending Naval Trench The London Rifle Brigade held Mill Bradfordand Bird Posts with two companies and one platoon the remainder of      225the battalion holding posts on the Marine Trench line The thirdbattalion of the brigade the 2nd London Regt held the DitchBailleul and Bailleul East line Behind them in the Farbus line wasone company of the 5th Cheshire Regt and in reserve the 169thBrigade held two companies of the 1st London Regt attached from the167th Brigade and a detachment of the 176th Tunnelling Company whowere in the Point du Jour PostThe 168th Brigade on the left held Beatty Wood and Oppy Posts withtwo companies of the 4th London Regt and two in support on the lineDuke Street and Tommy and Arleux Posts with the Kensingtons twocompanies in the front line and in supportThe actual distribution of troops on the left is not very clear asthe redistribution was not complete when at 3 am on the 28th Marchthe enemy opened a furious bombardment We find a note that the LondonRifle Brigade had not at that hour relieved Bailleul East Post andthat one company of the 1st Canadian Rifles were still holding SugarPost This latter company remained at Sugar Post throughout thebattle being placed with that complete disregard of all except thewinning of the battle which characterised the Canadians under theorders of the 168th Brigade But the London Scottish were also in thisSugar PostWillerval line In the Farbus line were two platoons of the5th Cheshires and behind them in the Point du JourRidge Post linetwo companies of the 1st London Regt and one and a half companies ofthe 5th CheshiresThe two remaining battalions of the 167th Brigade and three field        226companies of Royal Engineers were in Divisional ReserveThe opening of a modern battle is with few exceptions a matter ofartillery BrigGen Elkingtons diary gives us some interestingfacts     On the morning of the 28th March the 56th Division was     holding a line south of Gavrelle to Arleux a front of about     5000 yards To cover this front the fieldguns under the     command of the division consisted of the 56th Divisional     Artillery and 9 guns of the 52nd Army Field Artillery     Brigade or 45 18pounders and 12 45 howitzers Six 6inch     Newton mortars were in action in the firstline system and     three were covering the BailleulWillerval line that is our     main line of resistance Of the former only two were     manned as all the ammunition at the other mortars had been     expended previously in accordance with orders which later     on were cancelled but not before the ammunition had been     expended     Between 3 am and 320 am the Germans put down a heavy     barrage of gas and HE shells of all calibres on the     BailleulWillerval line and the support line At 4 am the     barrage increased over the whole of the frontline system     and our posts were heavily bombarded with trench mortars     From 6 am the hostile barrage of all calibres was heavily     concentrated on the front line and continued to be intense     on this area until 715 am     During the above periods that is from 3 am until 715     am our artillery was firing heavily on the enemys front     system of trenches special concentrations being put down     in cooperation with the heavy artillery on lines of     organised shellholes It was considered at the time that     these shellholes were temporary trenchmortar emplacements     but from information given by prisoners after the attack           227     it appears likely that they were the assembly positions of     the assaulting troops From 645 am onwards counter     preparation was put into effect At 715 am the hostile     barrage lifted from the front line to our support line and     the SOS went up in the Gavrelle sector and was repeated     almost immediately in the Oppy sector Our SOS was put     down over the whole of the divisional front at the same     timeAs may be imagined the effect of this bombardment was terrible Thebulk of the forward posts were obliterated But even suchconcentration as the Germans directed against the front line was notsufficient to destroy all lifeit could not deal with the whole ofthe line Towy Post and Wood Post had during the last few days beensubjected to a great deal of enemy attention and the posts had beenmovedbut even so the casualties were severe One survivor came outof Mill Post and reported that the trenches had been blotted outand that the entrance to a big dugout there was blown in anddestroyedThe Germans advancing almost shoulder to shoulder entered Gavrellewhich as we know was in a hollow Although there was no living soulthere to oppose them the machine gunners had the place under indirectfire from fourteen guns and the enemy losses were severe But thefirst stages of the battle were centred round Towy and Wood PostsCapt G A N Lowndes of the Queens Westminsters was in command ofTowy Post and with the lifting of the enemy barrage and theappearance of the first Germans there came from the post the cracklingsound of rifle fire joined almost at once by the rattle sound of      228Lewis guns until the whole developed into what might be described asa roar But the enemy was in Gavrelle and the undefended portions ofthe front line on either side of Towy Post Once in the trenches thestorming troops could work slowly forward under some sort of cover Tothe rifle fire of the defenders was soon added the crash of bombs Theenemy was confident he worked slowly and surely round the postThe glorious little band of Queens Westminsters knew what washappening but kept cool Gradually they were forced into a small andcramped area Lewis guns and rifles dealt with Germans in the openclearing the ground round about and forcing the enemy to seek thesafety of the battered trench but the store of bombs was getting lowCapt Lowndes ably supported by 2Lieuts L W Friend and J C BPrice after hanging on to the last moment directed his dwindlingcompany to fight through the Germans in rear using the remainingbombs and swiftly desperately they broke through and reached NavalTrench and joined the rest of the battalion round headquartersBut the Germans coming through Mill Post were already in MarineTrench and LieutCol Glazier commanding the Queens Westminsterspassed a portion of his force into Thames Alley to form a flankNow trouble came from the right The Lancashire Fusiliers of the 4thDivision fell back on to the Ditch Post line and the enemy enteredHumid Trench Col Glazier swung back his right flank into Towy Alleyand held the Germans firmly And then for a moment the fortunes of warturned against the Queens WestminstersThe 56th Divisional Artillery aware that the enemy were in our lines   229attempted to adjust their barrage in consultation with brigadiers Itwas a most difficult task for needless to say communication wasalmost nonexistent At the junction of Naval and Towy Trenches was ablock and in front of it the enemy was held but the artilleryprobably seeing the Germans in Humid and the end of Naval Trenchesput down their barrage too close and blew in our block The Germanhordes quickly took advantage of this bit of luck and swarmed downNaval Trench either killing or capturing the garrison up to theGavrelle roadAbout the same time the block on the left of the line near ThamesValley was forced by the enemy and the whole of the Naval Line wasin his hands But the Queens Westminsters gallantly led by ColGlazier were still in front of the Germans on the line KeillerPelican and Thames Posts Every bit of the communication trencheswhich gave a good fire position every dumphole even the shellholeswere manned and as the Germans advanced over the open inreorganised lines from Naval Trench they were met with a freshrattle and roar of rifle fire The ground was covered with silent andgroaning figures in the fieldgrey uniform and the enemy had toresort once more to bombingAgain the Queens Westminsters gave up a little ground but theenemys effort was smashed At 11 am the position was we held ablock in Towy Alley about 300 yards east of the DitchBailleul Eastline and Castleford Post and the rest of the battalion had joinedthe 2nd London Regt in the BailleulWillerval lineThe account given by the London Rifle Brigade on the left of the         230Queens Westminsters is short but in it one can read the desperatenature of the fighting and the gallant resistance which was put upThe relief of Bradford and Bird Posts was not completed until 330am when the bombardment which heralded the attack commenced Allforward and lateral communication was at once cut Wire and postsdefending the front line were wiped out When the enemy infantryadvanced they simply walked into the front line rushed the few menleft at the blocks in Belvoir and Brough and commenced bombingtowards Naval Trench The battalion was almost annihilated and whatwas left joined the Queens Westminsters in Thames Valley and becamemixed up with them The fighting strength of this battalion at thecommencement of the battle was 23 officers and 564 other ranks it wasreduced to 8 officers and about 60 other ranksThe whole of the 169th Brigade now stood on the BailleulWillervalline and the enemy was held Twice he attacked over the open withaeroplanes flying low and pouring a hail of bullets on the defenderswhile field guns were dragged by plunging horses and straining menacross No Mans Land as far as Naval Trench but each time he wasdefeated The field guns fired no more than twenty rounds before beingsilenced by the 56th Divisional Artillery and though the enemyinfantry had a novel method of advancingthey stood up threw theirrifles forward into a shellhole held up their hands and advancedonly to drop by the side of their arms which they immediatelyproceeded to usethey made no further progressThe right of the 56th Division was at 11 am in touch with the 4th    231Division A battalion of the 167th Brigade was placed under the ordersof the 169th and six machine guns were sent up to Point du Jour andtwo field companies of the Engineers to Tongue and Blanch Posts sothat the right flank of the division seemed secureThe 4th Londons on the right of the 168th Brigade put up a mostgallant defence Wood Post held by 2 officers and 45 other ranks hadbeen moved before the bombardment and so was untouched The fullgarrison was there to meet the enemy who advanced in a solid line onthe left of the wood but came through the wood in groups of about tenmen each 40 yards or so apart and followed by further groups ofabout thirty men each some 200 yards in rearThe enemy was completely checked in the wood and on the left butBeatty Post on the right which had been badly battered about bytrench mortars was occupied The garrison consisting at first of 3officers and 84 other ranks though much depleted when the assault waslaunched was overwhelmed by sheer numbers and only 1 officer and 6men ever returned The enemy then started to work round to the rear ofWood Post but for over an hour this hard little band held out andrepulsed the enemyOppy Post was also smothered by artillery and trench mortars andeventually overwhelmed by the storming infantry Of the 2 officers and48 other ranks forming the garrison 1 officer and 5 other ranks wereleftFifteen minutes after the assault was launched the enemy was in theEarl Lane and Viscount Street but were held for a time by the troopsin Ouse Alley But so long as Wood Post held the enemy did not make     232any great progressMajor F A Phillips was in command of the forward fighting and movedabout encouraging his men who were inflicting heavy casualties on theenemy whenever an attempt was made to advance over the open But WoodPost fell back just before 9 oclock and soon after the enemy beganto force their way up Ouse Alley from Viscount Street in rear of thetroops who were fighting so successfully in Marquis Trench MajorPhillips promptly attacked over the open with about twenty detailsfrom headquarters and drove them backThe enemy had built up heavy rifle fire from Oppy Wood although hewas suffering severely there from our artillery fire and attacked theleft of the battalion many times over the open but the Marquis lineheld and at 11 oclock the position was extraordinary The 169thBrigade on the right was back in the BailleulWillerval line andwhile the advance companies of the 4th London were still holding theMarquis line the enemy was in Ouse Alley and bombing his way towardsthe Bailleul line also he was advancing over the open south of OuseAlley The position then was very precarious and the reserve companywhich Colonel Marchment had sent to get in touch with the forwardtroops and form a flank was unable to reach the forward troops MajorPhillips decided to withdrawThe withdrawal was witnessed by Colonel Marchment from hisheadquarters     I watched it through my glasses It was carried out in a     very steady and orderly way the men leaving in groups of           233     about a dozen Although exposed to a heavy fire from front     and flanks they made excellent use of the ground and     suffered very few casualties The men of the reserve     company met the survivors returning and covered their     retirementThe Kensingtons on the left of the division were not attacked Somefifty of the enemy approached Tommy Post but were at once driven offwith casualties But the battalion gave invaluable aid to the 4thLondons on the right inflicting heavy losses by Lewis gun rifleand rifle grenade fire on the German support troops as they came up tothe wood About 1130 am the battalion was ordered to retire inconjunction with the right of the 3rd Canadian Division on the leftand so came into line with the rest of the divisionThe intense anxiety at Brigade and Divisional Headquarters can best beimagined For the first two hours of the battle little news could begained from Battalion Headquarters as to the progress of the fightThe whole battlefield was enveloped in smoke and interest was chieflycentred on the fine stand which was being made by the QueensWestminsters at Towy Post where a power buzzer was installed andmessages were received from the signallers even after the capture ofthe post At one time while the 4th Londons were still holding thefrontline system the enemy was attacking Bailleul East Post held bythe London Scottish and had captured two machine guns with crews justin front of the post A welltimed counterattack from this gallantregiment drove the enemy back and released the guns and crewsAs the smoke cleared from the field the Divisional Artillery took       234every advantage of their wellsituated observation posts But thoughthe struggle was going on before them observers found that both sideswere frequently so mixed up that they could give no help Small bodiesof our infantry could be seen clearly fighting with Germans on allsides of themOn the right the situation of the 4th Division was very obscure Thedivision was reported to have lost touch with its own brigades whilethe lateral line between the 169th and 12th Brigades was also cutWith the withdrawal of the 56th Division to the BailleulWillervalline the situation cleared They were then in touch with the 4thDivision and the artillery was able to put down a protective barragein front of this line The 3rd Canadian Division gave valuableassistance with nine 18pounders  [Illustration 8 THE FIRST BATTLE OF ARRAS 1918]     From this time till about 3 pm writes BrigGen     Elkington many excellent targets in the open were engaged     by both field and heavy artillery with great effect     Unfortunately owing to the limited number of guns     available and that many had to be used for the immediate     protection of our infantry only a few could be used for the     excellent targets in the open At about 330 pm the enemy     made a heavy attack against the Bailleul line particularly     on Bailleul East Post this was completely shattered by a     concentrated barrage and by rifle and machinegun fire With     the exception of hostile bombing attacks up the     communication trenches leading to the Bailleul line the     enemy made no further serious effort to attack All battery     positions were heavily shelled throughout the day by all     calibres of ordnance the shelling being more of the nature         235     of area shoots than definite counterbattery work As a     result from dawn on the 28th to dawn on the 29th twelve     18pounders were destroyed or put out of action by enemy     shellfire In addition two 18pounders in position as an     enfilade section near Arleux facing southeast had to be     destroyed and abandoned when our line was withdrawn to the     Bailleul line This section engaged many targets with     observation from the vicinity of the guns and was fought     until our infantry withdrew through it The detachments then     retired after damaging the guns burning the dugouts and     removing dial sights and breach blocks All the six 6inch     mortars in the front line were lost to the enemy and no     news was available as to the fate of the officers and     detachments of the two that were manned they were     afterwards found to have been made prisoners During the     night of the 28th29th with the exception of two batteries     all the Divisional Artillery was withdrawn to positions at     an average of about 3600 yards to our new front this move     being carried out by single batteries in turns The     ammunition expended from the early morning of the 28th to     the early morning of the 29th by the 56th Divisional     Artillery alone was 23000 rounds of 18pounder and 8000     rounds of 45 howitzer As a result of an urgent request     to the Corps on the afternoon of the 28th for new guns to     replace the damaged ones six new ones were sent upthese     turned out to be 15pounders for which we had no     ammunition The Germans in their official communiqu     reported that the 56th Division had been annihilatedThe German attack was definitely crushed in the morning but duringthe afternoon a number of halfhearted and tentative attacks weremade The situation however became more quiet about 6 pm and the    236169th Brigade was relieved by the 167th with the 5th Canadian MountedRifles in support at Point du JourDuring the night the engineers were employed in blocking andfillingin the communication trenches in front of the new line andpatrolling was actively carried out The Kensingtons penetrated intoArleux Loop South Kent Road and the junction of Tommy and Baronwhich seems to show that the enemy were dazedOn the 29th except for some demonstrations at the bombing blocks theenemy made no move There were many reports that he was massing forfurther attacks but it became evident that he was relieving hisstorming troops As night fell the first platoons of the 4th CanadianDivision started to relieve and during the night the 167th Brigademoved back to Villers au Bois the 168th to Mont St Eloi and the169th to EcoivresOn the 30th General Dudgeon visited the First Army Headquarters wherehe was congratulated by His Majesty the KingThere is little doubt that the enemy hoped to achieve great results bythis new stroke and that its failure was a serious setback Fivedivisions attacked the 4th and 56th Divisions north of the Scarpe andaccording to captured documents when the line VimyBailleulStLaurentBlangy had been won three special divisions were to attackand capture the Vimy Ridge on the following day South of the Scarpeeleven divisions were launched with the object of capturing Arras andcarrying the attack as far south as Bucquoy The German official listpublished 1919 gives eleven divisions attacking north and south of     237the Scarpe one division at Neuville Vitasse and one atMoyennevillethirteen in all It makes no mention of an attack southof Moyenneville But the eleven which attacked on the Scarpe werebeaten by the four British divisions which held that linethe 4th and56th on the north and the 3rd and 15th on the southFrom this date onward the great German offensive began to decline andended in the Somme area with a final effort to separate the French andBritish Armies on the 4th and 5th April by an attack on the north andsouth of the Somme It was an established fact says Ludendorffthat the enemys resistance was beyond our strength Strategicallythe Germans had not won what the events of the 23rd 24th and 25thMarch had led them to hope forthe failure to take Amiens was a greatdisappointmentThe total casualties of the division were 55 officers and 1433 otherranksnot excessive considering the weight of the attack and theimmortal triumph gained by the 56th Division The importance of thisbattle is so great that we give the comments of the two brigadiersBrigGen Coke says that during the six weeks his brigade had been inthe line the Cheshire Regt had worked splendidly and had put updouble apron belts of wire where they would be most effectivetheNavalMarine line was protected by five belts of wireand this stoodthe bombardment well enough to be a serious obstacle When the smokewhich had enveloped the field at the commencement of the battle hadcleared excellent observation was obtainable and the divisionalobservers and artillery observers did splendid work The enemy           238batteries which came into action in the open during the afternoonwere brought up under cover of smoke and started to fire pointblankat the Bailleul line but the Divisional Artillery silenced them in afew minutes There was no shortage of ammunition or bombs The systemof keeping a plentiful supply in deep dugouts proved sound     All concerned are convinced that the enemy losses were     extremely heavy in front of this brigade The fullest use     was made of Lewis guns and rifles and every attempt of the     enemy to advance on the Bailleul line over the open was     checked by these means The firebays constructed along Towy     Alley proved specially valuable and very considerable     losses were inflicted on the enemy from them during our     withdrawal to the Bailleul line     Many officers testify to the gallant way in which the     Machine Gun Battalion served its guns to the last and to the     good results of the machinegun fire     Our artillery inflicted the maximum amount of damage     possible The number of guns available for the brigade     section was quite inadequate to cover effectively such a     wide front But the infantry testify to the heavy losses     inflicted on the enemy owing to the quick way in which the     group and battery commanders engaged each good target as     soon as it was observed     Gallant work was done by the 169th Light Trench Mortar     Battery during the day Three of the teams disappeared with     the garrisons in the left sector During the withdrawal     mortars were placed to cover Pelican and Bailleul PostsIt was widely noticed by the men of this brigade that the enemyapproached in a slow dazed manner The brigadier thinks that this mayhave been due to the great weight carried by the German infantry who    239seem amongst other things to have carried a weeks rations Theenemy advanced in three or four lines and almost shoulder to shoulderBrigGen Loch sent in a frank and interesting paper in which hepoints out     a The uselessness of locking up large garrisons in the     frontline posts which are clearly known to the enemy and     are within effective trenchmortar range Frontline posts     should be held lightly and be used as observation posts and     to keep the enemy patrols from approaching our main line of     defence They should be carefully concealed need have no     regular communication trenches and should be frequently     changed The garrisons should be small and frequently     relieved If rushed and captured from time to time little     harm is done provided the garrison have no identification     marks Deep dugouts in such posts are a positive danger and     should not be allowed shelters against the weather are     ample If heavily attacked the rle of such posts should be     to put up the SOS and withdraw The sole exception to     this rle is in the case of posts whose whereabouts can be     properly hidden from the enemy Such posts can be strongly     garrisoned and may have machine guns as they will have to     break up and delay an attack The losses in the forward     posts are sufficient commentary on the unsoundness of the     present system     b The value of changing the actual position of the     garrison in any postvide Wood Post     c The grave danger of altering carefully thoughtout     dispositions at the eleventh hour On the evening of the     27th inst my dispositions which had been most minutely     worked out to meet the situation of an attack on my right     flank at the junction with the left of the 169th Brigade     about Viscount Street and covering Bradford and Mill Posts        240     had to be changed as the result of orders and consequently     this portion of the line always weak was rendered     hopelessly incapable of withstanding a strong attack It is     recognised that larger questions were involved and no doubt     decided the redistribution which was not complete before     the attack developed     d The uselessness of Stokes mortars in the actual front     line Such weapons can only open on their SOS lines and     are very vulnerable from attacks on the flanks The four     forward guns only fired about 50 rounds before being     surrounded Had they been behind the main defensive line     covering the communication trenches and themselves covered     by the infantry they would have been far more valuable and     would not possibly have been overrun     e The value of trench blocks was fully found out Such     blocks should be prepared ready against penetration     laterally so as to localise it     h Previous rehearsals and thorough knowledge of overland     routes are essential To the fact that these points had     received proper attention is attributable the successful     delaying action of this brigade     i Defensive flanks prepared as such are invaluable     j Infantry and machine guns must establish closer     liaison It should be recognised once and for all that     all machine guns in a brigade sector must come under the     senior machinegun officer in that sector Nothing herein     said however should be permitted to detract from the     principle that the battalion commander can and should issue     orders to the guns covering him if he considers the     situation demands it     k Main forward communication trenches should never be     traced to lead into strong points Such communication     trenches are mere covering approaches to these strong points     and afford easy access to the enemy Our main battle zone           241     should not be covered by a single trench eg the Red Line     Bailleul but should consist of at least three trenches     with strong points so constructed as not to be apparent and     obvious As with garrisons of forward posts so with     garrisons of battle trenches they should be constantly     moved so as to avoid giving away the position actually heldA captured German officer of the 152nd IR 41st Division gave asthe main causes of the failure of the attack a the intensity ofthe machinegun barrage which caused heavy casualties His regimentlost 12 officers and the 16th IR lost 24 officers b watches didnot appear to have been correctly synchronised We have mentioned theservice rendered by the Machine Gun Battalion but unfortunatelythere is no record of LieutCol E C S Jervis dispositions Thisgallant and able officer says that the tender spots in his defencewere the low ridges running due east and west through Bradford Postand from Mill Post south of Belvoir Alley and then west The formercould not be covered by machinegun fire the latter was And we knowthat the enemy having exterminated the garrison were mown down inand round Gavrelle from the indirect fire of fourteen machinegunsApart from the heavy artillery fire which in itself caused heavycasualties Colonel Jervis points out an interesting feature in thisbattle the complete mastery of the air which the enemy had throughoutthe day resulting in machineguns being spotted and engaged bylowflying aeroplanes which also directed the fire of speciallydetailed heavy artillery Needless to say machineguns are veryvulnerable to this form of attack and we must also point out having    242mentioned the capture of guns that when once the enemy has penetratedthe trench system machinegunners have great difficulty in dealingwith bombing attacks from the flanks The Machine Gun Battalionhowever had a great opportunity in this battle and took fulladvantage of itBrigGen Elkington expresses the opinion that this was the bestaction fought by the 56th Division We do not go quite so far as thisIt was more satisfactory to the troops no doubt but there is a greatdifference between defence and attack A successful defence is morecheering to the infantry and artillery inasmuch as they can moreeasily estimate the damage they do to the enemy but it would not befair to say that this was better than the hard fighting at Gommecourtand south of Arras in April 1917 or indeed on the Somme in 1916 andYpres in 1917 The fact remains however that the 56th Division hadby its stout defence twice saved the situation which had beenimperilled by enemy successes elsewhere                            CHAPTER VIII                                 243                       THE ADVANCE TO VICTORY          BATTLE OF ALBERT 1918BATTLE OF THE SCARPE 1918It must not be thought that this first great German effort ended likeAct I at a theatre with a curtain dropping for fifteen minutes whilethe actors rested and changed their clothes and the spectators foundsolace in nicotine or alcoholTroops in line though they were not being attacked probably workedharder than ever before and the nervous tension was as great as everAll were conscious that the Germans might erupt again and as isusual in such times of stress the weakhearted were always ready toendow the enemy with miraculous powers of assembling of coveringhimself with a cloak of invisibility The rush had been stopped butonly by the sacrifice of a very considerable area of ground and atthe expense of many reserves but a mass of enemy divisions was stillconcentrated on the SommeIt was certain that the enemy would attack again and it seemedprobable that it would be about the centre of the British line wherehis preparations were already complete Indeed the situation was moreserious than it had ever beenThe British Army had used up all its reserves in the fighting on the     244Somme and in addition ten divisions had been withdrawn from the northand replaced with wornout divisions reinforced from England Thereasons for draining the north are given by Sir Douglas Haig as beingthat he could under urgent necessity give ground there to a limitedextent but a breakthrough in the centre about Vimy would mean therealisation of the enemys plans which had been foiled by our defenceof Arras on the 28th March namely the capture of Amiens and theseparation of the bulk of the British Armies from the French and fromthose British forces acting under the direction of the latterTherefore in view of the preparations which had been made on thatsector by the enemy British forces could not be reducedCertain preparations for an attack north of the La Basse Canal hadbeen observed prior to the 21st March and there were indications thatthe enemy was completing these early in April but the extent andforce of the possible attack could not be gaugedOn the 7th April a heavy and prolonged bombardment with gas shell wasopened by the Germans from Lens to Armentires And at 4 oclock inthe morning of the 9th the bombardment was reopened with the greatestintensity At 7 oclock again helped by a thick fog the enemyattacked the left brigade of the Portuguese 2nd Division and brokeinto their trenches a few minutes later the attack spread to thenorth and south The attack included the left of the First Army andthe right of the Second ArmyThis great thrust in the direction of Hazebrouck was brought to astandstill between Merville and the Fort de Nieppe but the enemypenetrated beyond Bailleul and in the north took Kemmel Hill and        245forced a retirement from the Passchendaele RidgeThis brings the general situation up to the end of April But we mustnote that on the 14th Marshal Foch became the Allied GeneralissimoThe next German move was on the 27th May northwest of Rheims on theAisne front The 19th 21st 25th and 50th British Divisions whichhad taken part in both the Somme and the Lys Valley fighting had beensent down to a quiet part of the French front they were joined by the8th Division which had been in some of the hardest fighting on theSomme These divisions constituted the IX Corps and were included inthe Sixth French Army The German attack fell on the IX Corps and theFrench Corps on their left which was holding the Chemin des Damesthey were forced from their positions and by the 30th May the enemyhad reached the Marne The attacks continued until the 6th June whenthey culminated in two attempts on the Montagne de Bligny but herethey were heldBy this time the Allied reserves were being used wherever they werewanted But it had been for the most part French reserves which hadcome to the aid of the British At the beginning of July howeverMarshal Foch believed that the enemy was about to attack east and westof Rheims and he moved the whole of his French troops eightdivisions from Flanders and in addition asked for four Britishdivisions to relieve French troops on the Somme A further fourdivisions were also sent down as a reserve behind the French frontAs the Marshal had foreseen the enemy attacked on the 15th July andafter making progress and crossing the Marne was held by French        246American and Italian divisionsOn the 18th July the Marshal launched his great counteroffensive onthe Chteau ThierrySoissons front and in this used the four Britishdivisions he had held in reserve and which constituted the XXIICorps The 56th Division entered this Corps later onIn view of the defeats inflicted up to the moment of thecounteroffensive it might well be supposed that the troops of theEntente were despondent The Germans were surprised at M Clemenceaustating that he would fight before Paris that he would fight inParis and that he would fight behind Paris and this same spiritcertainly pervaded the 56th Division With these great enemy successesthroughout the months of March April May and July in mind theactions of the 56th Division during those months are perhaps the mostsignificant and in our opinion the most gallant work they performedThere was no set battle And a set battle is in some ways the easiestkind of attack for the infantry The operations through those monthswere of a minor character calling for a high level of courage anddetermination from small parties of men parties so small that thesuccess of the enterprise must depend on individual gallantry asthere was no mass to drag them along At any time minor operationsdeserve more praise than is allotted to them and at this time in theface of a series of German victories they are worthy of the highestadmirationDivisional Headquarters were at a place called Acq to the northwestof Arras and the brigades in the neighbouring villages Again thedivision was not to know a lengthy period of rest for on the 8th        247April the 56th Division had relieved the 1st Canadian Division andGen Dudgeon took over command of the line During the week ofsocalled rest brigades were called upon to provide anything between1200 and 1500 men each night for fatigues digging further lines ofdefence Bow Bells were active and those who were not on fatiguejoined in many a chorus with a flavour and memory of London TownThe new front was south of the Scarpe and the ArrasDouai railwayground over which the division had fought in the same month of theprevious year The high ground of Monchy and Orange Hill on this sideof the Scarpe had been lost on the 28th and the line now ran throughFampoux on the north of the river in front of Feuchy to Bois desBufs to the east of Tilloy and so to Neuville Vitasse Bois desBufs was about the centre of the line held by the division which wasthus astride of the ArrasCambrai road The Corps was the XVIIFergusson and had been part of the Third Army but on the 8th itwas transferred to the First ArmyFrom the moment of taking over the line patrols were pursuing anaggressive policy Many small encounters took place in No Mans Landthe 56th Division gradually gaining the ascendancy over the enemyOn the 19th at 430 am the 168th Brigade carried out a mostsuccessful enterprise The idea was to advance the outpost line on theTilloyWancourt road and was undertaken by the London Scottish on theright with one company and a bombing section and the 4th LondonRegt on the left with one platoon and two bombing sections The enemy  248were taken completely by surprise One warrant officer and three otherranks were captured together with nine machine guns and aGrenatenwerfer The enemy line was held throughout the day but thehostile artillery fire became stronger the position was notparticularly good and towards the evening orders were given toevacuate it While this was being done at dusk the Germans launched acounterattack and a lively scuffle ensued The enemy was first beatenoff and then the retirement was effectedA curious incident occurred during this brush with the enemy TheGermans as usual sent up a multitude of lights and a combination ofthese appear to have presented to the artillery observers a cluster oflights such as our SOS rocket contained at that moment The SOSbarrage was accordingly put down much to the surprise of the LondonScottishThe prisoners were of the 65th Infantry Regt 185th DivisionOn the 23rd April the 56th Division took over from the 15th Divisionthe sector north of the ArrasCambrai road and held the whole of theXVII Corps frontThe enemy raided on the 24th and occupied for a short period agunpit post He was ejected and gained no identification but two ofhis dead were found and proved to be of the 28th Infantry Regt 185thDivision But the next night two prisoners were captured by a patrolon the extreme left of the line near Broken Mill belonging to the14th Bavarian Regt 16th Bavarian Division which indicated a reliefof the 185th DivisionGen Dudgeon who had led the division through some very heavy           249fighting fell ill on the 25th and was sent to hospital His recordwith the division is a fine one At the third battle of Ypres he hadscarcely time to look round knew no one in the division and hisposition might be described as most unenviable at the battle ofCambrai he was called upon to carry out a most difficult task atArras he went through a most anxious and trying period At none ofthese places did he falter The ordeals which were thrust upon himwere heavy but he brought the division through them triumphantlyBrigGen Freeth assumed temporary command of the division untilGen Hull arrived on the 4th MayNo man had such power over the 56th Division as Gen Hull Thewonderful pugnacious spirit they had shown in the LaventieRichebourgline was roused to its highest pitch when after a quiet ten daysstudy of the line the General ordered a whole series of raids whichat last caused the Germans to erect a board in their line on whichwas chalked Please dont raid us any moreOn the 21st May the 8th Middlesex raided near the TilloyWancourt roadand captured four prisoners and a machine gun They established theimportant fact that the 16th Bavarian Division had been relieved bythe 214th the prisoners being of the 50th RegtOn the 27th patrols ran into strong parties of the enemy covering alarge number of men engaged in wiring the enemy front The next nighta somewhat ambitious raid was made on a wide front of either side ofthe TilloyWancourt road On the left was the 7th Middlesex in three    250parties one company in all on the right two platoons of the 1stLondon RegtThe raid was a great success Under an excellent barrage of whicheveryone spoke with the highest praise the raiders entered the enemylines They found it packed with men north of the road The 1stLondons claimed to have killed 40 south of the road and the 7thMiddlesex appear to have spread terror and devastation in their areaThe right party of Middlesex estimated that they had killed 32 of theenemy and captured 1 machine gun The centre party first met the enemyin shellholes outside their wire and quickly disposed of them theyclaimed 35 Germans killed 1 prisoner and 1 machine gun The leftparty counted the damage they inflicted as no less than 60 killed Theartillery had also done fearful execution Although many of the enemywere seen running away the total casualties inflicted by this raidwere reckoned to be 200 Making every allowance for exaggerationforit is extremely difficult to count dead men during a raidthe factsremain that the raid was a huge success and the casualties inflictedexceedingly heavyNo attempt was made to advance our outpost line and our wounded weretaken safely back The total casualties of the raiding parties were 2officers killed and 2 wounded 2 other ranks killed and 49woundedthe wounds were mostly slight The identification procuredwas normal50th Regt 214th DivisionOn the 30th May the Kensingtons sent out an enterprising patrol whichrushed an enemy post and captured two more prisoners IdentificationnormalThe month of June opened with a raid by the Kensingtons near the         251Cambrai road Many of the enemy were killed and 27 taken prisonersThe Germans did not show much fight on this occasion but in mostcases emerged from dugouts with no rifles or equipment They wereagain of the 50th Infantry Regt 214th Division The Kensingtonscasualties were 1 killed and 17 woundedOn the 10th June the 7th Middlesex raided on the left of the linenear Broken Mill and secured two prisoners of the 358th InfantryRegt 214th DivisionOne company of the London Rifle Brigade suddenly raided at 3 oclockin the afternoon on the 12th June south of the Cambrai road Theyadvanced under cover of smoke and killed about 24 of the enemy andcaptured 1 machine gun Their casualties were only 3 killed and 11wounded in spite of their daring Identification normalSoon after this raid the Germans were seen to be active in theirlines Many officers were noticed examining our lines on the 24thJune and the next night a platoon of the 1st Londons and a platoon ofthe 8th Middlesex entered the enemy lines on the left and inflictedcasualties but failed to obtain identification This was soonsecured however by the London Rifle Brigade who brought in a man ofthe 50th Infantry Regt on the 3rd JulyThe Queens Westminsters sent a company over into some fortifiedgunpits on the 8th July and secured three prisoners of the 358thRegiment 214th Division They took over with them some heavy chargesof ammonal as it was known that a deep dugout existed As soon asthe raiders reached the gunpits the garrison led by an officerattempted to come out of the dugout The officer was promptly shot     252though he missed the leading man of the Queens Westminsters by ahairsbreadth and a charge of the explosive was thrown down thedugout A terrific explosion completely destroyed that entrance Theraiders then found the second entrance and treated it in the samefashion The prisoners stated that between fifty and sixty men were inthe dugout with two officersThis ended the series of raids and it would seem as though the 185thand 214th German Divisions had good cause to remember the 56thDivision But it is an exceedingly fine record and speaks highly ofthe moral of the London men and the inspiring leadership oftheir GeneralGen Hull handed over to the 2nd Canadian Division on the 15th Julyand the division moved through Roellecourt to Villers ChtelBefore leaving this period we must quote from BrigGen Elkingtonsdiary     In addition to the 56th Divisional Artillery I had several     other RA brigades under my command to assist in covering     the front namely the 29th 277th and 311th RA Brigades     During April and May Gen Dudgeon suffered from severe     rheumatism and had to give up command of the division     MajorGen Hull returned and took over command     Reconnaissances and selection of several back lines in case     of withdrawal being necessary on this front were carried     out and all battery positions carefully marked and their     observation posts selected also their lines of retreat if     necessary Continual training in moving warfare was also     carried out by means of skeleton drill with full staff A     polo ground was used near Dainville and play went on twice a     week until the enemy elected to shell the ground when it     had to be stopped During this period the artillery                 253     supported many successful raids by our infantry and the     Canadians on our right The Bow Bells established     themselves in a hut near our headquarters and gave many     excellent shows to crowded houses Towards the end of May     Indian drivers were sent to us from the Divisional     Ammunition Column to release the European personnel These     drivers did very well after they had been trained but     suffered rather from the cold during the winter On the 15th     July the 56th Divisional Infantry was relieved by the 2nd     Canadian Division and I remained in the line commanding the     RA until the 21st July when we were relievedRefitting and training were carried out and after two weeks in theback area which was not free from enemy attention in the nature ofaeroplane bombs the division started on the 31st July to relieveportions of the 1st Canadian Division in the Tilloy and Vitassesections of the line The Telegraph Sector was relieved during thenight of the following day and on the 2nd August Gen Hull took overcommand of the lineThe weather generally was very good and the line quiet The 167thBrigade obtained identification on the 4th showing that the 185thGerman Division had been relieved by the 39th Division On the 8th thedivision projected gas on Neuville Vitasse but otherwise everythingwas quietOn the 15th the 167th Brigade was relieved by the 44th Brigade 15thDivision and moved by rail to IzellesHameau area On the 18th the168th Brigade was relieved by the 46th Brigade and moved to Maziresarea And on the 18th the 169th Brigade went to ArrasAt that date there was a proposal that the XVII Corps should attack      254Orange Hill and Chapel Hill and the 56th Division was to take part inthis attack Days however were spent in moving aboutOn the 20th Sir Douglas Haig visited Gen Hull The same day the 169thBrigade moved to AvesneleComte area and the 168th to Lignereuil Atmidday on the 21st the 56th Division was transferred from the XVIICorps to the VI Corps and the whole division moved to the Bavincourtarea when an entirely new scheme of attack came into being                                         In his dispatch covering this period Sir Douglas Haig writes     The definite collapse of the ambitious offensive launched     by the enemy on the 15th July and the striking success of     the Allied counteroffensive south of the Aisne effected a     complete change in the whole military situationThis first big operation of Marshal Foch had inflicted heavy losses onthe enemy Ten divisions were broken up and the remnants used asreinforcements to others The attempt to make the Entente Powers suefor peace before the arrival of the Americans had failednot onlywere a million troops from the United States in France but theEnglish divisions had been largely made up to strength Between Mayand June ten English divisions had been reduced to cadresseven ofthese were reconstituted during July and August And German GeneralHeadquarters had been forced to take momentous decisions They had towithdraw from the salient between Rheims and Soissons and also abandon  255their idea of a new offensive in Flanders By the beginning ofAugust says Ludendorff we had suspended our attack and reverted tothe defensive on the whole frontAt a conference held on the 23rd July it was arranged by MarshalFoch that the British French and American Armies should each prepareplans for a local offensive The objectives on the British front werethe disengagement of Amiens and the freeing of the ParisAmiensrailway by an attack on the AlbertMontdidier front The rle of theFrench and American Armies was to free other strategic railwaysfarther south and eastThere seems a suggestion in his dispatches that the BritishCommanderinChief was somewhat perturbed by this decision He had thesafety of the Channel ports and the danger of a fresh German offensivein that direction ever in his mind and we know that it wasLudendorffs plan There is an indication that Sir Douglas Haig wasurging a counterstroke in the north These different operations hesays had already been the subject of correspondence between MarshalFoch and myself Ultimately he came to the conclusion that the tasksassigned to the British forces east of Amiens should take precedenceas being the most important and the most likely to give largeresultsThe attack opened on the 8th August on a front of over eleven milesfrom just south of the AmiensRoye road to Morlancourt On the rightwas the Canadian Corps in the centre the Australian Corps and on theleft the III Corps The attack of the First French Army was timed totake place an hour later between Moreuil and the British right By the12th August 22000 prisoners and over 400 guns had been captured and    256the line had been advanced to a depth of twelve miles to the oldGerman positions in 1916The 8th August was the black day of the German Army in the history ofthis war says Ludendorff[5]     The Emperor told me later that after the failure of the     July offensive and after the 8th August he knew the war     could no longer be won The official report of the evening     of the 8th announced briefly that the enemy had penetrated     our line south of the Somme on a wide front Early the     following morning General von Cramon rang me up from Baden     He informed me that my report had caused great alarm in     Vienna I could not leave him in any doubt as to the serious     view I took of the situation Nevertheless he begged me to     remember how detrimentally the blunt admission of defeat     must affect our allies who had placed all their hopes in     Germany This occurred again on the 2nd September     The impression made on our Allies by the failure on the     Western Front was great The Emperor Charles announced his     intention of coming to Spa in the middle of AugustThe great salient the Germans had created towards Amiens wasdisappearing and Sir Douglas Haig was faced with the old positions ofthe opening of the battle of the Somme in 1916 But there was adifference The situation and his reasoning are succinctly related inhis dispatch     In deciding to extend the attack northwards to the area            257     between the Rivers Somme and Scarpe I was influenced by the     following considerations     The enemy did not seem prepared to meet an attack in this     direction and owing to the success of the Fourth Army he     occupied a salient the left flank of which was already     threatened from the south A further reason for my decision     was that the ground north of the Ancre River was not greatly     damaged by shellfire and was suitable for the use of     Tanks A successful attack between Albert and Arras in a     southeasterly direction would turn the line of the Somme     south of Pronne and give every promise of producing     farreaching results It would be a step towards the     strategic objective St QuentinCambrai     This attack moreover would be rendered easier by the fact     that we now held the commanding plateau south of Arras about     Bucquoy and Ablainzeville which in the days of the old     Somme fighting had lain well behind the enemys lines In     consequence we were here either astride or to the east of     the intricate system of trench lines which in 1916 we had no     choice but to attack frontally and enjoyed advantages of     observation which at that date had been denied us     It was arranged that on the morning of the 21st August a     limited attack should be launched north of the Ancre to gain     the general line of the ArrasAlbert railway on which it     was correctly assumed that the enemys main line of     resistance was sited The day of the 22nd August would then     be used to get troops and guns into position on this front     and to bring forward the left of the Fourth Army between the     Somme and the Ancre The principal attack would be delivered     on the 23rd August by the Third Army and the divisions of     the Fourth Army north of the Somme the remainder of the     Fourth Army assisting by pushing forward south of the river     to cover the flank of the main operation Thereafter if     success attended our efforts the whole of both armies were         258     to press forward with the greatest vigour and exploit to the     full any advantage we might have gained                                         It will be seen therefore that as the attack from Amiens advancedit was being taken up by troops on the left On the 21st August the IVCorps was engaged with the 42nd New Zealand and 37th Divisions andthe VI Corps with the 2nd and Guards Divisions On the 23rd a seriesof strong assaults were delivered on practically the whole front ofthirtythree miles from our junction with the French at LihonsAs the attack spread to the north so activity in Corps Division andBrigade Headquarters preceded actual movement of troops A state ofbrain and nerve tension prevailed There was too a change of planwhich is always one of the trials of the regimental soldier It is aswell to recapitulate some of the movementsThe relief in the line was completed on the 18th August and on the19th the 169th Brigade was sent to Arras to carry out preparations foran attack on Orange and Chapel Hills Owing to the change of plan thisbrigade was sent back to the AvesnesleComte area on the 21st and onthe same day the 168th Brigade marched from the Mazires area toLignereuil The 56th Division now came under the VI Corps Haldaneand Gen Hull at once visited Corps Headquarters but did not succeedin gaining any exact information as to the rle the division wouldplay in the forthcoming operations During the night 21st22nd thedivision marched to the area BarlySt AmandSaultyBavincourtEarly in the morning of the 22nd Gen Hull was called to a conference    259at Corps Headquarters where the operations for the next day weredecided upon He did not get back to Bavincourt until 1030 am whenhe held a conference and explained the operations to all concernedOfficers of all brigades were then sent off to reconnoitre and the168th Brigade marched at 330 pm to Blairville a distance of sevenand a half milesTime was now getting on and the Corps Operation order had not beenreceived Gen Hull however sent out his orders based on what hadbeen said at the conference in the morning and at 9 pm the 168thBrigade with the 1st London Regt attached moved to the assemblyarea a march of another four and a half miles ready to attack on theleft of the Guards Division In the midst of all this movement andwith only a short time at their disposal officers had no opportunityof seeing the forward assembly areas or the objectives They assembledin the dark and attacked in the morning never having seen the groundbeforeThe artillery was no better off than the infantry     On the 21st August orders were received to join the VI     Corps and I went off to see the Corps RA who were a long     way back and also to see the 40th Division Artillery and     the Guards Artillery and to try to reconnoitre the new     front On the evening of the 21st I received instructions     from the RA VI Corps that all arrangements were at once to     be made to put the 56th Artillery in action to cover the     attack of the 56th Division on the morning of the 23rd the     divisional front being roughly from 500 yards north of     Hamelincourt to just north of Boiry Becquerelle The                260     Divisional Artillery for purposes of the initial attack     consisted of six brigades RFA as follows a Guards     Divisional Artillery b 57th c 56th On the 21st     August these brigades were as follows a in action on     the front b in reserve near St Pol c in reserve     at Simencourt and Berneville Reconnaissance was carried out     during the morning of the 22nd and at 8 pm that evening     the brigades moved off to occupy the positions selected and     ammunition to the extent of 400 rounds per gun had to be     dumped at the same time This involved an immense amount of     work but it was successfully carried out by the brigades of     the 56th Divisional Artillery by 2 am on the 23rd but the     brigades of the 57th Divisional Artillery though all guns     were got into action were delayed by heavy gas shelling     and were as a result unable to complete the gundumps by the     opening of the barrage At this time the artillery covering     the division was organised as follows     Right group          74th and 75th Brigades RFA Guards Divisional          Artillery in action west of BoisleuxauMont     Centre group          285th and 286th Brigades RFA 57th Divisional         Artillery in action southeast of BoisleuxauMont     Left group          280th and 281st Brigades RFA 56th Divisional          Artillery in action southwest of BoisleuxauMont     As far as the field artillery was concerned the strength of     the barrage was about one 18pounder gun per 27 yards     Affiliated Heavy Artillery grouptwo brigades RGA [Gen     Elkington]The position from which the division attacked was a very strong one      261for defence The Cojeul River has two branches The northern branchrunning from the high ground by Adinfer Wood passes to the north ofBoisleuxSt Marc and Boiry Becquerelle The southern branch runningacross the front of the division is underground between Hamelincourtand Boyelles where it comes to the surface and joins the main streamsouth of HeninThe left flank of the division rested on Cojeul north There wastherefore a wide field of vision in front of them with the oneexception of the spur which shoots out between the two branches of theriver to the north of Boyelles and which afforded the enemy aconcealed position on that portion of the front The general run ofthe valley was across the direction of the 56th Division attack andCroisilles and St Leger were over the ridge on the far side of thevalley Beyond these villages the Hindenburg Line ran roughly fromArras in a southeasterly direction obliquely across the line ofattackThe first objective of the 168th Brigade which was to make theattack was the blue linethat is the two villages of Boyelles andBoiry Becquerelle and the brigade would then push out a fringe ofposts in front Twentyone Tanks two companies 11th Battalion TankCorps were to help in this attackAs the battalions of the 168th Brigade marched to their positions theGermans used gas freely and respirators had to be worn Fortunatelythe night was light but even so progress was slow and such light asthere was did not help officers when they had placed their men inposition to see very much of what sort of a place it was they wouldattack in the morning It seemed that the enemy was very alert as he    262fired a great deal with machine guns and light trench mortars duringthe nightAt 455 am in the murky light of dawn the barrage which had openedat 4 am at Gommecourt on the right of the VI Corps crashed down infront of the 56th Division The Kensingtons on the right north ofHamelincourt the 4th Londons in the centre and the London Scottishon the left advanced to the assault twelve minutes later The Tankscleared the way for the Kensingtons very effectively only a few smallparties of the enemy showing much fight The battalion however wasworried by machinegun fire from the left and it was seen that the4th Londons were meeting with more determined opposition Two platoonsof the Kensingtons were therefore sent to assist by attackingBoyelles from the south By 6 oclock the Kensingtons had reachedtheir objectiveThe 4th Londons had the village of Boyelles and the curious circularMarc system in front of them The ruins of the village could be seenfrom the right but Marc system was blind Actually the ground betweenour frontline trench and the enemy line was level but it droppedsuddenly from the German line and was helped by a sunken road so thatthere was plenty of shelter from the barrage The left of the 4thLondons was held up in front of this place For some reason no Tankattacked the forward Marc system and until a platoon enfiladed thesunken road from the south and the London Scottish threatened fromthe north the garrison held up the advance and inflicted heavycasualties When the troops pressed in from the flanks however the     263Germans 2 officers and 80 men surrenderedMuch the same thing happened to the right company of the 4th Londonsin the village of Boyelles But here four Tanks came on the scene andagain the garrison surrendered with eleven machine guns Six lightheavy and medium trench mortars were captured in the banks on thenorth of the streamThe London Scottish on the left met with opposition from BoiryBecquerelle but carried out a smart enveloping movement closing onthe village from the flanks and eventually getting behind it Over100 prisoners and 8 machine guns were taken by this wellknownbattalionAll the first objective was then in our handsAt 915 am the 168th Brigade was ordered to continue the advance soas to conform with the 2nd Guards Brigade on the right The brigadewas to gain touch with the Guards at Bank Copse on the east side ofthe railway curve into St Leger But this order had to be transmittedby runner and distances were great it did not reach the centrebattalion until 1115 amThe Kensingtons started their advance at 130 pm and almost at oncemet with strong machinegun and artillery fire The advance was heldup on the ErvillersBoyelles road and much confused fighting ensuedTwo platoons managed to get round the opposition and joined theGuards with whom they attacked the railway bank to the west of BankCopse The remainder of the battalion was apparently fighting in smallgroups and was much scattered The commanding officer LieutCol RS F Shaw went forward to try to clear up the situation and waskilled by a sniper The position on this battalion front was not         264certain until 930 pm when it was ascertained that they were on theline of the ErvillersBoyelles roadThe 4th Londons did not advance until 430 pm They attacked inwidely extended formation and casualties were very light There wasopposition from five enemy machine guns but these were outflanked andovercome The line of Boyelles Reserve was reached and patrols pushedout 500 yards beyond without encountering any of the enemyThe London Scottish attacked at the same time as the 4th Londons andencountered strong opposition at Boiry Work at the northern end ofBoyelles Reserve For one hour the London Scottish worked slowly toget round this position but before they closed in the garrisonsurrendered86 prisoners They were then in line with the 4th Londonsand their posts pushed out some 500 yards in advanceIn spite of the hurried orders it had been a successful day for the56th Division The Kensingtons had had the worst time but theycaptured in all 167 prisoners while the 4th Londons had 243 and theLondon Scottish 253Commenting on the attack BrigGen Loch says that the chiefdifficulty was the short notice given and the fact that the brigadewas billeted in a much scattered area made the rapid issue of ordersimpossible It was also impossible to reconnoitre the ground and theapproach march was made in exceptionally hot weather There had beenno preparation of the front prior to the attack and signalcommunications were poor Visual signalling was of little value owingto the dust and the heavy state of the atmosphere and reliance had      265to be placed as it invariably was on runners who worked well but asthe distances were ever increasing it was a slow method     The Tanks he says were most valuable although through     various causes they in some cases arrived late in the     assembly areas Their greater speed enabled them to catch up     the infantry and by working forward and then to a flank     they evidently much demoralised the enemy and caused them to     surrender more freely than usualThe machine guns which since the beginning of March had been formedinto a battalion were controlled by LieutCol Jervis who was withthe Brigade Headquarters and were echloned in depth the forwardline advancing with the assaulting infantryThe enemy was in considerable strength as is shown by the number ofprisoners 663 and the 59 machine guns and 18 trench mortars whichwere capturedOther divisions of the VI and IV Corps were equally successful andthe Germans holding the defences to the south about Thiepval whichhad caused us such efforts to win in 1916 were in a precariousposition The attack was pressed without giving the enemybreathingspace and he was becoming disorganised and showing signs ofconfusionBut in writing of this great and last advance we are conscious that adivision which until this moment had always appeared to be a largeand important unit in any operations was being swamped by the numbersset in motion One of five or six is such a much bigger proportionthan one of fiftyseven or fiftyeight And the French American and    266Belgian Armies were moving tooDuring the night the London Scottish were placed under the orders ofthe 167th Brigade which relieved the Kensingtons and 4th LondonRegiment The 169th Brigade moved to the Basseux area and in themorning of the 24th to the Purple Line behind BoisleuxauMontThe 167th Brigade were ordered to attack the next day the 24th withSummit Trench as their first objective refusing their left flank soas to join with the 52nd Division on the northern boundary The secondobjective was Fooley ReserveHill SwitchCross Switch with the objectof enveloping Croisilles from the north while the Guards Divisioncarried out a similar operation from the south Twelve Tanks and onecompany of the Machine Gun Battalion were to assistAt 7 am the barrage opened on the enemy frontline posts and afterten minutes crept forward at the rate of 100 yards in four minutesfollowed by the infantry The whole of the brigade of courseattackedthe 8th Middlesex being on the right the 7th Middlesex inthe centre and the 1st London Regiment on the left The GuardsDivision also attacked on the right and the 52nd on the leftThe 8th Middlesex reached their objective in Summit Trench and LedgerReserve about 10 oclock Opposition was not of a fierce nature andtook the form of patchy machinegun fire and rifle fire Smallparties of men kept working forward and could be seen with Tanks inand about Summit Trench by 830 am The 7th Middlesex and 1st Londonsadvanced in a similar fashion and with the same opposition              267But news came from the Corps which for the moment checked theadvance From prisoners statements it was learned that three freshdivisions had arrived in Bullecourt and Hendicourt and the 56thDivision was ordered to make preparations to meet a counterattackThe 169th Brigade was ordered forward behind Boyelles and the 167thBrigade was told to occupy Croisilles by peaceful penetrationMeanwhile the right brigade of the 52nd Division which was attackingHenin Hill had been compelled to withdraw and was echloned on theforward slopes to the left rear of the 56th DivisionPatrols began to probe the country before them and at 130 pm thesituation was the 8th Middlesex had one company on the western sideof Croisilles with patrols on the outskirts of the village twocompanies in Summit Trench and that end of Leger Reserve and onecompany in Boyelles Reserve The 7th Middlesex had two companies inSummit Trench with patrols in front and support and reservecompanies in depth in rear The 1st Londons had two companies inSummit Trench in touch with the 52nd Division and support andreserve companies in rearReports tended to show that Croisilles had been evacuated and after aconsultation with BrigGen Freeth Gen Hull ordered the Brigade toattack and establish itself in the Hindenburg Support Line betweenHump Lane and River Road Sense River Six Tanks were to be usedand the 52nd Division was to attack on the leftAttempts made by the 8th Middlesex to enter Croisilles were not          268successful and at zero hour 730 pm the village was still in thehands of the enemyThe attack was met with determined and very heavy machinegun andartillery fire and failed to gain any ground Only one Tank came intoaction and that was met with gas which rendered it uselessCroisilles Trench had been reached by troops but found to be only 2feet deep at the most and quite useless as a reorganising point forfurther advance This trench had unfortunately been shown as anorganised and deep defensive work BrigGen Freeth thereforeordered Summit Trench to be held as the line of resistanceThe days fighting had resulted in an appreciable gain but theenemys resistance was increasing The Corps ordered an attack on theHindenburg Support the following day without the help of Tanks andGen Hull had to point out that the resistance was not only verystrong as he had proved that day but that the Hindenburg system wasvery heavily wired Tanks would have dealt with this wire had theybeen available The Corps then modified the order and instructed theGeneral to capture Croisilles and obtain a footing in Sense Avenueto the northeast so as to conform with the 52nd Division who wereto attack on the leftDuring the night the frontline battalions were heavily shelled withgas which forced them to wear gasmasks in one case for six hoursPatrols however went out and their reports coincided with that ofthe Guards Division on the right that Croisilles was full of machineguns Also the 52nd Division on the left reported that the Hindenburg    269Line was very strongly held It was decided to bombard the villagewhile patrols would try to gain groundBut the 25th August was a negative day Some posts were established infront of the main line but the village itself was too strongly heldand the bombardment apparently failed to dislodge the enemyMeanwhile the 169th Brigade reconnoitred the position with a view ofattacking and enveloping Croisilles from the north and capturing theHindenburg LineAt 8 am the 56th and 52nd Divisions had been moved from the commandof the VI Corps to that of the XVII Corps and it was decided that the167th Brigade should attack on the 26th and establish itself on theline of the shallow Croisilles Trench and Fooley Reserve Roughly theXVII Corps faced the Hindenburg Line which swung round the left flankof the 56th Division and on this flank the 52nd Division were toadvance on the Hindenburg Line in conjunction with the attack of the167th Brigade Farther north the Canadian Corps were to assault theactual Hindenburg Line and if they were successful the 52nd Divisionwould continue to push down the system and roll it up in asoutheasterly directionThe attack of the 167th Brigade took place at 3 am and was nowheresuccessful The wire was still uncut there were in some spots fivebelts of it and the machine guns in Croisilles poured a devastatinghail of bullets on the assaulting troops But to the north theCanadian Corps had been successful and had pierced the Hindenburg        270system The 52nd Division had thrust one battalion into the celebratedline and was progressing towards Henin HillDuring the afternoon the 52nd Division reported the line from theCojeul River to Henin Hill clear of the enemy and the 167th Brigadewas then relieved at 6 oclock by the 169thThe battalions in line from the right were the Queens Westminstersthe London Rifle Brigade and the 2nd Londons On taking over the 2ndLondons attempted to clear the situation on the left by a stealthraid with two platoons The experiment was bad as the platoons werealmost wiped out by machine gunsThe battle was continued the following day the 27th at 930 am Thetask was to keep in touch with the 52nd Division and sweep round thenorth of the village The Queens Westminsters therefore stood fastwhile the London Rifle Brigade and the 2nd Londons executed a wheel tothe right This was successful in reaching Farmers Avenue and SenseAvenue while on the left the 52nd Division reached FontaineCroisilles and established themselves to the east of that village Aglance at the map will show how the Hindenburg Line was being rolledup how desperate was the case of the Germans opposite the 56thDivision and how necessary it was for them to concentrate theirfiercest resistance against the advance of the 56th Division The daywas noteworthy for the good work done by the 2nd Londons in what wasthe nearest approach to open warfare which had as yet been attemptedCroisilles was the obstacle which stood in our way The GuardsDivision attacked on the right of it and after an initial success was   271counterattacked so severely that they fell back on Leger Reserve andleft a gap on the right of the Queens Westminsters which was filledby two platoons of the latter regiment Farther to the south troopswere fighting on the Somme battlefield of the month of September1916still some way from the Hindenburg Line But as has beenpointed out the whole of the old Somme positions were being turnedfrom the northDuring the afternoon the 168th Brigade took over the frontage held bythe right and centre battalions of the 169th Brigade These twobattalions were then able to enter the Hindenburg system which hadbeen captured by the 52nd Division and move along it towards theSense River where they would start the attack The 2nd Londonsmeanwhile cleared their front of some small parties of the enemy andcrossed the Sense to Nelly Avenue part of an outpost line to themain defences The division then stood fast under orders to attack theBullecourt area the next dayDuring the night dispositions were altered The 167th Brigade tookover the right of the Divisional front with the 8th Middlesex to thewest of Croisilles and the 168th Brigade moved in position to supportthe 169th in the attack along the Hindenburg Line Also the 168thBrigade was to protect the flank of the 169th if the village was nottaken and mop up generally behind the attacking troopsThe first objective for the 169th Brigade was given as QueensLaneJove Lane the second was the trenches southeast of BullecourtPatrols of the 8th Middlesex attempted to enter Croisilles severaltimes during the night but were always met with machinegun fire In    272the morning of the 28th however an aeroplane reported the villageempty but at 830 am patrols of the 8th Middlesex found only thewestern portion of the village clear The whole battalion thenadvanced and after some lively fighting occupied the villageThe 52nd Division which had been relieved by the 57th Divisionpassed through the troops in the line and joined in the general attackof the 56th Division at 1230 pm The action that followed is one ofthe utmost confusion The Queens Westminsters who led the attackstarted from the line Nelly Avenue The Germans on the right inGuardian Reserve held out and the 167th Brigade found sufficient ofthe enemy to hold them up on the railway southeast of Croisilles Buttwo companies of the Queens Westminsters and part of the 2nd Londonslost direction and seem to have become inextricably mixed with troopsof the 57th Division somewhere to the north of HendicourtApparently trouble started on the previous day 27th when theQueens Westminsters and part of the London Rifle Brigade wererelieved by the London Scottish in front of Croisilles The two formerbattalions had to march to a flank to get into the Hindenburg Lineand were severely shelled in doing so On arriving at the HindenburgLine progress to their positions of assembly was seriously impeded bythe 52nd Division who at that moment were also assembling to attackon the following day Col Savill who was commanding the QueensWestminsters says that his men arrived dead beat at Nelly Avenueand Burg Support having been on the move all night He gives as thecause of the loss of direction the heavy machinegun fire which his      273troops met from the right on emerging from the trenches but a glanceat the map suggests another and more probable reason He was unable toassemble his battalion on a front conforming with the general line ofadvance The right of his leading companies was in Nelly Avenue andthe left in Burg Support with orders to swing round at right anglesto the Hindenburg systemIt was pointed out at the battle of the Somme that the complicatedmanuvre of changing direction at the commencement of an assaultshould be avoided It is probable that the commanding officer had noother alternative but the lesson is once more demonstrated To thedifficult task imposed upon them must be added the furtherembarrassment of never having seen the ground True that the attackdid not start until 1230 pm but it was extremely difficult to fixlandmarks owing to the country being so overgrown with long grass andweeds and in any case there was rising ground between Burg Supportand Bullecourt so that the few hours from dawn to the attack were oflittle benefitThe change of front by the left of the attacking force was furthercomplicated by the thick wire between the trenches of the HindenburgSystem Before any manuvre of the sort could be undertaken thesebelts of wire had to be passed and by the time this had beenaccomplished all idea of direction had fledThe London Rifle Brigade in close support to the QueensWestminsters had three companies in line the fourth company being insupport on the right and Battalion Headquarters on the left The leftand centre companies followed the Queens Westminsterseven in field    274practice this would probably occurThe 2nd London Regt was already reduced to 11 officers and 193 otherranks and assembled in Kings Avenue The two left companies followedthe Queens Westminsters while the two right companies fought downTunnel TrenchCol Savill believing his battalion to be more or less on their wayto Bullecourt moved with his headquarters down Burg Support and verysoon encountered the enemy He was joined by the headquarters of theLondon Rifle Brigade and the 2nd London Regt It was thought that themoppingup had been badly done and a message was sent forreinforcements while the staff details tried to bomb their wayforwardSoon after the attack opened therefore the 169th Brigade was tryingto capture Bullecourt with two companies of the London Rifle Brigadeon the right three battalion headquarter staffs and a few scatteredmen of the Queens Westminsters in the centre and two companies ofthe 2nd London Regt not a hundred men on the left The right whichwas the strongest part of the total force was definitely held up by astrong enemy garrison in Guardian and in other parts of the front theenemy resistance was too strong to be overcome by so weak a forceEventually a company of the 4th London Regt was sent up Burg Supportand by 5 pm progress had been made as far as the Hump But on theright the enemy who were being continually reinforced by troopsfalling back from the attack of the 167th Brigade through Croisillesstill held Guardian Reserve Guardian Reserve writes BrigGen       275Coke was a thorn in the side of the brigade until 6 pm Not onlywas the advance severely harassed from this place but no track forcarrying ammunition etc was available until it had been capturedBy 6 pm however the London Rifle Brigade reinforced by twocompanies of the Kensingtons and the 168th Trench Mortar Batterydrove the greater part of the remaining Germans to surrenderThe advance continued on the right as far as Pelican Avenue but inthe centre the Knuckle was not cleared until 5 am on the 29th Thesituation all through the afternoon and night of the 28th August wasmost complicated the 2nd London London Rifle Brigade 4th Londonand Kensington Regts being involved in a series of separateoperations dealing with scattered machinegun nests disposed intrenches and in broken groundDuring the afternoon the 168th Brigade had been ordered to move to LegLane and get in touch with the 167th Brigade also to be prepared tomove into Pelican Avenue with the object of attacking Bullecourt earlyin the morning of the 29th But owing to the state of affairs in themain Hindenburg System this was impossible and troops were movedinto position in daylight on the 29thMeanwhile all those troops who had gone careering about on the lefthad become mixed up with the 172nd Brigade in the neighbourhood ofCemetery Avenue to the north of Hendicourt They had suffered a numberof casualties and the remaining captain of the Queens Westminstershad returned wounded during the afternoon and had reported to the169th Brigade that he and the force of which he assumed command had      276occupied Pelican Lane This will give some idea of the difficultieswhich confronted BrigGen CokeThe attack was resumed in strength at 1 pm on the 29th The 168thBrigade were in Pelican Avenue with the Kensingtons on the right andthe London Scottish on the left right and left support being the 4thand 1st London RegtsPelican Lane appears to have been held by small parties of the enemyand the 169th Brigade assembled in the trenches northwest of thatplace But the missing companies with the exception of the 2nd LondonRegt had not returned The London Rifle Brigade led the attack withtwo companies having in close support 40 men of the QueensWestminsters which were all that could be found and behind them the2nd Londons with a total strength of 7 officers and 95 other ranksThe objective for the division was the trench system east ofBullecourt and south of Riencourt At the very start of the attack theKensingtons were held up at Station Redoubt but the London Scottishmade good progress on the left and by 215 pm were throughBullecourt The weak 169th Brigade made progress as far as SaddlerLane and the sunken road on the left of the village And the 57thDivision reported that they had captured Riencourt and were throughHendicourtTank Avenue was strongly held by the enemy and successfully arrestedany further advance in the centre and on the flanks the first checkwas not overcome And so the line remained with the London Scottishbulged out round Bullecourt and the Kensingtons bringing the rightflank back to Station Redoubt and the 169th Brigade the left flank      277to Saddler Lane The right of the division was in touch with the 3rdDivision but the position of the 57th was obscureThe 167th Brigade then relieved the whole of the divisional front andthe night passed in comparative quietnessAt about 5 am on the 30th the enemy counterattacked the lineHendicourtBullecourtEcoust in strength and drove the 167th Brigadeout of Bullecourt to the line Pelican Lane and Pelican Avenue At thesame time the 3rd Division on the right was driven out of Ecoust andon the left the 57th Division lost Riencourt and fell back on theBullecourtHendecourt road the enemy securing the factory on thatroadThe 167th Brigade at once attempted to regain Bullecourt but theenemy forces in Bullecourt received such strong support from theStation Redoubt that all efforts failed Gen Hull arranged for abombardment of the Station Redoubt by the heavy artilleryOrders from the Corps fixed the 31st August for a renewal of theattack in conjunction with the VI Corps on the left And so the 168thBrigade was once more ordered to take Bullecourt and the StationRedoubt relieving the 167th Brigade on that portion of the front Acompany of the latter brigade would then take up a position on theleft of the 168th Brigade and attack the factory The objective wasTank Support with the left flank thrown back to the factoryThe relief took place and all preparations were completed At 515am on the 31st the brigade advanced under a creeping barrage with     278the London Scottish on the right the 4th London Regt in the centreand the 7th Middlesex on the leftThe London Scottish carried the Station Redoubt and attackedBullecourt Avenue at 8 oclock obtaining touch with the 4th LondonsBut the latter regiment was held up in front of Bullecourt and on theleft the 7th Middlesex were unable to capture the factory A companyof the Kensingtons was sent up on the left and by 1015 am thefactory was captured and touch obtained with the 171st Brigade of thedivision on that flank Meanwhile the London Scottish had capturedBullecourt AvenueAt 1 oclock an artillery observer reported the enemy advancing overthe open and assembling in Tank Avenue and Support All field guns andthe heavy artillery was concentrated on this target and nocounterattack developed But the plans were modified to the captureof the village onlyTwo companies of the Kensingtons were sent up as reinforcements andbombing from the flanks was carried on round the village By the timeit was dark only the eastern portion was not cleared up and the enemyremained in Gordon ReserveThe 56th Division was then relieved by the 52nd and marched out ofthe line to rest about Boyelles The captures during these operationswere     29 officers 1047 other ranks     2 77mm guns and 1 8inch howitzer     200 machine guns and over 50 trench mortarsThe casualties of the division were     123 officers and 2381 other ranks  [Illustration 9 THE BATTLES OF ALBERT  THE SCARPE 1918]The hardworking but cheery artillery remained in the line Allthrough the battle they had pushed forward close behind the infantry    279On the 25th August the Guards Artillery had returned to their owndivision and as a consequence the 56th Divisional front had beencovered by the 57th Divisional Artillery on the right and their ownartillery on the left At this time the 13th and 22nd Brigades of theRoyal Garrison Artillery had been affiliated with the 56th DivisionalArtillery The enemy paid the closest attention to our artillerybombarding the battery positions incessantly with highexplosive andgas shellsOn the 29th early in the morning all brigades of artillery advancedto the outskirts of Croisilles In the previous fighting they had been1200 yards behind the infantry in Summit Trench On this same day the232nd Army Brigade RFA was transferred to the 56th Division andformed an independent group with SOS lines superimposed After theadvance in the morning the 56th Divisional Artillery became the rightgroup and the 57th the left group And the next day the 40thDivisional Artillery replaced the 57thThe artillery passed under the command of the 40th and then the 63rdDivisions and eventually withdrew from the line on the 5th Septemberall ranks and horses having suffered

great offensive had started there was no pause in thefighting Divisions were relieved to reorganise Sometimes they stoodtheir ground so that supplies could be brought up and so that theymight not shoot too far ahead of the base from which supplies weredrawn The turmoil of the front line was assuredly no greater than theturmoil in rear of the fighting troops Activity effort unendingtoil went on behind the line as well as in the line As the troopsdrove the enemy in front of them so engineers stood ready to rebuildthe shattered railways and reconstruct the shellbattered roads Butthe Army Service Corps could not stand still while the railways androads were in the hands of the engineers They had to struggle forwardas best they could and it is to their everlasting industry that thetroops in the fighting areas were fed clothed supplied withammunition and very frequently indeed provided with waterWhen the infantry of the 56th Division returned to Boyelles the placewas unrecognisable The railway was through Trains were in Boyellesand lines of lorries stood being loaded by a swarm of men It was acheering sight for the tired but happy divisionMeanwhile the advance continued fiercely opposed but irresistible     282On the right of Bullecourt the Fourth and Third Armies had by thenight of the 30th reached a line from ClrysurSomme past thewestern edge of Marrires Wood to Combles les Bufs BancourtFremicourt and Vraucourt And south of Pronne Allied infantry hadreached the left bank of the Somme from Nesle to the north Farthersouth still the French held Noyon On the 1st September theAustralians entered PronneOn the left of Bullecourt the First Army had advanced we have alreadynoted the advance of the Canadians and were now on the high groundeast of Cherisy and Hautcourt and had captured Eterpigny On thenorth of the Scarpe we had captured Plouvain The QuantDrocourt linewas now within assaulting distanceThis powerful line ran from the Hindenburg Line at Quant to Drocourtin the neighbourhood of Lens and was attacked by the Canadian Corpsand 4th Division of the First Army and the 52nd 57th and 63rdDivisions of the Third Army on the 2nd September It was one of thegreatest assaults of the war and was completely successfulAs the 56th Division knew very well the Germans had been contestingevery inch of the ground But now the enemy were in a mostunfavourable position and started to fall back on the whole of theThird Army front and on the right of the First Army On the 3rdSeptember the enemy was on the line of the Canal du Nord on thefollowing day he commenced to withdraw from the east bank of theSomme south of Pronne and on the night of the 8th September was onthe line Vermand Epehy Havrincourt and so along the east bank ofthe canalMeanwhile the division rested bathed and reorganised Divisional       283Headquarters were at Boisleux St Marc and on the 3rd September SirDouglas Haig visited Gen Hull and congratulated him on the good workdone for the divisionOn the 4th a warning order followed by one of confirmation wasreceived that the division would move to the QuantPronville area inreadiness to relieve the 63rd Division in the line on the 5th But atmidday on the 5th this order was cancelled Meanwhile the 167th and169th Brigades had already moved to the new area and so had a uselessmarch back againOn the same day Gen Hull was informed that his division would betransferred to the XXII Corps and would relieve the 1st Division inthe line command to pass on the 9thDue north of Cambrai there is a very marshy tract of land It was afeature it will be remembered in the scheme of attack on Cambrai in1917 These ponds are fed by the Sense and Cojeul Rivers and theCanal du Nord is planned to run up after passing Muvres byInchyenArtois Marquion to a place called Palleul where it cutsacross this marsh and joins up with the Canal de lEscaut and theCanal de la Sense This water covers a stretch of ground running wellto the west towards the Scarpe and tails off near a village calledEtaing When the Canadians made their gallant and successful attack onthe QuantDrocourt line the left flank of the advance rested on theponds and marshes of the Sense and this was the front which the 56thDivision was to take overThe line was well up to the water and extended from a point about 500    284yards north of Eterpigny south of Etaing south of Lecleuse andjoined with the Canadians 1500 yards east of RcourtThe relief of the 1st Division took place on the 6th 7th and 8thcommand passing at 10 am on the 9th September The enemy was quietbut the weather was bad cold and showeryOn the 16th it was arranged that the 4th Division should relieve the11th on the left and that the 56th would extend the front held totheir right taking over from the 3rd Canadian Division Battalionsthen engaged in a series of sidestepping reliefs to the right untilon the 25th the right of the division was on the ArrasCambrai roadOn this day the only incident of note occurred when the enemy twiceattempted to raid the London Scottish and was on each occasiondriven off with lossBy this time preparations were complete for a further advance acrossthe Canal du Nord on the 27th September The crossing of the canal wasto be forced by the Canadian Corps when the 11th and 56th Divisionswould relieve the left of the Canadians and attack due north along theeastern bank of the canal and towards the marshes of the Sense The56th Division would be on the leftthat is to say they would advancealong the canal bank The 169th Brigade was given the task ofattacking along the eastern bank and the 168th was to clear up thewestern bankThe great attack on the 27th September met with the fiercestopposition It was obviously of vital importance to the enemy tomaintain his front opposite St Quentin and Cambrai The advance ofthe British Armies was striking directly at the allimportant lateral    285communications running through Maubeuge to Hirson and Mezires bywhich alone the German forces on the Champagne front could be suppliedand maintained It had been decided that the Americans were to attackwest of the Meuse in the direction of Mezires the French west of theArgonne with the same general objectives and the Belgians in thedirection of Ghent The British attack in the centre was where theenemys defences were most highly organised and if these were brokenthe threat directed at his vital communications would react on hisdefence elsewhereThe British attack was too largely on the field of a former attackin 1917 but there was this difference the Canadians had smashedthrough the QuantDrocourt system on the left This would make theattack on the Bourlon Wood positions somewhat easier But the wholesystem of defence round and about the Hindenburg Line varied in depthbetween 7000 and 10000 yards and was a most formidable series offortificationsThe First and Third Armies attacked with the IV VI XVII andCanadian Corps the operation of the 56th Division being on theextreme left and subsequent to the launching of the main attack Theproblem on the left which the 56th Division helped to solve was thatthe northern portion of the canal was too formidable an obstacle to becrossed in the face of the enemy and it was therefore necessary toforce a passage on the narrow front about Muvres and turn the lineof the canal farther north by a divergent attack developed fanwisefrom the point of crossingThe morning broke wet and misty The wind was from the west and         286carried the opening crash of the British barrage at 530 am wellbehind the German lines But they did not need this sort of warningFor days they had watched the assembling of batteries stores agigantic army behind the infantry who were ever keeping a steadypressure on their advanced lines Prepared as they were howevernothing could stop the assaulting lines of Canadians News came in tothe 56th Division early that all was going wellEnemy retaliation on the 56th Division was slight and practicallyceased by 540 am But as the morning progressed it became apparentthat the Canadians were meeting with strong opposition on the extremeleft They were timed to reach a line immediately south of Sauchy bymidday and the 169th Brigade was to carry on the attack from thereat 248 pmBrigGen Coke ordered the London Rifle Brigade to send a company assoon as the barrage would permit to establish posts on the east bankof the canal and cover the Royal Engineers who were to build abridge about 1000 yards north of the ArrasCambrai road A similarbridge was to be made some 300 yards south of the road The northernbridge was to be complete by 11 am and the southern one by middayBut the village of Marquion was on the east of the canal and on theArrasCambrai road and at 1145 am the village was still holdingout which made it impossible for the 169th Brigade to keep to thetimetable and be in position for attack by 248 pm It was thereforedecided to postpone the attack until 328 pmMeanwhile the Engineers 513th Coy and 512th Coy and Pioneers had    287gone forward to construct their bridges and had found themselvesopposed by hostile infantry They however cleared the eastern bankand commenced to buildAt midday it was reported that Marquion was clear and the 2nd LondonRegt started to cross about that time followed by the QueensWestminsters and the London Rifle Brigade The advance of the 169thBrigade to the assembly positions completed the clearing of the groundbehind the Canadiansthe Queens Westminsters capturing no less than50 prisoners from fighting groups they met with before forming upAt three oclock the brigade was in position with the 2nd Londons onthe right and the Queens Westminsters on the left The London RifleBrigade had one company between the two branches of the River Agacheclearing up the ground and two companies in support of the 2ndLondons the fourth company was engaged in covering the Engineers whowere making the northern bridgeThe attack swiftly reached and captured all the small copses KamweziKiduna and Cemetery which yielded many prisoners but the 2ndLondons were checked by machinegun nests on the railway embankmentsouthwest of Oisy The 2nd Londons and the London Rifle Brigadeattacked four times without success and on the fifth the survivingenemy and their machine guns were capturedThe Queens Westminsters met with the same sort of opposition Theswampy ground in the triangle where the Agache joins the canal was aneffective obstacle behind which the enemy had placed machine gunswhich swept the line of advance But the Queens Westminsters            288worked cunningly round by the banks of the Agache and eventuallysurrounded the Germans capturing 1 officer and 22 other ranks 21dead bodies were counted in the post By 7 pm the line of therailway southwest of Oisy was held and with the capture of a finalmachinegun nest defending the canal bridge east of Mill Copse theQueens Westminsters reached the final objective of the attack earlyin the morning of the 28thThe task of advancing on the western bank of the canal was given tothe 168th Brigade and was carried out by the Kensingtons For someway they advanced in line with the Queens Westminsters but were thenheld up by machine guns in Mill Copse The country was extremelydifficult owing to water Mill Copse could only be approached by anarrow pav lane which was flooded and much blocked by fallen treesAt 630 pm the leading company was about 500 yards south of thecopse and it was decided not to attempt its capture by daylight butto wait for the moon The advance was then continued at 2 am andreached the final objective without oppositionThe following day the 169th Brigade pushed on to the marsh land eastof Palleul meeting with no resistance but securing a few prisonersAltogether this brigade captured over 400 prisoners and 34 machinegunsThe total captures of the division were 12 officers 501 other ranks45 machine guns and 10 trench mortarsThe 8th Middlesex 167th Brigade then entered the village of Palleulafter making a temporary bridge over the blownup causeway andestablished a bridgehead at Arleux a village on the north of the        289marshes The enemy made a small attack in this direction on the 29thand drove in the bridgehead they also shelled Palleul with mustardgasBut the German resistance was broken Gouzeaucourt MarcoingNoyellessurlEscaut FontaineNotreDame and Sailly had beencaptured together with over 10000 prisoners and 200 gunsConsternation reigned at the headquarters of the Central Powers TheAustrian Peace Note made its appearance on the 15th SeptemberBulgaria surrendered on the 29th and Damascus fell on the 20th TheGerman troops on the Western Front fought desperately and well butthey were being beaten and frequently on the British front byinferior numbersThe actual position held by the 56th Division was along the marshyground on both banks of the canal It included Palleul and the Bois deQuesnoy But on the 30th the front was prolonged to the right whenthe 168th Brigade took over from the 11th Division up to a point onthe eastern outskirts of Aubencheu The enemy were very alert andopened heavy machinegun fire on the approach of patrols And on the6th they set fire to Aubenchaul When the fires had died down patrolsestablished posts on the bank of the canalThis burning business was carried on extensively Fires accompaniedby explosions were continually breaking out behind the enemy linesOn the 9th October the division was ordered to take over a furtherlength of front and relieve the whole of the 11th Division who hadtheir right flank on the village of Fressies The object was to freethe 11th Division so that they could follow the enemy who were         290evacuating the area between the Canal de lEscaut and the SenseCanal as the result of the capture of Cambrai by the Canadian CorpsBattle of Cambrai 8th9th OctoberDuring the day it was found that the enemy were actually retiring onthe 11th Division front and the 56th Division was ordered toascertain whether the villages of Arleux AubignyauBac andBrunement were still occupied Both the 167th Brigade on the left andthe 168th on the right sent out patrols which were fired on andengaged by the enemy the moment they crossed the canal In Arleuxquite an exciting patrol action was fought in which four of the enemywere killedThe relief of the 11th Division was completed by six in the eveningPatrols found that the enemy was still holding Fressies and the 168thBrigade was ordered to attack and capture that villageThe operation was carried out by the Kensingtons who stormed thevillage most successfully at 7 am on the 11th October Two companiesonly attacked and the casualties were 1 killed and 9 wounded On theother hand they captured 2 officers and 39 other ranks A mostpraiseworthy little actionThe enemy was now cleared from the south bank of the canal along thewhole of the divisional front The 11th Division pressing forwardwas still on the right of the 56th and on the left was the 1stCanadian Division Farther on the left was the VIII Corps and onthis same day they captured VitryenArtois and drove the enemy backon Douai On receipt of this news the 56th Divisional Artillery wasordered to keep the crossings of the canal from Arleux northwardsunder fire and the 167th Brigade were instructed to push forward        291patrols and obtain a footing in Arleux if possible This they wereunable to do in face of the machinegun fire and a most unfavourableapproachIn the evening the division passed to the command of the CanadianCorps The 1st Canadian Division on the left of the 56th had beenpushing forward on the north of the ponds and marshes for some daysand on the 12th they captured Arleux in the early hours of themorning The 167th Brigade cooperated in clearing up the southernportion of the village and relieved all Canadian troops so as toinclude Arleux in the divisional frontMeanwhile during the night 12th13th October the 169th Brigaderelieved the 168th on the right A clever and daring enterprise tocapture AubignyauBac was then undertaken in the words of Gen Hullinitiated and carried out entirely under the orders of theBrigadierGeneral commanding the 169th Infantry Brigade who deservesgreat credit for the successful exploitThe 169th Brigade held the right sector with the London Rifle Brigadeand the Queens Westminsters in line and as the front was veryextended BrigGen Coke decided to attempt the capture of thevillage with two companies of the 2nd London RegtThe problem he had before him was to attack across the Canal de laSense which was 70 feet wide and had no bridges Strong German postswere stationed at two points where bridges had formerly existedabout 1200 yards apart and he decided to cross between these twodestroyed bridgesAbsolute silence was essential for the success of the scheme The        292416th Field Coy RE was ordered to construct rafts to carry over anofficers patrol of the Queens Westminsters as soon as possible afterdark and after landing the officers were to ascertain whether asufficiently large area free of the enemy existed for the assemblyof the attacking company If it was found that there was room for acompany the engineers were to construct a floating footbridge forthem to crossThe time for making reconnaissance and bringing up material was veryshort The men who were to attack had to carry up the material It wasraining and the approach was over marshy ground All the men were wetto the skin before even the bridge was startedLieut Arnold of the 416th Field Coy had silence and speed toconsider and also the amount of material which could be brought up inany given time He decided he would not waste precious minutes overrafts but would proceed at once with the footbridge By threeoclock in the morning the bridge had been constructed and the patrolof Queens Westminsters went across One cannot give higher praise tothe engineers than this on landing the patrol found that they couldnot proceed more than ten paces in any direction without beingchallenged by German sentriesthere appeared to be three posts in theimmediate vicinity of the bridgeIt seemed as though the enterprise must be abandoned But as the enemyhad not opened fire the brigadier ordered the patrol to try to rushthe posts without raising an alarmThe bridge was from its very nature an unstable affair with nohandrail and owing to the rain which never ceased a very slippery    293surface The night however was very dark and the rain was perhaps agreat advantage A platoon of the 2nd Londons crossed over stealthilyand quickly overpowered two Germans which was all the enemy forcethey found The remaining platoons of the attacking company nowcrossed overThe assembly area was far from a good one being intersected by twosmall streams La Navie and La Petite Navie of which nothing wasknown The artillery barrage was arranged against the flank of theenemy position creeping in a northwesterly direction To follow itin an ordinary way was out of the question as the country was cut upby many hedges and ditches So platoons were directed to make theirown way to various points as soon as the barrage startedAt 430 am Capt Sloan who was in command of the company had hismen assembled as well as he was able in the blackness of earlymorning when dawn is postponed by rain and thick lowflying cloudsIn silence they waited for zero which was at 515 amThe rest is a story of complete and absolute surprise The attack camefrom the least threatened side of the enemy position Two machinegunteams tried to resist but after several had been killed the restthrew up their hands Altogether about 160 prisoners were taken in thevillagePosts were established on the outskirts of the village but it was notfound possible to occupy the station where the enemy was strong andthoroughly roused and so the momentary hope that Brunemont might alsobe surprised vanishedAt 6 am two platoons of the supporting company came up and were used   294to reinforce the posts already establishedThe enemy now began to show fight Two machine guns worked up closeand gave Capt Sloan a lot of trouble They were engaged with riflegrenades and rushed successfully The remaining portion of the supportcompany was moved across the canal and into the villageAs the morning advanced and the light grew better the infantryobservation posts in Quesnoy Wood reported parties of the enemy movingtowards Aubigny These were quickly dispersed with many casualtiesby the artillery who also put to flight the crews of several trenchmortars which were giving some troubleAbout ten oclock a heavy enemy barrage was put down on the villagetogether with a concentration of machinegun fire This lasted forhalf an hour and was followed by a most determined attack with aforce estimated at a battalion from the north and a smaller forcefrom Brunemont In spite of heavy losses the Germans pressed on andslowly outflanked one post after another greatly aided by trenchmortars The 2nd Londons were pressed back to La Petite Navie streamwhere a stand was made and the enemy prevented from debauching fromthe villageBeing familiar with the ground however the enemy made full use ofthe hedges and although the four Stokes mortars of the brigadebattery which supported the 2nd Londons did exceedingly good workit became advisable to fall back farther to the canal bankA bridgehead was maintained for some time but at 5 pm all troops      295had returned to the southern bank They brought with them three enemymachine guns and threw ten others into the canalBut in the early morning when still dark a patrol started to crossover the bridge with the object of establishing a post on the northbank The enemy was so close that the end of the bridge was withinbombing distance This caused the men to bunch with the result thatthe bridge broke Cpl McPhie and Sapper Cox of the 416th Field CoyRE jumped into the water and held the cork floats which supportedthe structure together getting their fingers badly trodden on by thepatrol But the patrol crossed before the two gallant men let go CplMcPhie realising the serious position of the men who had crossed tothe north side set about gathering material to repair and strengthenthe bridge Daylight came on apace but the corporal never wavered inhis intention Having assembled what he wanted in the nature of woodhe led the way with the curt remark to his men Weve got to make away for the patrolits a deathorglory jobThe patrol on the north bank helped him to the best of their powerbut they had the slenderest hold on that side of the canal It wasdaylight and enemy snipers were concealed in every hedge Thecorporal started to work with bullets cracking like whips round hisears He was shot in the head and fell in the water Sapper Cox triedto pull him out but Cpl McPhie had sufficient strength to tell himto leave go as he himself was done Sapper Cox persisted in hisefforts The enemy fire increased the corporal was hit again andagain Sapper Cox had six bullets through him The corporal was dead    296and Cox let go of his bodyThen Sapper Hawkins ran to the bank and threw a rope to Cox Thiswonderful man still had the strength to hold on to it while Hawkinsdrew him ashoreCox died two days laterMcPhie was awarded the Victoria Cross                                         In this very fine enterprise 3 officers and 87 other ranks formed theattacking party Altogether 6 officers and 165 other ranks passed overthe canal But this small force captured 4 officers and 203 otherranks The casualties suffered by the whole of the 2nd Londons duringthe day were 3 officers and 140 other ranksUntil the 169th Brigade handed over to the 10th Canadian InfantryBrigade on the 14th October they held the bridgehead and patrolledthe north bank of the canal But on the 15th the Germans succeeded inrushing the bridgehead although they failed to get anyidentificationOn relief the 169th Brigade moved back to SauchyCauchy and the168th who were in reserve entrained for Arras On the 15th the 167thBrigade was relieved by the 11th Canadian Brigade and moved toRumancourt On the 16th the whole division was in the outskirts ofArras with headquarters at Etrun except the artillery  [Illustration 10 BATTLE OF THE CANAL DU NORD]All through these weeks of fighting a great strain had been imposed onthe Royal Army Service Corps and the Divisional Ammunition Column Theroads were bad and fearfully congested and the distances were great     297and continually changing When the great advance commenced railheadwas at a place called Tincques on the 23rd August it changed toGouyenArtois on the 27th to Beaumetz on the 31st toBoisleuxauMont On the 8th September it was at Arras and on the 11thOctober at Quant Not for one moment had supplies failed to be up totime The work of this branch of the organisation was excellent andthe work of these units of supply should always be borne in mind inevery account of actions fought and big advances madeThe artillery remained in the line until the 23rd October and thenrested in the neighbourhood of Cambrai until the 31st October                                         The whole of the Hindenburg Line passed into our possession during theearly part of October and a wide gap was driven through such systemsof defence as existed behind it The threat at the enemyscommunications was now direct There were no further

under Gen Birdwood This army was in front of the Lyssalient which was thus left between the northern and southern attackswith the perilous prospect of being cut off On the 2nd October the

training and restinground Etrun and Arras Organisation of battalions was overhauled inaccordance with a pamphlet numbered OB1919 and issued by theGeneral Staff It was designed to deal with the decreasing strength ofbattalions but as it supposed a greater number of men than were inmany cases available it was troublesomeThe outstanding points were that platoons would now be composed of tworifle and two Lewisgun sections that a platoon so long as it          299contained two sections of three men each was not to be amalgamatedwith any other platoon and that not more than six men and onenoncommissioned officer to each section should be taken into action     The fighting efficiency of the section says the pamphlet     is of primary importance and every endeavour must be made     to strengthen the sections if necessary by the recall of     employed men and men at courses or even by withdrawing men     from the administrative portions of battalion and company     headquarters which must in an emergency be temporarily     reduced After the requirements of the fighting portion for     reconstruction have been met 50 other ranks if the     battalion is up to its full establishment a balance of 208     men will remain for the administrative portion 90 and for     reinforcements This balance will include men undergoing     courses of instruction men on leave and in rest camps men     sick but not evacuated and men on army corps divisional     or brigade employ These latter must be reduced to the     lowest figure possible and will in no case exceed 30 men     per battalionThe order against the amalgamation of platoons applied also tosections but was not invariably carried out by company commanders Ithad become a universal practice to detail six men and onenoncommissioned officer to each post With double sentries this gaveeach man one hour on and two hours offanything less than thesenumbers threw a big strain on the men and so long as the companycommander had sufficient men for an adequate number of sentry postshe made them up of that numberThe details of a battalion as arranged by this pamphlet are              300interesting  [Header

Guards fatigueparties sudden demands for men from higher commands dozens ofreasons could be given for the evaporation of strength Probablytwothirds only of these men were really available for fighting Inthose days a general when inspecting companies had no difficulty infinding fault if he wished to do soDuring the rest Gen Hull discussed the subjects of organisation andtraining with the officers of each of his brigadesBut in the evening officers and men could be cheered by Bow Bellswhich were to be heard at the theatre in Arras and the cinema at HautAvesnesOn the 31st the division moved into XXII Corps Reserve withheadquarters at Basseville and on the 1st November was ordered torelieve the 49th Division during the night 2nd3rdOn the 31st October the line immediately south of Valenciennes restedon the 4th Canadian Division from the Canal de lEscaut to theoutskirts of the village of Famars the 49th Division on the highground west of the River Rondelle the 4th Division astride the riverand to the east of Artres and then the 61st DivisionThe 4th and 49th Divisions of the XXII Corps attacked on the 2ndNovember with the object of capturing the two villages of Preseau andSaultain but only the first was taken and the 49th Division held thePreseauValenciennes roadThe 56th Division was now plunged into real open fighting Theirobjectives were no longer trench lines but tactical features such as   302spurs rivers woods and villages An examination of Gen Hullsoperation orders reveals the new nature of the fightingThe 169th Brigade was given the right and the 168th the left Theobjective of the XXII Corps which was attacking with the 11thDivision on the right and the 56th on the left was given as thegeneral line of the Aunelle River left bank The Canadian Corpswould cover the left flank of the 56th Division by the capture ofEstreux The division would be covered by six brigades of fieldartilleryOn attaining the high ground on the left of the Aunelle River patrolswould be pushed out since if there is any sign of enemy retreat theGOC intends to push on mounted troops to secure the crossing of thePetite Aunelle River and will order the leading brigades to supportthem The mounted troops referred to were two squadrons of AustralianLight HorseEach of the attacking brigades had at the disposal of the Brigadier abattery of field artillery also two sections 8 guns of the MGBattalionAs the front to be covered by the 56th Division was very extensivethe 146th Brigade of the 49th Division remained in line on the leftand was to advance until squeezed out by the converging advance of the56th and Canadian DivisionsOn the night 2nd3rd November the 169th and 168th Brigades relievedthe right of the 49th Division on the PreseuxValenciennes roadwithout incident Soon after 8 am on the 3rd patrols reported thatthe enemy had retired The two brigades advanced and occupiedSaultain which was full of civilians before midday The cavalry anda company of New Zealand Cyclists were then ordered to push forward      303and secure the crossings of the River Aunelle The line of the leftbank of the river was reached at 6 pm where machinegun fire wasencountered The brigades remained on that line for the nightThe advance was resumed at dawn on the 4th when the QueensWestminster Rifles crossed the River Aunelle and captured the villageof Sebourg there was some halfhearted opposition from about thirtyof the enemy who were rounded up but when they attempted to advanceeast of the village they came under intense machinegun and rifle firefrom the high ground Attempt to turn the enemy flank met with nosuccess and as there was no artillery barrage arranged BrigGenCoke contented himself by holding the road to the east of the villageThe 168th Brigade on the left were also held up by the enemy on thehigh ground The 4th London Regt led the attack and took the hamletof Sebourtquiaux slightly north of Sebourg only to find that theywere not only faced with the enemy on the high ground to the east butthat heavy enfilade fire was being directed on them from the villageof Rombies on the western bank of the river and on the CanadianCorps front The 4th London Regt took up a position to the east ofSebourtquiaux and astride the river and so remained for the nightBattle of the SambreThis attack had been made without artillery preparation but theposition of the artillery is well described by BrigGen Elkington ina short report drawn up at the end of the operations He says thebarrage put down on the 1st November had been a very heavy one andthat the enemy never again waited for the full weight of the artillery   304to get into action     The problem for the artillery then became a matter of     dealing with machinegun nests isolated guns and small     parties of the enemy who were delaying our advance and     enabling the main body of the enemy to retire The enemy     blew up bridges and roads whenever possible to delay the     advance of our guns In these circumstances the following     points were emphasised     1 The benefit of allotting artillery to each battalion     commander in the front line The battery commander by     remaining with the battalion commander and keeping good     communication with his battery could bring fire to bear at     very short time on targets as they were encountered In     practice it was generally found that a full battery was too     large a unit and that four guns or even a section was of     more use     2 When more than one artillery brigade was available for     an infantry brigade the necessity of keeping them cheloned     in depth and maintaining all but one brigade on wheels If     resistance was encountered the brigade or brigades on     wheels in rear could be moved up to reinforce the artillery     in the line to put down a barrage for an attack or if no     resistance was encountered a brigade in rear could advance     through the artillery in action which in turn could get on     wheels as the advancing brigade came into action This     procedure enabled brigades to get occasional days rests and     obviated the danger of getting roads choked with advancing     artillery     3 The necessity of impressing on infantry commanders that     though at the commencement of an attack it is possible to     support them with a great weight of artillery it is not     possible to push this mass of artillery forward when     movement becomes rapid and that if they push forward               305     rapidly they are better served by a small mobile allotment     of gunsThe rapidity of the advance was little short of marvellous for onemust remember that it did not depend on the ability of the infantry tomarch forward but on the engineers behind them who werereconstructing the roads and railways for the supply servicesLieutCol Sutton who was controlling the Quartermasters Branch ofthe division has a note in his diary     The enemy has done his demolition work most effectively     Craters are blown at road junctions and render roads     impassable especially in villages where the rim of the     crater comes in many cases up to the walls of the houses     Culverts are blown on main roads and a particularly     effective blockage is caused in one place by blowing a     bridge across a road and stream so that all the material     fell across the road and in the riverThis demolition was the great feature of the advance The infantrycould always go across country but guns and lorries were not alwaysable to use these short cuts The weather was unfavourable as itrained practically every day When craters were encountered theleading vehicles could perhaps get round by going off the road butthey had the effect of churning up the soft ground so that the cratersoon became surrounded by an impassable bog The engineers and 5thCheshires worked like Trojans to fill up these terrific pits or makea firm surface round themAt this date railhead was at AubignyauBac the scene of that greatexploit of the 2nd London Regt And when one takes into account dates    306and distances the achievement of those who were working behind theinfantry must be ranked as one of the finest in the war One cannotget a picture of the advance by considering the mere width of an armyfront The infantry were the spearhead the supplies the shaft butthe hand that grasped the whole weapon and drove it forward was thatof the engineer the pioneer the man of the Labour Battalion Theeffort of the army then must be considered in depth from the scout tothe baseUnder these circumstances communication between units became a matterof vital importance The ordinary administrative routine of trenchwarfare required little modification up to the point of the breakthrough the Hindenburg Lineafter that it became impossible BrigadeHeadquarters were responsible for the distribution of rationsengineer material ordnance mails and billeting In the orders foradvance the General Staff informed the BrigadierGeneral what unitsor portion of divisional troops including Divisional Artillery wouldbe under his tactical control and these units irrespective of theirarm of the service constituted the Brigade Group The supply ofammunition on the other hand was worked by arms of the service andnot by Brigade Groups The channel of supply being the ordinaryonefrom the Divisional Ammunition Column to batteries or InfantryBrigade Reserve or Machinegun Battalion Reserve                                         The administrative instructions for the division point out     The outstanding difficulty in all the administrative     services will be that of intercommunication between the             307     troops and the chelons in rear which supply them The     system of interchange of orderlies between the forward and     rear chelons has been found unsatisfactory as if the two     chelons both move at the same time all touch is lost     Prior to the advance therefore the administrative staff of     each brigade group will fix a meetingpoint or rear     report centre as far forward as possible on the probable     line of advance This point will serve as a rendezvous for     all maintenance service The principle of     intercommunication by means of a fixed report centre will     also be adopted by Divisional Artillery and the Machine Gun     Battalion for the purpose of ammunition supplyThis arrangement does not seem to have worked well for the artilleryas we find BrigGen Elkington reporting     For a time communication by orderly between units became     the only feasible plan Owing to the rapid movement these     orderlies had the utmost difficulty in locating units In     this Divisional Artillery the system of using village     churches as report centres was successfully tried but     owing to the cessation of hostilities the trial was not as     exhaustive as could be wished Notices showing change of     location were simply stuck on the church doors or railings     and orderlies were instructed to at once proceed to the     church for information on entering a villageThis modification of the original scheme would seem to be a usefuloneIn spite of all these difficulties the 56th Division was advancingOn the 5th November a barrage was arranged to cover troops attackingthe high ground to the east of the River Aunelle as a preliminary       308to subsequent advance The London Rifle Brigade led the attack of the169th Brigade at 530 am and by 730 am had captured the villageof Angreau Here they were checked by the enemy who occupied thewoods on both banks of the Honnelle River On their right the 11thDivision captured the village of Roisin but on their left the 168thBrigade had not made such good progressAttacking with the London Scottish on the right and the Kensingtonson the left the 168th Brigade were much hampered by flank fire fromAngre and the ground to their left which was still held by the enemyThe situation was somewhat eased by the capture of Rombies by the 4thCanadian Division and at 3 pm the artillery put down a rollingbarrage behind which the Kensingtons and the London Scottish ontheir right advanced to the outskirts of Angre The position for thenight was on the high ground west of the River Grande HonnelleThe enemy had determined to defend the crossing of the river and hadan excellent position on the eastern bank where they held the Bois deBeaufort in strength The advance was to be resumed at 530 am butjust before that hour the German artillery put down a heavy barrage ofgasshells Undaunted the 2nd Londons on the right and the LondonRifle Brigade on the left of the 169th Brigade attacked in gasmasksand crossed the river The 168th Brigade attacking with the LondonScottish and Kensingtons in line met at first with slight resistancebut as soon as the river was reached they were faced with a heavybarrage of artillery and machinegun fire In spite of very accuratefire they succeeded in crossing the river to the north and south of     309Angre The position in front of them was of considerable naturalstrength but was turned by a clever move of the London Scottish fromthe south which established them firmly on the east bank TheKensingtons advanced to the high ground immediately east of thevillage of Angre and here met a heavy counterattack which drove themback to the west bankMeanwhile the 169th Brigade was engaged in heavy fighting Only thenorthern portion of the Bois de Beaufort was included in the attackand the enemy were found to be strongly situated on ground whichdominated the western bank of the river The attack was delivered withspirit and the enemy driven back The 2nd Londons had the wood infront of them and the London Rifle Brigade shot ahead on the leftoutside the wood The enemy rallied and counterattacked the forwardtroops while at the same time a force of Germans debouched from thewood on the right flank of the Rifle Brigade men who were driven backto the west of the river Some of the 2nd Londons were involved inthis successful enemy counterattack but a party of fortya largeparty in those daysheld on to the position they had reached in theBois de Beaufort until late in the afternoon when discovering whathad happened on the left and being almost entirely surrounded theyretired fighting to the western bank of the riverThe right brigade therefore remained on the west bank Thecasualties had been heavy amounting to 394The London Scottish had retained their hold of the east bank andlater in the afternoon the Kensingtons again succeeded in crossing       310the river and definitely established themselves to the east and intouch with the London Scottish The casualties of the 168th Brigadeduring these operations were 207 The prisoners captured by them were111 The prisoners captured by the 169th Brigade were 43The general destruction of roads combined with the vile weather nowbegan to cause anxiety Horses were used as much as possiblea horsecan drag a cart through places which would be impossible for a motorlorryand civilian wagons were pressed into service being used inconjunction with spare army horses This was all the more necessary asthe administrative branch of the division had the additionalresponsibility of feeding civiliansAll the villages captured or occupied by the troops were filled withcivilians So great was their emotion on their release that theypressed whatever they had in the nature of food and drink on thetroops The coffeepot of the French or Belgian housewife wasreplenished with reckless disregard for tomorrow And then as thecountry was regained so the villagers were cut off from the sourcewhich had provided them with their limited supplies With Germans inretreat on one side and roads blown up on the other they were moreisolated than they had ever been On the 6th November the 56thDivision was rationing 16000 civilians and most of this work wasbeing done by the transport of the 168th and 169th Brigades  [Illustration 11 GENERAL MAP]The battle on the right of the division had progressed with almostunfailing success The 11th Division on their immediate right had metwith the same check on the River Honnelle but farther south the Armyhad forced their way through the great Forest of Mormal and troops      311were well to the east of it The German rearguards were only able onespecially favourable positions to check the advance of a fewdivisions on the whole the rearguards were being thrown back on themain retreating force The roads were packed with enemy troops andtransport and the real modern cavalry the lowflying aeroplanesswooped down on them with bomb and machine gun spreading panic andcausing the utmost confusionDuring the night 6th7th November the 63rd Division was put into lineon the front of the 168th Brigade and the 169th was relieved by the167th Brigade The 56th Division was then on a single brigade frontwith the 11th Division on the right and the 63rd on the leftAt dawn on the 7th patrols found that the enemy was still in front ofthem and at 9 am the brigade attacked with the 8th Middlesex on theright and the 7th Middlesex on the left They swept on through thenorthern part of the wood and by 1030 am the 7th Middlesex enteredthe village of Onnezies The Petite Honnelles River was crossed andthe village of Montignies taken in the afternoon But after theBavaiHensies Road was crossed opposition stiffened and bothartillery and machinegun fire became severe A line of outposts heldthe east of the road for the nightExplosions and fires which were continually observed at night behindthe enemy lines were more numerous on the night of 7th8th and whenthe advance was continued at 8 am the two Middlesex battalionsoccupied the villages of Athis and FaytleFranc with practically noopposition By nightfall outposts were covering Petit Moranfayt Trieu   312Jean Sart Ferlibray and RichonThe road situation was worse than ever Railhead was atAubignyauBac and supply lorries were unable to proceed any fartherthan the Honnelle River owing to the destruction of the bridges Rainfell all the time and crosscountry tracts were impassable Alltraffic was thrown on the main roads which to the west of the riverwere now in such a state that all supplies were late Arrangementswere made for aeroplanes to drop food to the advance troops butfortunately this was found unnecessaryThe enemy was now in full retreat on the whole of the British frontTo the south the Guards Division entered Maubeuge and to the norththe Canadians were approaching Mons The 56th Division marched forwardthrough the villages of Coron RieudeBury QuevyleGrand andQuevylePetit and by the evening were on the line of theMonsMaubeuge road behind a line of outposts held by the 1st LondonRegtOn the 10th November the 1st Londons continued the advance precededby cavalry No serious opposition was encountered until the infantryhad passed through Harvengt when heavy machinegun fire from bothflanks held up the advance A squadron of 16th Lancers attempted toget through but failed The infantry then attacked and cleared theground entered Harmignies and held a line to the eastOrders were received that night that the 63rd Division would carry onthe advance as advance guard to the XXII Corps and the necessaryreliefs were carried out The artillery of the 56th Division remained    313in action and were just two miles south of the spot where BrigGenElkington was in action on the 23rd August 1914 at the battle ofMons Gen Hull on the other hand had actually held an outpost linebefore Harmignies with his battalion on the 22nd August and had movedto the north to hold a line from Obourg to Mons on the 23rd After thebattle the
