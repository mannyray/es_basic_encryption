from the beachThey have been gone so longNone too long sighed Nathalie Lawrence swinging lazily to and froin a hammock which was hung across one end of the veranda What aheaven it is without them I declare Helen she continuedaddressing her sister in aggrieved tone we do get a lot of thosechildren somehow or other For my part I cannot see why you let themstay about with us all the time when they are a thousand times betteroff with Mary and she gave a vindictive tug at a rope fastened tothe railing which sent the hammock back and forth with the utmostrapidityTake care Nat you will be out next and there will be a hubbubworse than the children would think of making in their wildestmomentsThe young girl who thus spoke laughed a low musical laugh and lookedup from her book with a pair of wideopen blue eyesNathalie as usual thinks only of herself said Helen with a frownas she walked awayI never can say one word about those children without raising Helensire She spoils them and she might as well admit itIn my short and uneventful career responded Jean smiling I havenot found that people are overfond of admitting anything least ofall their weaknesses I dont see how you can expect Helen to besuperior to all the rest of the worldyourself and myself includedNow imagine she continued tantalizingly if anyone insisted uponyour admitting your weakness for Mr ChurchOh keep quiet Jean you are too stupidDear dear cried Jean jumping up and closing her book of courseI am and that is my weakness so now we are quitsNathalie tossed her head as much as her position would permitJean Lawrence she said solemnly you bore meWhat a catastrophe Jean flung back her head with a merry laughGoodby dear you are the picture of injured innocenceJean come back cried Nathalie struggling to obtain an uprightposition I do think you are too bad Ah well some daythenbreaking into song     Some day some day some day I shall meet you           Love I know not when nor how     Love I know not when nor how Only this           Only this only this that once you loved me     Only this I love you nowRats called out a small voice from the lawn belowNathalie raised herself on her elbow and peered through the railingLarry I am thunderstruck What is the meaning of that weirdexpressionNathalie singing a love song cried Larry scampering about on thelawn Oh what funLarry called Helen coming out once more on to the veranda Whereare Willie and Gladys Why did you stay so long I have been worryingabout youOh theyre coming along Now dont you worry Helen cause we wasall right You dont need never to send Mary with us he addedeagerly cause we wouldnt get drownded nor nothing reallyJean strolled back from the other end of the veranda and put her handon Helens shoulderLarry love she said looking down at her little brother yourgrammar is something to be deploredA fleeting smile lit up Helens pale face and gentle brown eyesAh here come the little culprits she cried starting forwardGladys my precious baby I have been worried to death about youWhat naughty chicks to have staid so long Willie I can never trustyouWillie was a grave little fellow the eldest of the three childrenWhy Helen we werent gone long Gladys was good and so wasLarrythat is pretty he added deprecatingly The moment I saidCome on children we all started only Gladys she couldnt walkvery fast so Larry wouldnt wait for us Oh sighed Willie hisgrave little face in a pucker at the recollection I would ratherMary went along with Gladys another timeAnyhow I was awful good sister lisped little Gladys trying tofrown on Willie onlyOnly your short little legs would not carry you any quicker Is thatnot so darling Well since you were all good there is nothing toscold you aboutHelens faith is sublime laughed Jean in an aside to NathalieHelen took little Gladys in her arms and sat down in a large rockerwhich stood close to the front doorShe was a slender fraillooking girl Her soft brown hair wasarranged close to her head with the utmost simplicity and her ratherpale face would perhaps have been plain had it not been redeemed by apair of beautiful sad brown eyes She was the eldest of the Lawrencesand it seemed to her only a brief time since the Angel of Death hadtwice in one short year visited their home leaving them bereft offather and motherHer father had been a physician of undoubted skill a man of widelearning and great culture Had the lash of poverty given an incentiveto his somewhat lagging spirit he might have commanded the attentionand the admiration of his fellowmen but his was a nature of greatshyness and reserve and when his father died leaving him acomfortable fortune he had with an almost unconscious sigh ofrelief turned his back on ambition and withdrawn to the old homesteadin the sleepy little town of Hetherford content with a small countrypractice which left him undisturbed hours among his books and in hislaboratoryMrs Lawrences inclinations were thoroughly social but so unboundedwas her faith in her husbands judgment that it never occurred to herto complain of the narrowness and isolation of their life inHetherford As her girls grew older however she reproached herselfwith the thought that she was hardly doing them justice in thussecluding them from the advantages of contact with the great worldwhich lay beyond their own pretty village She appeased her conscienceby giving them occasional visits to town and one long happy summer inEurope which they had enjoyed to their hearts contentThe winter following this last delightful holiday Dr Lawrence hadbeen stricken with a fatal illness and after weeks of suffering hadpassed awayMrs Lawrence survived this blow but two months and at little Gladysbirth had turned to Helen with a weary heartbroken sighMy darling I am so lonelyyour father Take care of the littleonesthis wee lamb God bless you myHelen had sunk speechless at her mothers bedside until the sound ofa wailing cry brought her once more to herselfMy dear said gentle Aunt Helen leaning over her wont you takethe poor little baby Perhaps she will help to comfort youAnd Helen took her little sister in her arms and made her way intothe nursery where in two small cribs side by side lay her littlebrothers fast asleepJean and Nathalie stood by the nursery window looking out into thenight At Helens entrance they turned sharplyO Helen how is mamma Jean stopped short appalled at the change inher sisters faceHelen she cried a sharp ring of pain in her voice mamma is notYes JeanNathaliemamma is gone Oh what shall we do HelenmoanedMy poor children said Aunt Helen tenderly crossing the room andputting an arm around little Nathalie and clasping Jeans handtightly in hers your dear mamma is gone She was so sad and lonelywithout papa Oh darlings do not grieve but think of her as happyand at rest You Helen must learn to be a mother to these littlesisters and brothers and teach them all your dear mamma would havethem know And Jean and even little Nathalie too can helpAuntieHelens tears were falling fastI will do all I can Poorbaby she whispered and she kissed the soft little face which wasnestled in her arms and then she turned toward the cribs and lookedwith loving eyes at the sleeping children God bless them and helpmeSince that sad night six years had rolled by Nathalie was noweighteen Jean her elder by two years and Helens twentythirdbirthday was close at hand Larry and Willie were respectively eightand ten and little Gladys was fast outgrowing her babyhoodAunt Helen Mrs Dennis had since Mrs Lawrences death made herpermanent home with her nieces and nephews She was a sweet gentlewoman a widow and childless and her lonely life had been thusgladdened by the love of this household of happygolucky childrenShe had always been delicate and during the past few years had becomeso great an invalid that she rarely left her roomThus Helen Lawrence had been obliged to assume unusual cares andresponsibilities for so young a girl and these were not without theireffect on her mind and characterFor years the manor house of Hetherford had been in the possession ofthe Lawrences and no family in the town was better known or moreuniversally loved The manor itself was a charming old parkstretching out far enough to make it no small walk to compass itsgrounds Grand old trees shaded the wellkept lawns and prettygraveled paths lined with boxwood led hither and thitherThe house was oldfashioned in the extreme large square andcommodious A broad veranda ran around three sides of it and acrossthe front there was an upper balcony which in the season wascovered with trailing vines of roses honeysuckles and passionflowers During the warm summer days this was a favorite retreat ofthe girls A few rugs were thrown down comfortable wicker chairs werescattered here and there and on the low round table in the centerthere was always a motley collection of books writing materials andworkbaskets Through occasional openings in the vines were revealedpretty vistas of lawn and flowering rosebeds beyond which stretchedthe blue waters of the sound sparkling in the sunshine as if strewnwith a thousand jewels It was indeed an Arcadian spotWithin doors everything was equally oldfashioned and comfortableOpening on to the broad hall which ran through the middle of thehouse were four large airy rooms simply but substantially furnishedand with an unmistakable air of being lived in Upstairs in additionto the rooms occupied by the family each one of which was bright andcheery and clearly revealed the individuality of its occupant wereseveral guest chambers with heavy fourpost bedsteads and quaintmahogany dressingtables and during the summer season these wererarely untenanted for the Lawrences hospitality was as oldfashionedas their homeQuiet Hetherford was almost unknown as a summer resort but the fewpeople who had once found their way there came again and again andwith them all the Lawrences were on intimate and friendly terms Itwas not strange that young men came but rarely to this outofthewaylittle village but a colony of girls thrived and were happy therehappier perhaps for this very lack of the masculine element Thegirls often laughed merrily over it and no one of them seemed to takeit very much to heart save pretty little darkeyed Emily Varian whospent her summers with her uncle Dr Evelyn Birdsall thePresbyterian ministerIt is deplorable she sighed and if the girls were not selfishlylazy they could quite easily get some men to come out here Certainlytown is not so far off as to make us quite out of the world It isnothing but stupid nonsense and vanity on the girls part They thinkit is something fine and independent never to see anything of men Formy part I should think they would be ashamed of itThere was one girl who always laughed goodhumoredly at Emilysgrumbling and she was none other than charming Eleanor Hill Howevershe had less cause to complain for while Emily went from her winterhome in one little country town to sleepier Hetherford for the summermonths Miss Hill for more than half of every year led the gayest oflives in New York When June came with its warm sunshine and longdays she and her mother gladly turned their face toward prettydreamy Hetherford to them the dearest spot in the worldMollie Andrews said that for her part she didnt care Taking it allin all she did not see but that they had a pretty good time TheAndrews had been coming to Hetherford for years and were all deeplyattached to the place Mollies handsome scatterbrained brother Dickhad set the seal of his approval on their choice of a summer resortand thenceforth Mollie would have deemed it nothing short of heresy tocall the place stupid To be sure Dick rarely turned up oftener thanonce a week but then her cousin Clifford Archer nicknamed the fatalbeauty was wont to put in an appearance for a few days frequentlywith his great chum Wendell Churchill whose yacht was quite afamiliar object in Hetherford HarborIt is perfectly absurd of Emily Mollie would end with a toss ofher headEmily always looked scornful and Nan Birdsall happygolucky Nanwho rarely went away from Hetherford would laugh gleefullyPoor Em she exclaimed one evening after one of her cousinstirades you are mancrazy Never mind dear you wait I know athing or two and by and by when my ship comes in looking around atthe girls with a mischievous twinkle in her eye you will besurprised Perhaps we will have more men here than we have bargainedforWhat do you mean Nan they cried in chorus but not a bit ofsatisfaction would Nan give themThe parsonage adjoined the manor and an opening in the hedge madeintercourse between the two families an easy matter Just across theroad was the inn where all the summer visitors stayed and a quainterretreat could not be imagined They formed only a small circle ofpeople but many were the happy times they had togetherCHAPTER IINANS SHIP ARRIVESI wonder why we couldnt have a swim this morning Jean Nathaliestood before her mirror arranging her pretty brown tresses which inspite of vigorous efforts with brush and comb would curl and refuseto be orderly Of course Aunt Helen will say it is too early in theseasonWell I think that is absurd It is warm enough Africs sunnyclime is not a circumstance to it Look out Jean at the sunlight onthe lawn When it has that pinkish tinge you may be sure its hotJean peeped through the halfopen shuttersOh what a sweet day Yes it is going to be hot and unless AuntHelen objects seriously we will surely go inShe crossed the room and opening the wardrobe door took out a prettystriped cotton gown Warm enough for this isnt itNathalie noddedIn a few minutes more the girls were both in the dining room Helenand the children were already at breakfastHow late you are cried Helen looking up from an open letter Iwish youNever mind dear interrupted Nathalie It will all be the same ahundred years henceOh yes I suppose so sighed Helen Gladys dont beat on thetable with your spoon The noise is distractingAnd although your tones are dulcet my love suppose you give us thatlittle song after breakfast and Jean slipped into her place at herlittle sisters sideGladys turned and threw her arms around herI didnt see you come in JeanieThat is because you have not eyes in the back of your head petOf course I havent Nobody has cept fairies and princesses Ispose and Gladys straightened herself up and in so doingoverturned her glass of milk into her lapGladys cried Helen sharply look at your nice clean frock It isa shameThe little girls lips trembled and her bright blue eye overflowedwith tearsYou dont spose I did it apurposefor nothingNo no dear Of course not Dont cry I didnt mean to scold youThere get down and run up to Mary like a good little girl and haveyour frock changed for the sight of tears always put an end toHelens best efforts at severityBut Gladys feelings had been hurt and now that she was mistress ofthe situation she had no intention of drying her eyesI think you were unkind Helen she began plaintivelyDont be a baby Gladys interposed Nathalie irritably I declareI think it a perfect nuisance to have our breakfast spoiled in thisway If you cant behave you had better have yours in the nurseryThe childs tears were about to begin afresh when a pleasant voice washeard at the doorGoodmorning Can I come in And without awaiting permission MissHill crossed the room In her pretty flannel gown and garden hat shemade a very pleasing picture How are you puss And she stooped andkissed little Gladys tearstained cheek smiling meanwhile at thegirls as she divined the situationAll right said the little girl her face brightening perceptiblyfor she dearly loved Miss HillHelen here is a rose said Eleanor and when you smell it you willrealize that June is hereHelen smiled her thanksWell Eleanor what started you so early asked Jean as shebuttered her rollEarly You girls dont know what early means Why it is after nineand I had my breakfast a good hour agoHorror shuddered Nathalie The very thought is painThey are spoiled spoke Helen and even I am getting into badhabits I simply gave up struggling and set the breakfast hour a halfhour later with the desperate hope that it might bring them down ontimeGirls you ought to be ashamed said Eleanor with wellfeignedreproach in her toneWhat nonsense You would do exactly the same yourself if Mrs Moffinswere not such a disciplinarian You cant make me think you are sosuperior laughed NathalieHelen rose and pushing open the blind door stepped out on theveranda It was a beautiful June morning bright and sunshiny The airwas soft and warm and the gentle south wind felt like a caress Thefragrance of roses and honeysuckles was almost intoxicating Every nowand then the delicious stillness was broken by the soft plaintive songof a bird The old manor looked more beautiful than ever to Helen wholoved every nook and cranny of it She stood for a moment shading hereyes with her hand from the sunWhat a pretty day she murmured to herself Oh I wish butthen a voice called her and she went back into the houseHelen said Jean coming out from the dining room ask Auntie if wecan go in bathing It is so warm and we are wild to go inVery well nodded Helen as she went upstairsMrs Dennis was in her chair by the window with her breakfast tray ona small table at her sideGoodmorning darling she said cheerily Where did these deliciousstrawberries come from glancing at the pretty cutglass dish whichwas filled with themThey are the first out of the garden Auntie and I was determinedthat no one should have them but your own dear selfThank you my dear it was just like you to think of Auntie first Ishall indeed enjoy themDo please and oh Auntie the girls want to go bathing today Areyou willing they shouldI am afraid the water will be coldWell we have had a good deal of warm weather and I think it cantbe very frigid I suppose we might as well say yes AuntieOf course replied Aunt Helen laughingly Past experience hastaught us that when Jean and Nathalie have set their hearts on athing we might as well surrender at once You wont go in dearNo indeed and Helen shivered at the idea I must go and tell thegirls for they will want to knowWhen the roomy buckboard came to the door Nathalie jumped into thefront seat and gathered up the reinsHurry and get in girls she called The horses are very fresh thismorning and in a moment more they were bowling down the avenueStop at the inn Nat said Jean and we will get the letters andask Mollie to go down to the beach with usAs they pulled up before the inn Mollie Andrews came running out onto the porch with a package of letters in her handDont get out Jean I have your mail Have you got room enough formeCertainly Jump right in cried Nathalie The tide is just rightnow so we must hurry Oh isnt this jolly I love the delicioussense of excitement one always feels at the first swim of the seasonSay Moll will you go inI dont know Yes I think I willIt was quite a pretty scene this bright June morning down on thelittle stretch of sands which Hetherford dignified by the name of TheBeachLittle children were digging in the sand and filling their pails andsome of the small boys were running up and down now in the water andnow out The girls were in a group in front of the bathing houses allchattering at once and discussing the momentous question as towhether to make the plunge or notIn a brief time Jean and Nathalie were swimming far out and Molliecame creeping timidly to the waters edgeOh how I dread it she laughedNonsense Moll go ahead It will do you goodMollie walked off and Helen and Eleanor who had found a shelterednook watched the bathers for a while in silence By and by Helensgaze strayed from the bathers to the stretch of blue water beyond anda slightly troubled look crept into her eyes A sudden deep sighrecalled Eleanors thoughts to her companionWhy Helen what world of melancholy does that sigh proclaimOh I dont know evasively I am lowspirited this morningsomehow or otherCant you tell me the reason dearHelen did not answer and for a moment Eleanor watched her closelySomething in the delicate face and in the eyes in which of late ashadow always lurked touched herI would love your confidence Helen she said at last but unlessyou can give it to me freely I would not wish to ask it of youHelen stirred uneasilyAh well for a moment I thought to speak to you of somethingtroublesome but be glad dear that I have changed my mind I amgoing to speak of something pleasant instead Do you remember myfriend Miss Stuart She has visited me several times but always inthe winterOh yes I remember Jeans writing me about herHelen turned a questioning glance on Eleanor but the girlsexpression was perfectly noncommittalYes Well she is coming here to visit me later The time is not setas yet but I hope it will be early next monthIndeed How nice But Helen I thought she was very gay and devotedto society What will she do in this colony of girls with scarcely aman to say a pretty thing to herI dont know replied Helen a shade of annoyance crossing her faceI think perhaps the girls may be mistaken about her I feel quitesure she will be happy hereJust then Nan Birdsall came rushing down over the sands warm butradiantGoing in Nan called Eleanor in greetingNo indeed breathlessly I hate the water more than a cat doesand Nan dropped down on the sand at Eleanors side and taking offher hat fanned her flushed faceWhere is Em this morning queried HelenWhat a superfluous question laughed Nan Dont you see that theSylph is in the harbor Of course Em has Mr Churchill in towHow will Nathalie like that asked Eleanor with an amused smileOh Nat wont care replied Nan picking up a pebble and sending itskimming across the water She is far too sensibleLook over your shoulder Nan and see your prediction verified andsurely enough strolling across the beach in their direction cameEmily Varian with Wendell Churchill at her sideIsnt Em in her element said Nan lowering her voiceNothing could have been more characteristic than the welcome the threegirls gave Mr Churchill Into Eleanor Hills courteous greeting wasthrown just enough of personal interest as to be slightly flatteringHelens How do you do was both shy and reserved and Nan just noddedindifferently and continued her occupation of skipping stonesWe ought to be going home announced Helen presentlyI wonder if the girls are not ready yet Oh yes there they comeas the three girls came down from the bathing house and joined thelittle group Suddenly Nan dropped her pebbles and sprang to her feetwith an exclamationOh girls what fun My ship has come in at lastWhy Nan are you going out of your mind cried Jean What shipLook girls look Dont you see that big schooner just rounding thepointYes but what of itWhy thats the U S Coast Survey schooner Vortex and shes goingto be stationed here for a long time and Dick knows all the officersaboard How is that for a piece of newsThis must be your secret laughed EleanorOf course and didnt I keep it well Dick told me weeks ago thatthey were comingI say it is jolly We will have some fun wont we It was Nathaliewho spokeIt is a perfect godsend declared Emily Varian solemnly Nan yoursecret is a success and I congratulate youI wonder ruminated Jean who the men are and whether we willreally like themTime will tell spoke Helen a bit indifferently Come girls wemust be going Here is the carriageAlmost every evening the young people gathered together on theLawrences broad veranda and tonight was no exception to the ruleWhen the girls strolled out from the dining room they found Nan andEmily sitting on the stepsWhy we never heard you at all said Jean You must have come overthe lawn likeoh dear I cant think of a comparison The night istoo warm for one to exert ones brain unnecessarilyNathalie seated herself on the railingHere come Eleanor and Wendell ChurchillAh laughed Jean teasingly Her sister looked around at her withheightened colorDont be silly JeanDo you know I have hardly seen you today Miss Nathalie saidChurchill finding a place on the railing at her side Where have youkept yourselfEverywhereanywhere I have not been hard to findNathalies eyes were smiling wickedly into his and his gave her backa smileNow let me explain he beganOh dont let me put you to any unnecessary trouble she interruptedwith mock formalityYou are very cruel tonight said Churchill laughing By the wayDick and I went down to the Vortex this afternoon and there aresome awfully good fellows aboard I hope you girls will give them agood timeIt seems to me that the responsibility ought to rest with theminterposed Eleanor HillOtherwise we should feel absolutely overwhelmed said Nan comicallyHere comes Dick now exclaimed Nathalie and he has a strange manwith himIn a moment more Dick Andrews gained the veranda and introduced hisfriend Beverly Dudley of the VortexIt was Jean who came forward and extending her hand bade himwelcomeAh Mr Dudley I fear you will feel yourself overwhelmed with such abevy of girls but let me help you This is my sister Nathaliemyfriends Miss Hill Miss Birdsall and Miss Varian Unfortunately myelder sister is not here to receive you She will join us presentlyEmily cant you make room for Mr Dudley on the settle she addedglancing about herEmily smiled radiantly and Dudley who seemed to be a charming youthmade his way to her sideLeaving Nathalie and Em each happy in a ttette the other girlsformed a circle of which jolly Dick was the center and muchgoodnatured chaffing and lighthearted laughter were in orderAfter a while Helen appeared in the doorway with two mandolins in herhandsWhat a good idea exclaimed Eleanor enthusiastically Now we canhave some singingI cant very well shake hands Mr Dudley said Helen in responseto Jeans introductionLet me relieve you Miss LawrenceThanks Will you give this mandolin to my sister NathalieThey all joined in a song and their voices with the mandolinaccompaniment sounded wondrously sweet in the soft night airIt was growing late when Nan at last jumped upI am sorry to break up the party but Emily and I must be goingFather will have the town crier out pretty soonThere was a general move and Mr Dudley crossed to Helens sideI have had a charming evening Miss Lawrence I hope you will honorus with your presence on the Vortex very soon He spoke with thesoft drawl peculiar to SouthernersIt will be a great pleasure and indeed we willWont you let me walk home with you Miss Varian he asked It israther late for you to go aloneEmilys answer was lost in a merry peal of laughter from NanMr Dudley evidently appreciates the dangers lurking in that desolatestretch of lawn between here and the parsonage she said withgoodnatured sarcasmThe girls joined in a general laugh in spite of themselves but Emilyfrowned portentouslyAfter goodnight had been said all around and Helen found herselfalone in her room she took out from between the leaves of a book theletter she had received in the morning As she reread it she glancedup from time to time at a likeness which stood on the table close athand It was the face of a very beautiful womana face delicate ovalin shape with straight eyebrows from under which looked out a pairof eyes with a world of witchery in their depths the whole crowned bya halo of soft hairHelen dropped the letter in her lap and folding her hands over itfell into a deep reverie Rousing herself at last she slowly crossedthe room and opened a little drawer in her writing desk Therehidden among some papers lay another photographa mans face thistime As she looked at it steadily a heavy sigh escaped her lips forit seemed to her that the grave eyes looked at her reproachfully Witha halfimpatient exclamation she tossed it back into its hidingplaceand closed the drawer sharply and not until sleep claimed her didthese two faces fade entirely from her mental visionCHAPTER IIIA LEAF FROM HELENS PASTMany years before the opening of this story the Lawrence childrencounted among their dearest friends a certain pleasantfaced sturdylittle chap Guy Appleton by name who never considered a day quitecomplete unless at least a part of it was spent at the hospitablemanor His own pretty home Rose Cottage lay only a stones throwaway and there the little Lawrence girls passed many a happy hourMrs Appleton and Mrs Lawrence had been schoolgirls together and theflight of years had but strengthened their friendship Mrs Appletonwas delighted that her shy little son had found such pleasantcompanions and in every way encouraged his intercourse with them TheLawrences were all dear to Guys boyish heart but none held quite thesame place as Helen She had been especially kind and friendly to himand for her his affection was particularly deep and adoringThe years as they rolled by served but to increase his love for hislittle playmate and from his allegiance to her he never swerved Whenhis college days were over and he was about to sail for Europe on anextended tour he found it impossible to say farewell withoutspeaking to her of the subject which lay nearest his heartHelen was very young and inexperienced and these were the first wordsof love to which she had ever listened Her tender heart was deeplytouched and Guy went away gladdened by her shy expression of sorrowat his departure and by the whispered Yes that her lips spokefalteringlyHelen had accepted her youthful lover and many were the rejoicingsamong the small Hetherford circle over what they termed Helensengagement although the girl herself looked a little grave over soserious a term At the manor the new relationship was accepted gladlyfor it seemed only a fitting ending to Guys long friendship in theirfamilyThree years slipped by years in which Guy bent every energy to thestudy of architecture which he had chosen as his profession He haddecided talent and by continued assiduity was making a name forhimself among his colleaguesLittle change had taken place in Hetherford except such as the flightof time must necessarily bring Helen was now quite a woman with apretty air of gravity which the new cares had lent to herWhen finally one crisp October day Guy walked in upon them his facebronzed by the recent ocean trip his slender figure grown broad andstrong his blue eyes beaming with happiness he was welcomed with thegreatest warmth of affection and as they sat about the cracklingflames in the manor hall his long absence seemed almost a dreamIt was during the following winter that Helen had her firstmisgivings as to her real feeling for Guy Indeed sometimes herengagement oppressed her strangely and she was assailed by anoverwhelming longing to be freeWomen are indeed incomprehensible and when the largess of their loveis not given it is rare save through some sharp lesson that theyappreciate to the full the men whose hearts they possess In thisHelen was perhaps in nowise different from the rest of her sex Bethis as it may Guys unchanging love and devotion sometimes weariedher and failed to call forth an answering love in her own heart Yetthe months glided by and she had not the courage to tell her loverthe truth She was not always successful in hiding it from himhowever and once or twice a faint suspicion of her indifference cameto himThe summer came and went and almost a year had drifted by since hisreturn Guy finally broached the subject of marriageAt his first words Helen was filled with dismay and as she listenedwith downbent head and averted eyes Guy was suddenly conscious of agreat lack in her love for him and a sense of foreboding swept overhim To his long and pleading request that a time might be set fortheir marriage Helen put forth the childrens claim upon her andwhen he gently urged her to reconsider her determination she answeredhim so sharply and curtly that he yielded convinced that it would beunwise to press the matter any furtherHelens lips had almost formed the words Guy I do not love you as Ishould but her lovers face pale with grief at her all too evidentreluctance robbed her of the needful courageGuy was not a man of half measures and having accepted Helensdecision resolutely put out of his mind his painful doubts andtrusted to the future to strengthen her love for him She was greatlytouched by his generosity and half ashamed of the stand she had takenand now that the question of marriage was indefinitely postponedpersuaded herself that she was deeply attached to him and that itwould have been both cruel and unwise to have broken her engagementIn September Guy took his vacation and his mother having volunteeredto go to the mountains with him he induced Helen to accompany themShe had many qualms of conscience at leaving the children but theinvitation was a tempting one and she had not the heart to disappointher lover a second time So after strict injunctions to Mary andurgent entreaties to Jean and Nathalie she started offIt was a delightful holiday for all three Mrs Appleton who had nothought for anyone but her son was overjoyed to see him in such highspirits for of late she had thought him both sad and depressed andGuy felt that his happiness was quite complete for never had he hadHelen so much to himself and never had she been so franklyaffectionate and sweet with him The days glided by like a dream evento Helen She had thrust all worry and anxiety from her and enteredwith eager interest and zest into all the plans for their pleasantjourneyings If now and then she found herself a bit wearied by Guysunceasing attentions she strenuously hid the fact from him and calledherself strictly to account for the unworthy thoughtIt was at a hotel on the borders of a beautiful lake that Helen firstsaw Lillian Stuart One morning Guy had gone off fishing and as MrsAppleton was writing letters in the seclusion of her room Helen tookher book and wandered out into the grounds in search of a cool shadyspot where she could read in peace Coming at length upon a retirednook she found herself forestalled for comfortably ensconced underthe shade of a great willow was a woman so beautiful that as Helencaught sight of her she could scarce repress an exclamation The girllooked up and their eyes met Helen shyly dropped hers and passedquickly on but that brief glimpse left a vivid impression upon hermind of a wellpoised head crowned with the most wonderful auburnhair of a face dazzlingly fair and a pair of deep violet eyesAll day long Helens thoughts reverted to this vision and thatafternoon when Guy returned from his fishing she gave him a glowingdescription of her encounterJust before dinner while they were standing together in the corridorthe girl came toward them on her way to the dining room Helen laidher hand impulsively on her lovers armPlease look Guy she whispered Here she comes Isnt shebeautiful Why Guy excitedly do you know her She is bowing toyouIs that the woman you mean he asked when he had gravely returnedher bowWhy yes Where did you ever know herI met her at Baden when I was over thereHow strange said Helen musingly Why did you never tell me aboutherBecause I never liked her he replied with decision and I trustyou and she will not meetA curiously unaccountable feeling of resentment swept across HelenI dont suppose there is much chance of it she returned coldlyIt is the unexpected that happens for one afternoon only a few dayslater as Helen stood talking with some friends on the broad hotelveranda Miss Stuart joined the group and before Helen had hardlyappreciated the situation an introduction had ensuedIn spite of Guys protests a friendship sprang up between the twogirls It seemed to him that there was something almost pointed in theway Helen ignored his request and followed up this acquaintance towhich he had so strenuously objected Helen was not only fascinatedand charmed by Miss Stuarts meteorlike brilliance but feltmoreover the keenest annoyance at the masterful way in which Guy hadlaid his injunctions upon her He had maintained a strict reticenceconcerning his reasons giving her no further explanation than thatthe friendship ran counter to his wishes Helens defiance wasaroused and perhaps a growing sense of ennui in her lovers societyincreased the temptation to welcome eagerly any new interestMeanwhile Miss Stuart had a welldefined motive in trying to secureHelens friendship and an even stronger desire to lessen Guysinfluence with the girl Whatever her past acquaintance with Guy hadbeen it would have been apparent to anyone less easily deceived thanHelen that she bore him no good willThe rest of the holiday time which had begun so happily was spoiledfor Guy and he was relieved when at length their faces were turnedtoward home feeling sure that a separation from Miss Stuart was allthat was necessary to awaken Helens loyalty to him and to put an endto what he considered a most unfortunate episode in the girls lifeTo his deep sorrow their return did not accomplish his expectationsfor not only had a correspondence been begun between the girls butHelens whole bearing toward him changed completely and her mannerwas both cold and distant Finally one evening she came to him andafter a few preliminaries announced her intention of visiting MissStuart at her home in town This brief announcement aroused Guysquick temper and before he realized what had happened bitter wordshad been spoken and Helen had swept out of the roomThe following day she left for town When a week had passed without aline from her Guy could endure it no longer and sought an interviewbattling with his indignation at the thought that it must take placeunder Miss Stuarts roofMany a time afterward he tried to recall the exact words that werespoken on that memorable occasion but everything seemed unreal tohim save Helens face pale with the determination not to accede tohis wishes Finally he could recall asking her if she desired herfreedom Alas poor Guy The quick spontaneity of her responseshattered his last hopeAh yes Guy please We will be so much better friends thenFriends he echoed bitterly after all these yearsHelen put her hand on his shoulder but he gently pushed her from himIt is as well I should know the truth now as later You do not loveme Helen There is nothing left now but for us to partWhen he was leaving a sudden recollection came to him of the cause ofall this unhappiness and crushing down his own bitterness heendeavored in quiet and carefully chosen words to dissuade her from afriendship which he feared she would rue but she maintained an almostunbroken silence and the expression of her face told him that hiswarning was of no avail So they partedGuy was more than justified in his distrust of Lillian Stuart Had hebeen a man of less delicate sense of honor he could have rightedhimself in Helens eyes by simply relating to her some incontrovertiblefacts but the circumstances which had given him his knowledge sealedhis lipsWhile at college the name Lillian Stuart had grown familiar to himthrough hearing her praises sounded by his chum Nelson Leonard Theyear after their graduation they ran across each other at Baden andtheir college friendship was resumed Guy was not long in discoveringthat there was something radically wrong with his friend and thecause which all Baden apparently understood was soon made clear tohimAmong the most noted people frequenting Baden at this time were aMrs OgdenStuart and her beautiful daughter It had been understoodon their arrival that Miss Stuart was engaged to the goodlookingAmerican Mr Leonard who was traveling in their party This facthowever did not seem to stand in the way of her flirting openly withevery eligible man in the place nor prevent her from receiving theirconstant homage Leonard was evidently wretched and there was a touchof recklessness in his manner which Guy felt boded no good to a manof his highly strung sensitive nature For a week after Guys arrivalthings drifted on but there was something in the air that seemed toforetell a crisis Guy had been presented to Miss Stuart but in spiteof her beauty and fascination found nothing in her to like or respectThis Miss Stuart felt instinctively and as she was accustomed toadmiration it stung her into a desire to win something more thanindifference from Leonards friend Her efforts were totallyunsuccessful and as her treatment of her lover became less and lessloyal Guy withdrew altogether from her society showing her nofurther courtesy than an occasional bow of recognition In themeantime Miss Stuarts latest affair with a certain Frenchman ofunenviable reputation was giving Baden food for gossip and keeping iton the qui vive for a scandalLate one afternoon while Guy sat on the veranda reading letters fromhome Miss Stuart and Leonard passed him The girls face wore amocking smile her eyes a taunt Leonard was white as death and hislips twitched piteously Guys own face grew stern as he looked up atthem and when Miss Stuart threw him a careless word in salutation hecould scarcely frame a civil replyThat evening Leonard went to Guys room and flinging himself down ina chair gave voice for the first time to his miseryI tell you Appleton he exclaimed with a hard laugh I shallthrow up the game pretty soon I may be a coward but it takes morecourage than I have to face this thing any longerGuy was more startled than he cared to reveal by his friendspassionate despairing vehemence and he made an effort to treat thematter lightly and to divert Leonards thoughts but his efforts werenot crowned with success When Leonard had left him he paced up anddown the room revolving in his mind what step he should take Atlength he determined to go to Miss Stuart and appeal to her hopingthat so direct a course would result favorablyHe began the interview awkwardly feeling that his presumption wasalmost unwarrantable but when she met his earnest plea for his friendfirst with indifference and then with undisguised amusement he foundhis anger risingI do not think you can realize Leonards condition of mind MissStuart he said darkly If you would only put an end to this oncefor all I am sure that he is man enough to go away from you and tryto live down his disappointment but he has a peculiarly excitable andsensitive temperament and if you continue to torture him in this wayI fear you will have his death at your doorI am sorry to say she replied lightly that our friend is a foolnow looking up at him with a glance strangely deep and subtle ifhe were half the man you areI have nothing further to say Guy interrupted flushing withindignation and disgust and without another word he abruptly leftherTwo days later all Baden was shocked by the startling news that youngNelson Leonard had accidentally shot himself and was lying at thepoint of deathThose melancholy hours of watching by Leonards bedside in thatdreary hotel room lived in Guys memory When the doctors sadverdict was pronounced the dying man pleaded to be left alone withhis friendAh dear old fellow he said gently when they were alone prettywell donefor an accident Forgive me he murmured as he caught asharp look of pain in Guys face Forgive his voice falteredand his head fell wearily back on the pillowThen the poor boys mind wandered and Lillian Stuarts name wasconstantly on his lips In broken halting sentences a pitiful storyof deception and disappointment was revealed to Guya story whichwould be sacred to him to his lifes end and as he listened hiswhole soul revolted against the woman who had so willfully trifledwith this mans tender loyal heart Before morning dawned NelsonLeonards eyes had closed forever on a life which he had found toodifficult for him When the sad affair was over Guy would fain haveleft Baden at once but he was obliged to await there the arrival ofLeonards family from AmericaIn the days that ensued Lillian Stuart was markedly subdued but ifshe had any suspicion of the real truth concerning Leonards death shenever betrayed it by word or look She did all in her power toovercome Guys aversion for her but he sternly repulsed her Toattempt conciliation was a new rle for Miss Stuart and his colddisregard of all her efforts was the severest wound her vanity hadever receivedSuch a slight is not readily forgiven or forgotten by a woman of hertype So when Guy Appleton once more crossed her path and she foundin his deep love for Helen his vulnerable point she felt that herday of triumph had comeIt had been an easy task to secure Helens friendship and then to souse her influence with the girl as to effect the annulling of theengagement Miss Stuart knew Guys nature well enough to feel almostsure that however sorely he might be tempted he would probably neverbetray his knowledge of that unpleasant episode in her past sotrading on the mans very uprightness she revenged herself for thebitter sting of wounded vanity that rankled in her memoryHer wellplanned scheme had been marvelously successful but oneunlookedfor element had entered into it for Helens simplicity andpurity of nature her lack of vanity coquetry or duplicity aboveall her entire confidence and trust had touched a tender chord inthe heart of this cold and worldly woman and were in themselves apower so great she felt herself held by them Could she have foreseenthe future she would perhaps have struggled against this mostdisturbing elementGuys return to Hetherford with the announcement that his engagementwas at an end and that he was going immediately abroad created quitea ferment among the good people at the manor and Rose Cottage andmany were their fruitless conjectures as to the cause of Helenssudden change of feeling Across at the parsonage happygolucky Nanpuckered up her jolly face pondered long over this vexatiousquestion and hit at last upon the correct solution of it but wiselykept her own counselMrs Appleton took her sons disappointment very much to heart andwhen Helen came home again Rose Cottage was closed and its occupantsonce more gone abroad When the buckboard rolled by the desertedlittle place Helen drew her breath sharply then catching Jeansreproachful eyes upon her began hurriedly to speak of other thingsThe Lawrences frankly avowed to her their regret and disappointmentbut not one word of explanation did the girl vouchsafe to them soafter a little they accepted the inevitable and Guys name was nolonger spoken among themAnd thus it was that of the Lawrence girls Helen alone had the prouddistinction of having had a genuine love affair the memory of whichhowever was tinged with deep regret and caused her naught but painPerhaps she felt intuitively that she had done wrong What was apleasant friendship compared to the love of a true mans heart Yetthe thought of a marriage with Guy was out of the questionSo the foolish girl reasoned Time brings many changes however andperhaps what once seemed to Helen a catastrophe may one day seem toopen the very gates of ParadiseAnd now that we have taken a leaf from Helens past let us resume ourwayCHAPTER IVA SAIL ON THE CYCLONEThey have hired the dear old Cyclone Helen because the menthought the wind was bound to be light today and we would have somuch more sport in a small boat than on the VortexNathalie stood in the doorway gesticulating eagerly with her slenderbrown hands Her pretty face was quite flushed with excitement andher hurried words tripped over each other in their anxiety to bespokenYou see we must make haste for Dick says we must be at the dock ateleven or we wont catch the tideBut what about luncheon interposed Helen quietlyA comical expression of dismay crossed Nathalies faceOh dear I suppose you will want to kill us but Jean and I in asudden fit of enthusiasm said we would attend to that and not onething have we done yetDid you think to provide any cold meat for sandwiches demanded theyoung housekeeperOh yes there are three stout chickens some cold corned beef and abit of ham bone as Bridget puts it gracing your larderWell we havent a moment to spare so call Jean and let us getright to workThe pile of sandwiches grew rapidly under the girls deft hands andlittle Larry wandering in from the veranda looked longingly at theseinteresting preparationsWish I could go with you he ventured with sudden courageDont speak of it replied Helen emphatically as she ran out of theroom to get a fresh supply of breadGuess youll all be drownded anyway and Larry eyed them with asuperior and triumphant mienThats right my cheerful little brother laughed Jean Always lookon the bright side of thingsNow when shall we tell Aunt Helen we will be back asked Nathalieas they were fitting the cover down on the wellfilled hamperNot later than five I should thinkDont lets commit ourselves Helen suggested Jean It is such abore and we will be troubling about it all the afternoonWe must be home by five I am not willing to leave the children anylonger than thatPerhaps you can manage the wind to suit your own purposes You knowit generally plays more or less of a part in sailing and Jean gave avicious tug at the last unfastened strapDont be impertinent Jean Nathalie called out as she ran swiftlyupstairs Never mind Helen her youth is her only excuseAll the same we shall be home on time if possible dearieJean laughed goodhumoredlyI am always disagreeable she admitted when anyone speaks withdecision I dont know why but it sets my teeth on edgeDudley met them at the wharf with the cutter from the Vortex andsoon they were pulling swiftly out to the Cyclones mooring As theyrounded the stern of the old oyster sloop a young man was seenstanding at the wheel his slender figure held firmly erect one handshading his eyes as he scanned the blue waters of the soundWho is that whispered MollieUp oars cried Dudley intent on bringing the cutter up in goodform and in a moment more they were clambering up the gangsteps andMollies question went unansweredHullo Farr called Dick cheerfully and thus addressed LieutenantFarr left the wheel and moved leisurely forwardYou will have to individualize for yourself old fellow for it wouldbe impossible for me to name all these charming peopleTime enough spoke Farr in a wellmodulated voice as he raised hiscap and glanced at the group before himCome let us get off he said turning abruptly to the men and soonthe Cyclone was sailing lazily away before a light breezeHow delightful sighed Eleanor Hill as she settled herselfcomfortably to windward This is my idea of blissFarr paused an instant on his way aft and glanced interestedly at thegirls earnest face then proceeded to his place at the wheelFor pitys sake let somebody go and talk to that man said Jeandropping her voiceI fancy he doesnt care much about it replied Eleanor quietlyYou go Em Mollie suggestedCertainly and nothing daunted Emily started upWho doubted her willingness laughed Nan saucilyEleanor shook her head at the speakerDick threw himself down in the midst of the group of girls and kept upan incessant chatterOne voice was lacking in the general interchange of nonsense fortoday Jean Lawrence who was usually the merriest of them all foundher interest flagging strangely Sitting somewhat apart from theothers her eyes wandered persistently to where Farr was courteouslyand patiently initiating Emily Varian into the art of steering Therewas something about the man that caught her attention and held italmost against her will She noted with what an air of distinction hisrough yachting flannels were worn and how beautifully shaped were thelong slender hands which moved so lazily yet with such a suggestionof strength His cap was drawn down over his face so that only thelines of a wellmolded mouth and chin were revealed and Jean foundherself waiting with almost childish interest for a glimpse of theeyes so tantalizingly hid from view A sudden shout of boisterouslaughter from Dick brought her sharply to herself and with a keensense of shame and a passionate hope that her defection might havepassed unnoticed she turned and plunged into the conversationLet us have some songs girls suggested Eleanor We are gettingvery much demoralized and I dont know what that strange man willthink of usOh if I were a little bird how happy I would be began Jean withmore energy than correctnessHold on Jeanie interrupted Nathalie catching up her mandolinthe other words have lots more flavor     Oh the first that came acourting was little Tommy Green     The finest young man that ever was seen     But the words of my grandmother ran in my head     And I would not listen to a word that he saidThere that will do Nathalie interposed Helen with decisionNot at all cried Jean     Says I to myself there must be some mistake     What a great fuss these old folks make     If the boys and the girls had all been so afraid     Why grandma herself would have been an old maidJean sang the foolish words recklessly and when she had finished shota halfdefiant glance from under her long lashes in Farrs directionHis eyes met hers with a long steady look Somewhat disconcertedJean flushed hotly and turned hurriedly awayThat was a daisy Jean and Dick roared with laughterWhen the merriment had subsided a littleFarr said Dudley rising and making his way out of the circle Ithink you have had your turn at the wheel Suppose I take your placefor a whileI hope you are not very much bored Mr Farr ventured Jean shylyQuite the reversemuch entertained he replied quietlyJean wondered if there were a touch of sarcasm in this reply but hisface was impenetrableCharming accent he has smiled Eleanor in an aside to NanI wonder where he got it dont youHave you lived very much abroad Mr Farr queried Eleanor turningpolitely to himAnd why do you askWhy your accent is so unAmericanA broad smile crossed Dudleys face as he caught Miss Hills words Itamused him not a little to hear reticent Farr thus catechizedWhere are you from asked Nathalie coming to the front in her usualoutspoken fashionFarr glanced at her and then after an instants hesitation answeredlanguidlyFrom New JerseyAt this the little group throwing manners to the winds burst intomerry laughterDoesnt look a bit like a mosquito said Nan to Mollie in an audiblewhisperPoor Mollie looked quite horrorstruck for she felt sure that thesaucy words had reached Farrs earIf the man felt any annoyance he was most successful in concealing itfor his expression remained quite unchanged Not so with poor Jeanwho had flushed hotly at what she considered Nans unwarrantableimpertinence She made a swift angry little movement and the bookshe had been holding slipped to the deck Farr leaned forward andpicked it up As he returned it to her his eyes met hers with a quietreassuring smile for he had been quick to notice the girls silentchampionship and it had greatly touched him The color in Jeans facedeepened and with sudden shyness she dropped her eyesHave a cigar FarrTo these two Clifford Archers question came almost like aninterruption although no word had been spoken between themNo thanks taking from his pocket a silver case of curious designbut if no one objects I will light a cigaretteI cant help it cried Nathalie laughing until the tears were inher eyes did you hear the way he said that word cigarettewithsuch a lingering over each syllable I am sure you are a Spaniard MrFarr in spite of New JerseyI knew it Nan put in the moment you spokeAh exclaimed Nathalie drawing back in mock affright you are anexileHow interesting spoke Nan Do tell us all about itAbout what queried Farr coolly and Nan subsided feeling suddenlyvery much embarrassedEleanor Hill caught an expression half impatient in Farrs eyes andturned warningly to NathalieYou will be sorryWhen Im sober interrupted the young girl merrilyWhat a rowdy you are Nat Helen is looking at you mostdisapprovinglyA shrug of the shoulders was Nathalies only answer and starting upshe crossed over and stood before Farr where he sat at Jeans sideYou have been very good and patient she assured him with amischievous twinkle in her brown eyes and now I am going to rewardyou by unpacking the luncheon hamperThats a good idea cried Dick I am almost starved to deathWhat delicious salad exclaimed Churchill a few moments later asthey sat about the open hamper Miss Helen you are a culinaryartistHelen smiled her thanksMay I not sit by you Eleanor pleaded Clifford Archer droppingdown on the deck at her side With you near me I could never knowhunger or thirstNonsense frowning on him in seeming disapproval I think yourappetite is one which stands you in good steadHe was a handsome youth graceful in the extreme It was a constantsource of annoyance to Eleanor Hill that she found him so charmingfor she often assured herself there was nothing to the boy but hisgood looks and perfect manners But who will dare to say that theseare nothingI do hope there are plenty of sandwiches sighed Nan as she sateating her fourthDick tipped up the plate depositing a dozen or more in her lapThat enough he asked innocentlyYou idiot cried NanDo say something new Nan called Mollie from the other side of theboat That is the third time today you have given Dick thatappellationHow can I help it groaned Nan when it characterizes him soperfectlyYou cant said Nathalie consolingly and if I were you I would notattempt toDick looked at both girls with withering scorn then glanced by themas if their existence were a matter of small importHelen can I open the beer and ginger ale nowIf it will be any comfort to you Dick you have my consentI think I will try another sandwich if Miss Birdsall can spare meoneThen catch Mr Farr and Nathalie tossed him one with unerringaimO Nathalie protested Jean with changing colorWell I am glad to know he is not a muff said Nathalie as Farrcaught the sandwich What is the matter Jean I didnt know you wereso easily shockedLook out for the boom called Dudley most opportunely and theCyclone came swiftly aboutWhat an unfortunate move Now the sun is right in our eyes and Jeanlooked up at Farr appealingly Wont you please have it removedWhy certainly Are not your wishes my law and even as he spoke thesun slipped under a cloudWhat a wonderful man Eleanor Hill laughed softlyThe afternoon sped away all too rapidly and the hours were as minutesto the happy young people skimming the waters of the beautiful soundNature was at her very best this sunshiny summer afternoon Lightfleecy clouds scudded swiftly across the delicious blue of the vaultedsky above and in the distance the low farstretching Long Islandshore was bathed in a soft violet haze broken here and there bypatches of white glistening sandThe Cyclone with every yard of canvas set was running gayly beforethe breeze which since noon had grown strong and steady The swash ofthe water against the boat the slight straining and creaking of therigging the sighing of the wind in the sails were sounds sweet asmusic to the ear of every true lover of the seaAnd now the summer day began to wane and in the western sky the sunwas shining with a brilliant radianceAh sighed Jean softly as they dropped anchor in Hetherford Harborwhy do all pleasant things come to an endBut they invariably do and there was a touch of genuine regret inFarrs voice which was quite sincere for in this last pleasant hourhe had thoroughly enjoyed a delightful ttette with his prettycompanion and had every reason in spite of the merry chaffing ofthese gay young strangers to vote the day a great successCHAPTER VSUNSETHOUR ON THE CLIFFSThe following morning the girls were collected together in the upperbalcony of the manor where the clustering vines afforded a welcomeshelter from the suns hot rays A wicker table laden down with booksand work baskets occupied a central position and the low rockerswhich surrounded it were tilted swiftly back and forth as the girlsworked and chatted in an easy desultory way On the wideoldfashioned settle in the background sat Eleanor Hill and NanBirdsall Eleanor lounging lazily back among the cushions her handsresting idly in her lap Nan all curled up in a heap her sketchbookon her knee her deft fingers making rapid strokes with a longwellsharpened pencilDo you know spoke Eleanor Hill I fear we behaved very badlyyesterday I have had qualms of conscience ever since and a growingconviction that we made perfect fools of ourselves in the eyes ofthose two strange menBetter that than dullards laughed Nan lightlyHobsons choice said Jean drylyJust then Helen with a somewhat preoccupied air pushed back herchair and passed into the house her mind evidently intent on somedomestic question Nathalies eyes followed the retreating figureuntil it was quite lost from view in the shadowy hallway and thenwere bent thoughtfully on her work againTo change the subject girls she began after a moment devotingherself energetically to the threading of her needle and tossing herhead impatiently at every unsuccessful effort have you heard thenews Helens friend Miss Stuart is coming down upon us for avisitYes indeed we have Emilys sigh came from the depths of her heartI cant imagine what we will do with another girl hereWhat she will do with us may be more to the point and Jean raisedher eyebrows expressively I dont know how it is but I amapprehensive about this visit I suppose with a sort of honestprotest in her voice that I have never really liked Miss StuartNor I agreed Nathalie There is something about her that I do nottrust And the worst of it is with a grimace that she winds Helenaround her little finger It always makes me so angryNonsense Nat You do Helen an injustice objected Eleanorpleasantly However I frankly confess to a fear that the harmony ofour own little circle will be somewhat marred by the advent of astrangerThats so and then you know she is such a swell that she willprobably look down upon us poor country girls with the utmost scornand Nathalie gave a vindictive tug at her knotted threadOf course she is devoted to men queried Emily lugubriouslyOh I should judge so although I have never seen her with them Youknow she has only stopped with us in the winter season when we havebeen aloneLet us do her the justice to suppose that the men are equally devotedto her added Jean generouslyIt amounts to about the same thing whether she is devoted to men orthey to her and there was in Emilys tone such a note of tragicmelancholy that the girls could not refrain from laughingOh what a happy nook and cranny of the great world this dear oldHetherford is cried Eleanor clasping her hands behind her head andlooking out with dreamy eyes over the sweep of softly undulating lawnthat stretched away toward the manor gates It all seems so idyllicto me There is so much petty jealousy and miserable heartburningbeyond the confines of this little haven of rest Peoples motives areso often selfish that one grows strangely doubting even of onesfriends Do you know leaning forward impulsively and speaking withdeeper earnestness I think we girls have found the secret of truefriendshipmutual trust and respect These are what have made ourlong intercourse such a happy oneIndeed you are right Eleanor dear Jean replied gentlyThe bother of it all will be interrupted Nathalie following out herown train of thought that Mademoiselle will come here with trunksfull of fine clothes and we will be obliged to dress upI would like to see the girl who could make me discard my shirt andblazer laughed Nan defiantlyHow would we look en grande toilette with such hands as thesesaid Jean thrusting forward her own little brown onesAttractive but from a different standpoint Nan asserted with afine assumption of authority Everything depends upon your point ofview according to Henry James Now from my artistic pinnacletilting her head to one side and surveying the group with criticalbut approving eyes I declare I prefer brown hands to white onesBy the way asked Jean with wellfeigned indifference what didyou think of the naval officersTo return to our muttons murmured Nathalie with a sidelong glanceat her sisterMr Dudley was very pleasant and agreeable replied Emily but Ithought Mr Farr rather uninterestingWell laughed Eleanor demurely Nan is right Everything doesdepend upon ones point of view Now I thought Mr Farr decidedlyattractive and Mr Dudley just a goodnatured boyThat reminds me of something I saw in the paper the other day Jeanobserved smilingly To the question What is taste the answer wasgiven There is no such thing except on the principle that somepeople havent anyThat is a fine way of disposing of one and there was an expressionof quiet amusement in Eleanors eyes Never mind dear leaningforward and pinching Jeans cheek I will forgive you Besidesdropping her voice you know that you agree with meNow what are you girls whispering about complained Nathalie Ohbother this sewing she went on irrelevantly I have had enough ofit for today and the bit of work was tossed impatiently into herbasketThis was the signal for a general uprising and then as they weredispersing Nathalie made the announcementHelen has asked Mr Dudley and Mr Farr to dinner tomorrow nightYes answered Mollie turning back from the open doorway andCaptain Dodd and his wife too Dick says with an air of profoundconviction that they are delightfulThat settles it laughed Nan Dick cant be wrong Come on Molllinking her arm in Mollies I am going to take you home to luncheonwith me todayIt was late that afternoon when Jean who had been reading for hourson the quiet veranda suddenly jumped to her feet with a little sighof weariness and tossed her book into a neighboring chair She wastired of sitting still so long and felt in the humor for a walkSlowly she made her way down the broad steps and across the grounds ofthe manor Strolling on in a reverie and heeding but little in whichway her steps were taking her she came upon the great iron gateswhich opened out into the roadway Passing through them she wanderedlistlessly on toward the waterIt was the loveliest hour of the bright sunny June day Already theshadows were lengthening and a little whiff of cooler air wasstirring after the warmth of the noonday The sun was nearing thewestern horizon now shining out in bright radiance now obscured bysome light passing cloud The murmur of a little brook which followedthe roadside and the whispering of the wind among the leaves made asoft music Now and then a bird darted by overhead singing out ashrill note in some high key then dropping into a soft coo Asquirrel ran out from the thicket sped across the road anddisappeared over a low stone wallOh you foolish little chap exclaimed Jean halfaloud as MasterSquirrel gave her one glance from his bright eyes before dropping outof sight You are the swiftest little fellow I have ever seenIt was growing rough and heavy underfoot now and in a moment moreJean had reached the beach and was strolling down toward the cliffsThe water was alive with boats their white sails glimmering in thesunlight as the dying breeze bore them slowly on their wayAt the foot of the cliffs Jean paused a moment The glory of thegolden light fell on her slender girlish figure and illumined herwistful upturned face As her eyes rested lovingly on the beautifulscene that lay before her a deep sigh of pleasure escaped her slightlyparted lips for today the old familiar sights and sounds seemedstrangely new and sweet A narrow beaten track led temptingly to thesummit of the cliffs whence a magnificent view could be obtained andafter an instants hesitation she began the steep ascent Turning thecorner of a sharp rock which reared itself boldly into the air shecame suddenly to a standstill uttering a stifled exclamation foralmost at her feet stretched at full length in a sheltered cranny ofthe rocks lay Valentine Farr his hat drawn down over his foreheadhis eyes thoughtfully intent upon the distant horizon As Jeansexclamation reached him he glanced quickly up and sprang to his feetWhy Miss Lawrence this is indeed an unexpected pleasure You stolea march on me I did not hear your approach at allIndeed I am equally surprised Mr Farr and I assure you you reallystartled me I came upon you so suddenlyFarrs eyes rested admiringly on the soft color in the girls face asshe went onAnd may I ask how you hit upon my particular retreat in these rocksLet me warn you You can only make yourself happy in it with myespecial permissionI had no idea I was trespassing Pardon my curiosity but by whatright do you hold your title to this spot he queried with an amusedsmileBy the right of priority Do you know of any better Mr Farr witha pretty air of defiance When I was a little girl in pinafores Iplayed here with my doll when I was a schoolgirl I studied my lessonsin this dear spot and now that I am a grown woman drawing herselfup to her full height and glancing at him merrily I come here toread to ponder and to thinkA sacred spot indeed spoke Farr laughingly but with just a littlelowering of his voice I yield at once for I see that no one coulddispute your rightNo one She threw out her hand with a pretty gracious gesture Butwont you let me extend to you an invitation to occupy it whenever youfeel inclinedThanks ever so much he rejoined heartily You are very good Andnow cant I persuade you to rest a little after your climb MissLawrenceShe slipped down on the rocks and he threw himself at her sideWhat delightful times you all seem to have here he went on Do youknow I think this is a most charming place quite an Elysium Jeanssoft eyes lighted up with pleasureI am so glad you like it but I fear you will find very little tointerest you in so sleepy a placeFarr was about to make answer in words of conventional flattery butsomething in the girls tone of sincerity and good faith deterred himand impelled him to reply in kindBut I assure you I am delighted with it You know we knock about agood deal and some of our stations are almost unendurable We havebeen on the Sound for several months now and this is to me by far thepleasantest place in which we have cast anchorIt does my heart good to hear you say that she rejoined navelyfor naturally Hetherford is very dear to usYou have lived here all your life Miss LawrenceEver since I was a wee little girl Of course we have been away fromtime to time but we are always glad to get back againI can well understand your feeling so although I have had verylittle of home life myself Farr sighed as he uttered these lastwordsJean looked at him with gentle sympathy You say that sadly shesaidDo I He turned on his elbow and his grave eyes met hers His nextwords were prompted by a sudden unwonted impulse Perhaps I will tellyou about it some dayThen a silence fell between themThe sweet stillness held its sway oer land and sea its perfectharmony emphasized by the soft lapping of the waves against theshadowy sands below The breeze was dying with the dying sun Just offthe shore a little whitesailed catboat was drifting in with theflowing tideJean drew a long breath and started swiftly to her feetWhy how late it is growing she exclaimed I must be going MrFarrAlready he said and then they made their way down the ruggedcliffTake care Miss Lawrence he cried as she missed her footing andslipped a little Please let me assist you and he extended hishandJean put her hand in his with a demure uplifting of her eyebrows andjust a fleeting smile on her lips There flashed through her mind thethoughtHow unmercifully Nan would chaff me if she could catch a glimpse ofme nowThe descent was a brief one and soon they had crossed the sands andwere strolling along the road in the direction of the manorYou are coming to dine with us tomorrow night are you not MrFarrYour sister was good enough to ask us and I shall be only toodelighted to avail myself of her kind invitationI really will not let you come any further with me she declared asthey reached the manor gates I fear as it is I have taken you verymuch out of your way and it must be lateIt is close upon seven he told her after looking at his watch Andyou dineAt seven and let me warn you now that to be late is to meet with mysisters ireI shall remember he answered with his pleasant laugh And now canI not see you to your doorNo indeed I must hurry away she said as they shook hands fortime tide and dinner at the manor wait for no man GoodbyUntil tomorrow he said as he turned awayCHAPTER VIA DINNER AT THE MANORIt was the evening of the dinner given in honor of the naval officersand even as the old Dutch clock in the corner of the manor hall struckthe hour of seven Farr was shaking hands with Mrs DennisI am so sorry she said to him with a sweet smile that I shall beobliged to absent myself from the dinner table tonight but mystrength is not very great and I dare not overtax it My niece Helenwith a proud accent which was not lost upon Farr has taken my placefor so long that I feel no hesitation in leaving everything in herhandsOh Auntie cried Helen with shy deprecation Mr Farr will beginto think me that most tiresome of all things a paragon of householdvirtueFarr made a gesture of dissent and then as Clifford Archer presentedhimself he turned and followed Helen with admiring eyes Very fairand womanly she seemed to him in her gown of pale lavender crepemoving about among her guests greeting one and all with gentlecourtesyHis gaze wandered on to where in a further corner of thedrawingroom Nathalie was keeping up a merry chatter with WendellChurchill In spite of her eighteen years she looked a very childtonight in her white mulle gown with a broad white sash around herwaist and one red rose in her brown hair A spoiled child too sheundeniably was unused to restraint somewhat willful andquicktempered but with a heart so true and generous that one couldalways trust this small maiden and know that the good wouldpredominateEleanor Hill standing very erect her slender figure clad in aseverely simple gown of India silk her hair brushed straight from herfair face her blue eyes alight with intelligence her sensitive mouthrevealing every passing shade of feeling held his attention for amoment for there was something patrician in the girls mien andbearing which greatly charmed himInvoluntarily Farr smiled as he caught sight of Nans jolly facebeaming with an unending fund of good humor and he was man enough ofthe world for one glance at dainty Mollie Andrews to suffice to tellhim that she was an adept in the truly feminine art of dressing forher white gown covered with lace and embroidery was made in amysterious Parisian fashion not easily imitatedWhat an arrant little flirt was darkeyed Emily Varian The smile thatNan had evoked deepened as Farr noted the rapt expression on Dudleysface as he bent over her Her yellow gown while not as modish asEleanors and Mollies nor as artistic as the Lawrence girls yetshowed a fine sense of color and lighted up her pretty piquant facewhich was surmounted by a smooth coil of hair the color of a ravenswingThey were an unusually lovely group of girls and beyond thisunusually purehearted and intelligent Farr appreciated this the morekeenly perhaps in that he had seen much of the world in his thirtyyears of life Sometimes the old ideals of his boyhood had sufferedsadly but his faith in the gentler sex was too deeprooted to beeasily dispelled and now all that was noblest and most chivalrous inhis nature was awakened by the atmosphere of honesty and sweetnesssurrounding himHe was brought back to the startingpoint of his observations byHelens voice saying apologeticallyI am so sorry my sister is so late and even as she spoke a littlehand pushed the portires hastily aside and Jean stood in thedoorwayShe glanced impulsively across at Farr and caught a wicked gleam fromhis eyes as he advanced to meet herTime tide and dinner at the manor wait for no man he quotedmaliciouslyThat is one advantage in being a woman she promptly retortedShe was radiant tonight in a gown of silver and blue From underlevel brows her eyes shone like stars and some slight inward tremorof excitement flushed her sweet face with unusual color Her softyellow hair was gathered up in a simple coil little tendrils of itcurling upon her forehead and on her neckWhat a bonny little lass she is thought Farr surprised by thesudden feeling of tenderness which took possession of himThen dinner was announced and with a half cynical smile at his ownsusceptibility he pulled himself together and offered her his armWhy I am quite in the navy am I not she asked archly as she tookher place between Farr and DudleyYou honor it Farr returnedJeans brows contracted with a slight frown That savors of flatteryMr FarrI especially dislike your accusation Miss LawrenceThen I must be more careful not to run counter to your prejudiceshereafterIf you would be so good he said to her dryly then their eyes metand they both laughed lightheartedlyI hope you enjoyed the sail the other day I meant to ask you aboutit yesterday afternoonThoroughly Your songs were particularly delightfulJean blushed and answered in some confusionThey were very foolish I really hope you will forgive our absurdbehaviorCharming folly needs no apology Jean found the glance he gave her atrifle disconcertingBut pray Mr Farr do not she began and hesitatedDo not what he interrogated with a faint show of eagernessDo not allow your soup to grow cold she finished with a merryglance at him from under her long lashesWhile you are in Hetherford spoke Nathalie across the table toDudley you should make a point of going up to the cemetery Thereare some epitaphs there a hundred years old and they are so funnySo Andrews was telling us Speaking of epitaphs I was very muchamused by one I saw in a magazine the other day Let me see How wasit     Here lies the body of Mary Ann     With her head on the bosom of Abraham     Pretty soft thing for Mary Ann     But very hard lines on AbrahamHere is a good one cried Dick when he had partially recovered fromhis ebullition of mirth     Here lies the body of Mary Bin     Who having had her little fling     Burst this outer shell of sin     And hatched herself a cherubimHelen shook her head at Dick in gentle protestWhat will Captain and Mrs Dodd think of us she saidSuppose I should recall one to you all suggested the captain witha merry twinkle in his eyePlease do they cried in chorus     He heard the angels calling him     From that celestial shore     He flapped his wings and away he went     To make one angel moreSplendid exclaimed Nathalie with enthusiasm Mr Dudley and Dickare quite in the backgroundDick saw his in that charming novel Comin thro the RyeGuess I did Nancy By Jove girls he whispered mischievously youare all stunning tonight and he drew himself up with an air ofpride and satisfactionYou shine in a kind of reflected glory dont you Dick laughedNathalieAfter dinner they gathered about the great wood fire burning cheerilyin the drawingroom The evening had grown suddenly chill The windhad veered to the southeast and the strong sea breeze lowered thetemperature by many degrees a not uncommon occurrence in our AmericansummersHelen seated herself at the open piano and her music did much toenhance the charm of the hour She felt a bit sad tonight andsomething of her feeling crept into her music as she drifted into aplaintive melody with an oftrecurring refrain almost like a spokenregret As her eyes wandered about the firelit room with its faroffcorners half in mystic shadow there were awakened within her memoriesof happy childhood days when the love of her father and mother hadbeen the sunshine of their home Interwoven with these thoughts camethe recollection of one who in those days had been near at hand andwho was now far away in strange lands separated from her by morethan the mere expanse of restless watersShe sighed a little and bringing her music abruptly to an end roseand crossed the room After a few words of courteous explanation toMrs Dodd she ran away upstairs to assure herself that the childrenwere safely in bedJust as she was passing through the doorway she caught a glimpse ofJean who with earnest upturned face was talking interestedly withFarr and something she saw in her sisters blue eyes made her startWhat was there in that upturned face in those eyes which made Helenfeel so strangely as if something were going to happenAnd Eleanor Hill chatting gayly with Cliff Archer found her thoughtstraveling in much the same directionIn all these summers they had been a very happy little colony ofgirls and they had entered into a sort of compact in true girlfashion that no lover should be allowed in their midst to break thespell Helen had been engaged but that relation had existed previousto the making of the bond and she had been so little absorbed that noone had thought much about it One other exception had to be made forthere was no use in trying to hold Emily strictly to any suchagreement for flirt she would whenever the opportunity offeredHowever her digressions had been few and far between for CliffArcher and Dick were almost the only men who came to Hetherford andthey were so like brothers to her that a sentimental attitude towardeither of them would have seemed supremely ridiculousSo this summer had come around as many others had before and alreadya new element had entered into their midst and that naughty littleNathalie was at the root of the matter for ever since one bright dayin May when the Sylph had come sailing along these pleasant watersand Wendell Churchill had called at the manor to pay his respects theold order of things had been changed Until that day the Sylph hadbeen better known to Hetherford than her goodlooking owner forrarely had he cast anchor in the harbor without having aboard hisyacht a party of gay and fashionable people who urgently claimed hiswhole attention But now he no longer brought strangers to Hetherfordand when as now and then occurred he was obliged to absent himselffor a few days the Sylph lay at the disposal of the girls And allthis that little minx Nathalie had brought about laughing while shedisclaimed emphatically any disloyalty to the vows of their bondThe worst of it was the mischief was spreading and Eleanors eyesfalling just then upon Jean she experienced a sense of keenannoyance for warmhearted Jean had been the most wholesouled themost valiant of them all It was a great pity that the Vortex hadbeen stationed here and doubly a pity that there was no immediateprospect of her departure It would not do to be introducing all sortsof folly into their circleEleanor had quite worked herself up to a pitch of righteousindignation when on surveying the ground that had brought her to thispoint she became uncomfortably conscious of some slight changeswithin herself for here before her looking into her eyes and sayingall sorts of pretty things which of course were nonsensical was thefatal beauty whom she had always looked upon as a boy Halfvexedhalfamused she rose to go and when Cliff after helping her withher coat gently pressed her hand she felt immensely like boxing hisears It was idiotic and sentimental his looking at her in that wayand there was no occasion whatever for his saying goodnight like alover in a playThere was quite a little excitement and bustle of departure in thehallway as coats and cloaks were sought for found and donned Jeanstood by the large open fireplace where a log lay smoldering its redashes still giving out a grateful heat and at her side was Farr hatin hand a light summer overcoat on his arm He spoke a few words toher as he took her hand in parting and she looked up at him smilingand defiant The girls blue eyes were dark with unwonted excitementher cheeks flushed with bright color and Eleanor noted all this andfound her impressions of the evening deepenedWhen the last guest had gone Helen dropped down on the foot of thestairsOh how tired I am she exclaimed Do put out the lamps in thedrawingroom Nat like a good girl Then she rose to her feet with alittle sigh of weariness I think I am sleepy too she saidI wish I were spoke Jean from before the fire her whole expressioneminently wideawakeCome to bed Jeanie laughed Helen and court sleep Perhaps itwill come to you if you doJean paused a moment by the hall table to select one from out of themass of books and magazines collected there and then followed Helenup the stairsWhen she had reached her room she threw herself down in an easychairand opened her bookYou wont mind if I read for a while will you Nat There is no useof thinking of going to sleep yetNathalie whistled very softly at which Jean glanced swiftly up atherEh Jean Love at first sightJean blushed to the roots of her pretty hair and there was an angrylight in her eyesI wouldnt be a goose if I were you Nathalie she said scornfullyCHAPTER VIIA WALK IN THE SHRUBBERYIt was Sunday and Nan and Emily were sitting together on thevinecovered porch of the parsonage trying to while away the longhour between church time and the midday dinnerNan gave a prodigious yawn and stretched herself out in thecomfortable steamer chairOh dearie me she sighed I wonder if it would be a crime for meto admit how bored I was in church this morningWell I dont think it would be in very good taste considering yourfather preached replied Emily severelyI cant help it if he did I was tired and moreover crossly I amalways boredEmily raised her eyebrowsI am afraid Nan your soul longs for Gregorian chants and taperingcandlesOf course it does and acolytes incense and embroidered altarcloths Yes I admit it frankly I should have belonged to TheChurch she ended with great emphasisI know Em she continued after waiting a moment to observe theeffect of her last words you will think it absurd but I tell youI really envy the Lawrence girls To think that they attend thatdear delightful Episcopal chapel while I and the sentence endedwith a laugh Why Em of course you wont sympathize with me but Ido think it is bad formEmily looked really shockedNan Birdsall I am ashamed of you What would uncle think of youWell replied Nan with a perverse expression on her face I dontintend that the ministers sons shall have it all their own way Ihave just as good a right to live up to the old saying as any ofthemEmily would not stay to listen to another word and with a great airof dignity she arose and swept into the house Very soon the softtinkling of a bell told Nan that the noonday meal was ready Old MrBirdsall stood at one end of the table his hands folded on the backof the chair before him waiting for Emily and Nan to appear Whenthey were come the long grace was spoken slowly and impressively andno one watching Nans demure face would have guessed at her outbreakof the morningThey were a somewhat incongruous trio and what little conversationthere was consisted chiefly of goodnatured banter of Emily by theirrepressible Nan to which Mr Birdsall listened somewhatabstractedlyThe dinner hour had not as yet assumed a position of importance toeither of the girls and as soon as possible they pushed back theirchairs and once more sought the shady porch Emily gave one furtiveglance over her shoulder to assure herself that her uncle was notfollowing them and then picked up a novel from a neighboring tableand opened it with a great show of interest Nan watched the bit ofdeception and a smile spread itself over her facePuss she cried stooping to lift up a little white kitten which wasbrushing against her skirt it is now our turn to be shocked andhorrifiedHer remark being received in contemptuous silence for a while sheplayed languidly with the little creature in her lap then her handdropped at her side her head fell back against the cushions and Nanwas fast asleep The air was heavy and drowsy all about the insectshummed so lazily and the very atmosphere lulled one intoforgetfulness By and by the crunching sound of footsteps on thegraveled path roused Nan to sudden consciousnessOh dear Nan Emily was whispering in a tone of suppressedexcitement please wake up Here comes Mr Dudley I forgot to tellyou that I was going for a walk with himThats all right Nan interrupted her sleepily I am going in so hewont see me and lifting herself lazily from her chair she slippedinto the house through one of the French windowsWithin the house there reigned the solemn stillness of the Day ofRest The door of the study stood partway open and Nan could see herfather lying on his lounge his white head shining like silver againstthe dark leather of the cushion She stole in on tiptoe to avoidawakening him caught up a brightcolored afghan and threw it overhimHow sweet he looks she thought with great tenderness as shestooped and gently kissed him She paused a moment by the largewriting table to find amid a litter of papers an old hymnbookshabby from long usage and opening it marked the hymns selected forthe evening service Then she passed out and closed the door softlybehind her She waited a few moments until she heard Emily and MrDudley leave the porch then put on her hat and started across thelawn to the manor Coming out upon the driveway she met Helen walkingbriskly alongWell she cried where are you goingTo evening prayers Nancy Wont you come with meYes indeed I will I thought you never left the children SundayafternoonI dont usually but today I felt just in the humor for churchThere was a note of sadness in Helens tone which ordinarily Nanwould have readily detected but today the girl was possessed by asense of personal dissatisfaction and restlessness and so absorbedin her own mood this was lost upon her There was a pause of briefduration then Helen drew a long breath and resumed more lightlyHow sweet and sunny it is isnt it Nan I love these first earlydays of summer when everything is so fresh and green The countrydoesnt begin to look so lovely later in the seasonI suppose so returned Nan laconically I am such a country girlthat I dont half see the beauties about me When you are so used tothings I dont think you are apt to be so keenly alive to themI dare say that is true you see I go away just enough to appreciatethis dear place when I come back to itWhile I grumbled Nan have never been away from Hetherford but twoor three times in my whole life One year is just like another Thereis always father deeply interested in church matters and lookingupon me as an enigma and cross old Bridget who runs the house anddisapproves of me I often long to dance a jig before father and tothrow something at Bridgets head just to relieve the monotonyHelen laughed softly as Nans grievances multiplied knowing full wellhow it diminishes ones annoyances to be able to give voice to themThen Emily comes continued Nan with a scowl and tells me that myclothes are awful and that I look like a fright and wonders why Icant cultivate a slight interest in men I tell her laughingdubiously that I would if I found them eager to do their shareYou silly child and Helen squeezed Nans arm affectionately Iwont have you depreciate your dear selfBut Nan was not to be so easily divertedI do hope that some day I shall see something of the world shereplied I would like to lead an exciting life full of incident andadventure and oh dear me who could lead one less so I wishsomething new and interesting would happenO Nancy Helen said to her gravely dont be so anxious to havethings happen It is so much better when they dont little girlNan looked up at Helen and felt rebuked for her egotism as she sawthe shadow clouding her friends pale faceDissimilar as these two girls were in character a very warmfriendship existed between them Helen dearly loved Nan for her readywit easygoing ways warm heart and sunny nature and Nan simplyadored Helen looking up to her with the greatest admiration anddeferring readily to her judgment in all things There was a veryromantic side to Nans nature hidden away though it was beneath somuch nonsense and jollity and Helens love affair and its sad endinghad touched her keenly She thoroughly liked Guy and he on his parthad always shown a preference for her above the other girls Perhapshe had guessed at her strong love for Helen and partisanship forhimself for to her alone had he spoken of Helen on his return fromthat last unhappy interview His words had been few but Nan had seenthe real grief in his honest eyes and her heart had ached for himShe made a pretty shrewd guess at the real state of affairs and shefound her firm belief that Helens heart belonged to Guy and that itwould all come out right in the end greatly strengthened by herfriends present unhappiness and discontent Today she was full ofsympathy for Helen but she respected her reticence too deeply tobroach the subject so she consoled herself with the thought that thismood scored a point in Guys favor Her reverie was broken in upon byHelens voice saying gentlyI consider it a most fortunate thing Nan that I am carrying you offto church I am sure the service will do us both goodWell theres room for improvement in me laughed Nan You shouldhave seen Ems face this morning when I told her that my one ambitionwas to imitate the proverbial ministers sonNancy I am ashamed of you Helen remonstrated with a reluctantsmile Come be a good girl for we are just at the church door Letus give our hearts and minds to the service she added with sweetgravity and we will see how much peace will come to usI will dear Nan whispered as they started up the aisle to theLawrences pewThe rector of St Andrews leaned somewhat toward ritualism and noform nor observance that to his mind lent beauty and solemnity to theservice was omitted As the girls took their places the solemn chordsof the Stabat Mater inclined their hearts to reverential prayer In amoment more the doors of the vestry swung open and the organ took upthe sweet strains of the soulinspiring hymn Hark hark my soulSlowly the choristers filed by first the crossbearer his young facefull of dignity then the singers two by two and as their numbersswelled their fresh young voices filled the churchThe grace and beauty of the Episcopal form of worship appealed to NanThe rhythmic lines of the confessional We have erred and strayedfrom Thy ways like lost sheep etc moved her to a heartfeltpenitence for her shortcomings and inspired her with an earnestdesire to live more nobly and unselfishly One by one her petty trialstook their flight and only a sense of great peace remained When thebenediction had been pronounced and the girls had left the churchthey were both somewhat subdued and silent The slanting rays of thesun fell softly athwart the quaint old churchyard and on the faintlystirring breeze was borne the sweet perfume of roses and honeysucklewhich grew in such profusion against the low stone wall Passingthrough the gateway they strolled side by side along the roadI wish I could always attend St Andrews mused Nan slipping herhand within Helens arm I really believe I would be a better girlThe ritual impresses me so deeply and seems to bring religion home tome in such a convincing sort of wayI dont think that is at all unnatural but as time goes on Nan Ibelieve you will find that your love for outside things will diminishin proportion as your dependence upon what is deep and vital growsI would not fret about it in the least if it were not for my dearfather and Nans face grew tender as she spoke but I know thatthis disposition of mine toward forms and symbols is a source ofsorrow to him He would have me a strong adherent to the old school ofPresbyterianism and he feels that my tendencies are leading merapidly along the highway to Rome and Nans puzzled eyes met Helenswith a frank appeal for adviceHelen was silent for a moment and then spoke slowly andmeditativelyOf course Nan each person has to decide such a question forhimself but it seems to me that when two people love each otherdearly yet differ in their views each should be willing to make someconcessions and thus grow more generous and lenient with eachotherLove is such a great powerIndeed it is cried bighearted Nan and I know that the largershare of yielding should be mine for dear father has grown old in hisopinions and it must be very hard for him to have me branch out formyselfThey had reached a turn in the road where their paths diverged andNan askedYou will come over and sing hymns this evening wont you HelenCertainly Are they coming over from the innI suppose so and then with a friendly nod each went on her wayIt was close upon eight oclock that evening when Helen and Nathaliestarted out for the parsonage The lovely twilight hour was almostover High in the heavens rode the crescent moon and as the slowlyfading daylight vanished its white light penetrated the soft gloomwhich lay like a shroud over the manor park and trees and lawns andwinding paths came suddenly to life as by the touch of a fairy wandA sighing breeze stirred the leaves from a fountain near at hand camethe soft splash of falling waters and the night air vibrated gentlywith the myriad sounds of insect lifeThere was a rush and a scamper and around the corner of the housethe children raced and threw themselves upon Helen with a shout ofdelightYou naughty youngsters chided their sister gently You ought to bein bed this minute everyone of youWes going right off cried Gladys breathlessly Ony we wants tobe kissed firstHelen stooped down to fulfill their clamorous demandNow be off she laughed straightening herself up and shaking amildly reproachful finger at them and dont forget to go in and saygoodnight to Auntie and then she and Nathalie proceeded leisurelyon their wayThey found the vinecovered porch of the parsonage quite overflowingwith people Wendell Churchill and Farr stepped hastily forward andafter an interchange of cordial greetings found seats for themHow late you are called Nan from somewhere in the background Ithought you were not comingHelen left apologies and explanations to Nathalie and turned toanswer an inquiry from Farr in regard to JeanI am sorry to say she is deep in a book she said looking up at himwith a smile and we could not persuade her to leave it However shepromised to follow us shortlyAnd does Miss Jean always keep her promises Farr asked lightlyI think she does Helen rejoined meeting his eyes for an instantCome Helen Start some of the good old hymnsAt Mollies suggestion Helens clear soprano took up the refrain ofLead kindly light and the others joined in heartily From longpractice their voices blended beautifullyThey had been singing for nearly an hour when Farr rose quietly to hisfeetMiss Lawrence he said bending over her chair dont you thinkMiss Jean should be brought to a realizing sense of her delinquenciesand coerced into making some reparationIndeed I do she assented with a frank laugh but what are wegoing to do about itI dont think my desertion would be noticed if I should go in searchof her Farr suggested lowering his voice Do youHelen gave him a swift glance of amusementI would not hear thine enemy say so But go and see what yourpersuasive powers can doYou have put me on my mettle now he rejoined as he stepped overthe low railing and dropped noiselessly on to the grass below and itwas with a sense of amusement that he recognized his own impatienceand eagerness as he set out for the manorHe paused to light a cigarette then strode on over the soft turfrevolving many and varied thoughts in his mind The brightness diedout of his eyes and the lines of the mouth were stern andcompressed for tonight the past with its perplexities anddisappointments rose vividly before him In his thirty years of lifefortune had dealt him some severe blows and had set him adrift withmore doubts than beliefs more cynicism than sentiment His was a veryreserved and sensitive temperament and under the garb of laziness andindifference his troubles were jealously hidden from curious eyes Themans best self lay dormant and some influence was sorely needed torouse him to the necessity of facing his difficulties and conqueringthem before they should conquer himHe had left the hedge behind him and as he came out on thedriveway a gleam of light from the manor house shot out through thetrees and brightened his path Involuntarily he started and a visionof Jean Lawrences face came between his mind and all painful memoriesand robbed them of their stingReaching the veranda steps he threw away his cigarette mounted themand crossed to where the outer door stood hospitably open revealingthe wide hall within its shadowy recesses softly penetrated by thelight from a quaint lamp swung from the low studded ceiling Helifted the hand knocker and let it fall then pushing his hat back onhis head stared meditatively before him while waiting for a responseto his summons Not a sound broke the stillness and at length he tookhis hat in his hand and stepped across the threshold and made his wayto the entrance of the drawingroom across which the portires werepartly drawn His footfalls on the soft rugs scarce heralded hisapproach The scene which met his eyes was indeed a pretty one andfor a brief space he stood motionlessOn a low divan in a far corner of the room Jean had thrown herselfwith unconscious grace of pose The warm coloring of the Oriental rugand brightcolored cushions made a charming background for the slenderwhiteclad figure A tall lamp shed a bright light across the openpage of her book on which her eyes were riveted Her face was flushedwith interest her soft hair in fine disorder Farr noted everythingfrom the golden head resting upon the silken cushions to the daintyslippered foot just peeping beneath the hem of her gownA slight movement on his part discovered him to Jean and she startedup in dismayWell Mr Farr you did give me a fright she cried laughingconfusedly for his steady gaze disconcerted her somewhat I shouldthink you would be ashamed of yourself for having startled me soI am recovering himself with a slight effort for the swift changethat had swept over Jeans expressive face at his unexpectedappearance had set his heart to beating with unwonted emotion Youwill forgive me will you not he finished as he stood at her sideand looked penitently down at herWhy yes but I dont advise your making a practice of strolling intopeoples houses and appearing suddenly in their drawingrooms youmight be mistaken for a burglar and I have heard with a maliciouslittle laugh that it is unpleasant to be shotOh come now Miss Jean you are very unfair to me if you only knewthe real facts of the caseBut Jean was still a little resentful for she felt that she had beentaken at a disadvantageReally she answered incredulously with a mischievous shrug of theshouldersYes very he protested with a glance of amusement into herupraised eyes I did everything I could to gain admission in theregulation way but was quite unsuccessfulWhat a shame she said interrupting him with softened voice Isuppose the maids were all out in the garden for a stroll this finenight and I was so absorbed in my book that I didnt hear theknockerAnd then he resumed with a valiant disregard of the truth I camein making as much ado as I conveniently could without calling out oroverturning the furnitureUnder the circumstances I see that you must be forgiven Wont you beseated Mr Farr I dont know what I have been thinking of to allowyou to remain standing all this whileThank you no On the other hand I want to persuade you to ariseWhyBecause I am here on a mission I have come to reproach you for notkeeping your promise to join us at the parsonageAnd to whom am I indebted for this kind and flattering interestNone other than myselfOh you are too good she cried laughingly springing to her feetand making him a sweeping obeisanceIf that is your honest opinion Miss Jean suppose you prove it bygoing back with meI cant be a traitor to my words and she tossed her book on to thetable and preceded him out into the hallwayIs it cool enough for a wrapFarr surveyed her muslin gown with a critical eyeIndeed it isAll right she yielded carelessly but I never take coldShe picked up a coat from the rack and Farr helped her on with itand then they wandered out into the nightIs it not delicious Jean sighed as they sauntered leisurely alongIt seems so to me he returned with a glance into the girls eyesMiss Jean he began after a brief silence Did you not tell meonce that there was a pretty walk through the shrubberyYes with a note of interrogationIn which direction would it lead us if we should take it nowTo the parsonage eventually but hesitatingly by a much longerway than by the path through the hedgeThe longer the betterfor meI dont know what they will think has become of us she demurredFarr laughed easilyI never trouble myself too much about what people thinkI dont doubt that you are in no way different from the rest of yoursex I believe it is generally conceded that selfishness is itssalient characteristicA popular fallacy Do I not prove it to you Miss JeanOh of course you are the exception that proves the rule shereturned with gentle sarcasmHe stopped suddenly midway in the path they were traversing andlooked straight down at her There was a ring of deeper feeling in hisvoice as he spokeI want you to think just as well of me as you can and I cannotimagine having a more earnest desire than that I might always proveworthy of your kindest thoughtsThere was a tinge of defiance in Jeans manner as she answered himflippantlyDont you think I would be using my time rather aimlessly Mr Farrwere I to give it up to thoughts of youAn expression of keen displeasure crossed Farrs faceI beg your pardon he said stifflyInstantly Jean repented of her foolish words and was heartily sorryto have wounded her companion but the slight tremor at her heartwarned her that to confess would be unwiseI think of you quite as much as you deserve she ventured with anervous little laugh and she began to walk on toward the shrubbery ata brisker paceFarr made no immediate rejoinder and when he spoke again it was in analtered toneThere is quite a fragrance to this boxwood is there notYes indeed and a very pleasant one The perfume is heavy these warmnights after the sun has been shining on it all dayYou have no idea what a charm the country has for me I have reallybeen in it so little since I was a boyBut your home is in the country is it notYes but my family spend the winters in Washington and our countryhome is only open during the summer months I dont often get a chanceto go down there My mother keeps the house pretty well filled for mytwo married brothers live at homeAnd have you no sistersFarrs voice which had sounded a little cold when speaking of hishome changed to sudden tendernessYes one and she is the dearest little girl in the worldI suppose you love her dearly and do your best to spoil herWell Clarisse and I are certainly great chums he assentedHow nice it must be to have an older brother We girls have alwaysregretted so that we did not have one although with a sad littlesigh we used to have a dear old friend who was just as good as abrother but he has gone away nowI suppose that there are times when they are of some use said Farralthough men are so hopelessly selfishI would not think of contradicting you Jean laughingly averredCome we are talking a great deal and not making much headway andit must be growing lateI am all tangled up in this maze of bypaths In which direction isthe parsonage from hereIf you dont mind climbing a stone wall we can turn to our rightand take a short cut and we will be there in no timeFarr agreed and they walked on in silence until they had emerged fromthe shrubbery into a small clearing skirted on the further side by awall its line broken at a certain point where some stones had beenthrown down Farr sprang lightly across and turned back to assistJean Just then the moon which had slipped under a cloud shone outagain its soft rays falling directly on the girls face She had onefoot already on the first stepping stone when he put up his hand tostay herWell she asked as he did not speak What is it Are you not goingto help meOf course I am but leaning a little toward her this wall is asort of a Rubicon Once crossed we cannot go back for we are then inthe parsonage grounds It has been a pleasant walk and one to beremembered has it notYes she murmured with a quick indrawing of her breathI wish he began impetuouslyMr Farr she interposed with gentle decision will you please helpme overHe gave her his hand and gravely assisted her to the ground on theother sideThey were nearing the porch and already the sounds of gay voicesreached them through the stillness of the summer night when Jeanturned abruptly to the man at her sideBy the way Mr Farr we are to have a visitor shortly and I hopeyou men will help us to make it pleasant for herHe uttered some polite commonplace and Jean went onPerhaps you know Helens friend a Miss Stuart of New YorkA sudden recollection flashed through Farrs mindNot one chance in a thousand that it should be the same he thoughtas he answered indifferently I think notI thought possibly you might have met she said carelessly Sheseems to know almost everyoneHe half turned to put a question to her but already they were at thevinecovered porch and Nans jolly greeting lost him the opportunityCHAPTER VIIINAN REBELSInto the days that followed were crowded more gay doings than thequiet village of Hetherford had ever seen before Old Dr Birdsallshook his head disapprovingly over all this unseemly frivolity butAunt Helens gentle voice championed the young folks and persuadedhim to allow Nan to join in the good times The naval officers were inconstant demand whenever they were not on duty and at the end of theweek the other men came out from town and their advent was the signalfor a series of rides drives walks tennis matches and amusementsof every descriptionEmily pronounced herself perfectly satisfied and when Nan and Molliegrumbled over a few of the changes that had followed in the train ofall these merrymakings she declared them heretics and disdainfullyturned her back upon themIt was after a day on the Vortex that Eleanor Nan and Mollie sattogether in Eleanors box of a room in the inn and held a council ofwarThey had had a beautiful sail There was a smoky souwester blowingand Uncle Sams schooner decked in holiday attire had flown beforethe wind like a bird Captain Dodd proved a genial pleasant host andMrs Dodds heart had been quite won by Helens notice of herthreeyearold boy a jolly little chap whose towcolored hair showedin strange contrast to his sunburned face No stone had been leftunturned to make the day successful and as the girls were all goodsailors the stiff breeze and careening of the boat only added zest totheir enjoymentHowever nothing in this world is quite perfect Nan and Molliescowled at the general tendency to wander off in pairs Mollie termedit bad form while Nan sniffed and called it utterly ridiculousFinally Nan was roused to action She called to Jean who with Farrat her side was leaning against the rail well up forward anddemanded a recitation Jean complied somewhat reluctantly She stoodin the midst of the little group one hand holding fast to thecompanionway to steady herself the other tucked away down into thepocket of her reefer She hesitated a moment searching about in hermind Her choice at length fell upon one dearly loved by all thegirls called Sister FelicitThe beautiful lines were spoken with the greatest simplicity butthere was a depth of pathos in the girls low voice that went straightto the hearts of her hearers The short silence that followed her lastwords was more flattering in its import than would have been theloudest applause There was a slight pallor in the girls face whenshe had finished and during the rest of the afternoon she was verysubdued and Farr who had been deeply impressed by her rendering ofthis sad and beautiful poem seemed to share her moodNan and Mollie who were both a little rebellious at the turn affairswere taking noticed this incident and so the council of war had beencalled Nans conscience was quite clear and she plunged bluntly intothe conversationNow that Jean has turned sentimental and emotional I think it ishigh time for us to take matters in hand Em always has been abackslider from the compact but when Jean begins that sort of thingit is going a little too farPunning is sadly out of place Nan on such a serious subjectlaughed Eleanor not sorry for an excuse to interrupt the discussionNan was thoroughly in earnest and beyond a chuckle at her owndiscomfiture she took no notice of Eleanors frivolityI dont think love affairs are much fun anyway sighed MollieSurely Helens was miserable and only resulted in making everybodyunhappy and uncomfortableThat strikes me as a trifle pessimistic Moll said Eleanor Happymarriages may be rare but it cant be denied that they existOh dearie me groaned Nan when you talk like that you make mefeel as if the world were turning upside down I never dreamed of itbeing a question of love affairs and marriagesI was not referring to anyone in particular Eleanor protestedhastily we were merely arguing in an abstract way Werent weMollAll I meant was Nan went on in a dolorous voice that we have lostour originality when we begin to act just like other girlsflirtingand all that sort of rot We used to have fun in the good old dayswhen we all staid together There were never any discussions as to howwe should walk or drive for everybody was willing to go with everybodyelse Ttettes were unheard of and nobody was ever sillyMollies sentiments chimed in with Nan but Eleanors assent wassomewhat slower in comingI suppose it is only a question of time she said for the Vortexcant be here much longer and Mr Churchill always takes the Sylphback to town in September Then we can settle down and have a goodoldfashioned time during the autumnWhen will Cliff go Nan asked with a sly laughEleanor turned her head away to hide the telltale color that rose inher faceOh come Nancy your imagination is running away with you Nothingwill satisfy you short of the banishment of the sexQui sexcuse saccuse quoted Mollie in an undertoneEleanor laughed in spite of herself She pushed back her chair andcrossed to the open window Along the dusty highroad Cliff camesauntering When he was just in front of the inn he looked up andcaught sight of Eleanor He raised his hat and called out to her tocome down and go for a stroll before supper She gave him a curtrefusal and turned back into the roomYou shouldnt punish Cliff for my impertinence reproved Nan Itwas not his faultEleanor frowned and spoke impatientlyCliff is only a boy and a rather foolish one at that But tocontinue All this nonsense as you call it Nan will be of briefduration and my advice is to make the best of itThere is a worse time coming Mollie declared The Vortex haswrought changes enough but I dont suppose we will recognize the oldplace at all when the magnificent Miss Stuart arrivesSufficient unto the day said Nan Well goodby girls I must beoffWhen the door had closed upon her two friends Eleanor went back tothe window and leaning against the casement looked abstractedly outShe thought of Cliff and the disappointed look his face had worn whenshe spoke to him so rudely Certainly Cliff had come under the spellthat was over them all this eventful summer She had striven to deterhim but in spite of her best efforts he had found a moment in whichto tell her of his love To this she had lent the coldest ear holdingout to him no hope whatever Cliff had listened very patiently butthere was something in his quiet refusal to accept this answer asfinal that had made Eleanor woman of the world as she was feelsingularly helpless They had taken up life again just where they hadleft it before Cliff spoke and since then no reference had been madeto the matterThe smile had quite died out of Eleanors face She went over to herwriting table and picked up a little note which Cliff had written heron some trifling matter She looked at it for a moment then halfraised it to her lips With a shamefaced laugh she dropped it backamong the letters on her table and turned impatiently away                                   One sultry morning toward the end of July as Helen sat sewing on theupper balcony a maid came out through the French window with a smalltray in her hand on which lay a yellow envelope Helen leaned forwardand picked up the telegramThank you Susie Is the boy waitingYes MissWell you may go I will bring the answer down myself when I have itreadyWhen the maid had withdrawn Helen tore open the envelope The messageread thus Can you come to town for the night Want to see youPlease dont disappoint L SHelen read it through twiceOh I should love to go she thought I wonder if Auntie or thegirls would objectShe folded the telegram and fitted it into the envelope and then satlooking absentmindedly at the address the while her face wore apuzzled look Her indecision lasted for an instant only and then shesprang up and ran through the hallway to Mrs Dennis roomAunt Helen met her request with a ready consent and in a moment thelittle boy was riding off to the station with Helens answer carefullystowed away in the pocket of his coatAs Helen entered her room a glance at the clock told her that a littlecelerity would enable her to catch the twelve fortyfive express andshe went to work with a will to collect her traps She was in themidst of packing when a knock came at the door and Jean withoutwaiting for permission entered She looked around the disordered roomwith a questioning glanceWhat is the matter she askedHer sister answered from the depths of her closetI am going to town unexpectedly and you are just the girl I want tosee Jeanie for I have a lot of things to say to you before I leaveWhere are you going to stayWith LillianJeans face fell and she spoke coldlyWhat train do you takeThe twelve fortyfive and I havent a moment to spare It must benoon nowIt is The village clock struck as I came inOh dear Put those things in the valise Jean wont you while Ihunt for my hat and gloves The carriage will be at the door in fiveminutesJean complied and as she was making room for the last few articlesin the already crowded valise Helen came and stood beside herDearie she said as she drew on her gloves will you please bevery attentive to Aunt Helen while I am away and not leave her toomuch alone And oh Jean do look after the children Dont have themoff your mind for a moment I am always so afraid that something willhappen to them when I am not hereJean laughed cheerilyThat is nonsense Helen Why in the world should you worry Of courseI will look after themI know you always do dear only I wanted to remind youWell you need not be anxious When will you returnTomorrow I think You might have the carriage meet the afternoonexpress Now I must flyJean caught up the valise and carried it downstairs while her sisterwent to say goodby to Mrs DennisThe carriage was already at the door when Helen came out on theveranda She stopped a moment to kiss the boys and charge them to begood and caught Gladys up in her armsDo you want to go to the station with sisterCourse I do enthusiasticallyHelen put the child in the carriage and then stepped in beside herIs my valise in JeanYes dear Goodby and have a good timeI will replied Helen as Nathalie took her place on the front seatand gathered up the reins Remember Jean you have the entireresponsibility of the children and do not let Gladys out of yoursightJean nodded smilingly and stood on the steps and watched the carriageuntil a turn in the road bid it from viewThen as she slowly made her way into the house the light died out ofher face and involuntarily she sighedI wish I did not distrust Lillian Stuart as I do she thought Itis so unfoundedas yetCHAPTER IXA FLYING MACHINE AND WHAT CAME OF ITEarly that same afternoon Eleanor and Nan dropped in at the manor andsuggested a game of tennis The Lawrences acquiesced and after asearch for balls and rackets they wandered down to the courts Jeanstopped behind for a moment to find the children and tell them tofollow her for nurse had begged a holiday and had gone off for theafternoon The suns hot rays beat down upon the unshaded courtsdiscouraging even Nans enthusiasm so after one set played withflagging energy they threw down their rackets and retired to a prettylittle summerhouse just at the foot of the terrace By and by whenthey were cool again Eleanor arose and suggested that they shouldstroll down toward the station to meet Cliff and Dick who were comingup early Jean alone demurred It was sweet and peaceful within theshelter of the little summerhouse and the prospect of a long hot walkalong the dusty road was not tempting Most opportunely she rememberedHelens injunction in regard to the children and pleading this excuseshe sent the others off with a halfpromise that she might join themat the inn later if nurse should get home in good seasonWhen Jean was alone she leaned back in her comfortable corner withan air of great contentment She rested her elbow on the ledge of theseat and propping her chin in her hand gazed dreamily unseeingly outacross the sunlit lawn The children were playing under the shade of awidespreading elm and the clear treble of their young voices was apleasant accompaniment to her happy thoughts Now and again as somelook or gesture of Farrs recurred to her with peculiar distinctnessa shy and tremulous joy dawned in her face and lingered thereAh Jean such moments are indeed golden when in your dreams all lifeseems sweet and fair Do not hasten the inevitable awakening for withthe realization comes ever a sting to make the heart ache and throbIn after days this peaceful scene will live with you the memory ofits happiness haunt and mock you until you fain would thrust it fromyouMeanwhile Valentine Farr was making his way down the terraced pathwayin search of Jean his heart strangely stirred with the thought of thesweet voice that would speak to him of the pair of blue eyes thatwould welcome him Then as he walked blithely on there fell on himthe shadow of a memory fraught with pain He threw back his head anddrew a deep breath as he squarely faced the difficulties that laybefore him He knew that before he might dare to hope before he mightdare to speak to Jean there was much that must be told her andalthough his heart grew heavy within him the look of resolution onhis grave face betokened a strong determination to overcome allobstacles so far as lay within his powerHe was descending the last terrace when little Gladys ran out fromher shady playground and holding out her arms to him begged for aride He caught her up and swinging her on to his shoulder held herthere securely as he hastened on toward the summerhouse whence he hadseen a flutter of Jeans white gown Gladys was wild with excitementand her shrill little cries of pleasure roused Jean from her reverieShe shifted her position a little to see what was going on and thenstarted up and moved forward to the arched doorway of the summerhouseand stood waiting for them From her elevated position Gladys wavedfrantically to her and then flung her arms tightly around Farrs neckThat is hot work little one he declared with a laugh as hedeposited the child on the ground and raised his hat to JeanOh it was grand cried Gladys capering around and shaking hergolden curls into a tangled massJean smiled and extended her hand to Farr but her words were forGladysI have not a doubt of it darling she said but I fear Mr Farrfound you a very heavy load to carry this hot dayGladys head drooped and she gave Farr a shy glance from out of thecorners of her eyesWas I vewy heavy she asked in such a plaintive little voice thathe had hard work to keep his face straight as he hastened to reassureherIs not this a sylvan retreat and are you not glad you came Jeanqueried looking over her shoulder at him as she led the way into thesummerhouseGlad he echoed Glad does not begin to express itWait until you see how sleepy and stupid I am before you make such arash assertion Evidently you are in no way disheartened she addedas Farr looking somewhat incredulous took his place beside her onthe low seatNot one whit he replied softly It would be a very novelexperience for me to find you stupidJean turned a quizzical glance upon himWhat an extravagant compliment Where did you learn such gallantryWhen first I saw you he returned and although he spoke lightlythere was an undercurrent of earnestness in his toneGladys who had been chasing a butterfly around and around thesummerhouse now stopped at the doorway and peeped in She lingered amoment tilting her head first on one side and then on the other andsmiling encouragingly on the twain Then as neither Jean nor Farrtook any notice of her she twisted about and scampered off toward theplayground Larry and Willie hailed her with delight and anyonewatching the three little heads so close together would have knownthat there was mischief brewingI know some splendid fun Willie was saying in a cautiously loweredvoice I read lots about it in a book Its all about flyin machinesan human birds Lets go over to the orchard an Ill tell you howto play itMe too Willie please piped GladysOh yes You can come along cause youre just the person we mightwant and Willies air of importance was most impressiveI guess Jean wont mind said LarryWillie was far too excited to vouchsafe a reply and the childrenscurried along toward the orchard Their route lay past thesummerhouse and when they were opposite it some pinprick ofconscience made them pause and look within Jean and Farr were deeplyabsorbed in conversation and it was quite apparent even to theirchildish minds that their sister would never notice their absence Ofone accord they broke into a run and did not subside into a moredemure pace until the shrubbery hid them from viewYou see said Willie when he had recovered his breath it is thegreatest fun to play birds All weve got to do is to use our armsright an then we can fly good enough It said so in the book heended with a wise little nod of his headGladys eyes grew big with wonderCan I fly too she pleadedCourse you can Youre just the most principalGladys beamed upon him and her face wore a proud smile To haveWillie call her the most principal was a very deep and farreachingcomplimentWillie heaved a sigh of relief when after scrambling over the stonewall they were at last within the orchardNow nobody can find us Weve all got to learn to fly See Larryyou just flop your arms so Theyve got to be our wingsDont guess Ise got any wings sighed Gladys cause they dontfy me a bitWillie and Larry were racing around the orchard swinging their armsin the air until they looked like animated windmills Gladys trottedafter them striving to imitate their motions until her little legsand arms grew very weary Then she stopped and stood watching themdisconsolatelyI dont fink you games any fun at all she exclaimed in anaggrieved tone as the boys ran up to her puffing and panting fromtheir exertions You dont fy a bit like birdies any more nor IdoWillie eyed her with great scornOh youre only a baby Course you cant do anythingYou said I was most principal Gladys reminded him with quiveringlipsOh I say Larry broke in Ill tell you what well do Will Wellplay shes a baby bird an then well teach her to fly We must puther up in a tree an then pretend to shove her out of the nest justthe way the mamma bird doesGladys face brightened and she smiled sunnilyPraps objected tenderhearted Willie she might tumble herselfan break her wingsLarry scouted the ideaYoure a regular muff Will Gladys aint afraid are you GladysCourse I arent cried Gladys stoutlyAfter an exciting and somewhat heated discussion the boys finallyarrived at a satisfactory decision as to the best way of gettingGladys up into a tree and in the midst of much chaffing and somewrangling a rustic bench was drawn to the foot of a gnarled old appletree and the difficult task was begun Oh dear ejaculated Willievery red and very warm Shes a terrible heavy birdThey were in a perilous position and Gladys burst of laughter nearlybrought them all to the groundGuess I eated too many worms she saidWhen at last she was safely perched on a projecting branch Willieclambered down and drew away the bench and Larry sitting astrideanother branch assumed the rle of master of ceremoniesNow little bird he said authoritatively I aint goin to bringyou any more worms to eat an you just got to learn to fly yourselfYou must flap your wings like this an when I count three you mustfly awayGladys first attempt to follow these instructions nearly upset herbut she regained her balance and gripping tight hold of an overhanginglimb turned a troubled face toward her brotherI guess my wings is gwowed wongCause there aint any feathers on em I spose giggled LarryThis sally proved too much for Gladys and flinging back her head sheburst into a merry peal of laughter In her sudden movement her littlehands lost their hold on the limb and plunging forward she fellheavily to the ground One sharp cry and then the child lay still andsilent her little white face upturnedOh gasped Willie praps shes broke her wingsLarry slipped quickly down from the tree and leaned anxiously overhis little sisters prostrate formGet up Gladys he pleaded and then as the child did not stir hebegan to cry piteouslyFor an instant Willie stood irresolute his hands tightly clinchedhis ruddy face grown pale with fearIm going to find Jean he said and turned and started on a runtoward the shrubberyLarry caught hold of him and clung to him in an agony of fearIm awfully scared Willie Please dont leave meWillie shook him off impatiently and pointed a reproachful finger towhere Gladys lay in an unnatural stillness and then without anotherword he was gone                                   During all this time Jean had not once thought of the children andHelens injunctions had been completely forgotten While Farr waswaiting an opportunity to broach the subject that was uppermost in hismind Jean herself opened the way for him She had been telling him inher happiest vein of numberless incidents of her childish dayslaughing outright at the memory of many a scrape and frolic andspeaking with a pathetic quiver in her voice as she showed him thereverse side of the picture recalling those dreary days when to thepoor little orphaned Lawrences in their desolation it seemed thatthe light of their lives had been forever darkenedAs Farr listened to the innocent recital told in Jeans own forcefuldramatic way he found his heart growing very tender yet sad withalIt made him feel infinitely far away from her to hear her speak thuslovingly and trustfully of her family Ah yes love was indeed thekeynote of life at the manor Farr had never realized this morestrongly than he did today as he mentally contrasted the happyatmosphere the tender relationships of Jeans home life with his ownunloved unhappy boyhood So deep was he in thought that he did notnotice that Jean had ceased speaking until she turned and called himby nameMr Farr I have been very egotistical and I want you to do me agreat favor to prove that you have forgiven meI would find it hard to refuse youDo you remember that day down on the cliffs so long agoFarr signified his assent and she continuedWell that day you said that perhaps sometime you would tell mesomething of your lifeFarrs face flushed with gratification and he would have spoken butshe stopped him almost imperiouslyI have thought that your perhaps signified a great deal that itwas put in to save yourself in case on further acquaintance with meyou felt that you did not want to give me your confidence and Iconfess looking up at him with a reproachful smile that I havebeen not a little hurt by your silencePlease dont say that Miss Jean and do you know that strangelyenough I came here today to tell youto tell you that miserablestory but I scarcely knew how to begin itHe paused a moment and then resumed bitterlyI never knew half how miserable the story would sound to you until Ilistened to you this afternoon and realized all that I had missed outof my lifeJean looked at him sympathetically and her eyes urged him tocontinue although she did not speakI am going to try not to bore you with any complaints Miss Jean andI must beg you not to be distressed if I speak plainly in regard to myfamily with whom I am on exceedingly bad termsSurely that does not include ClarisseOh no not Clarisse bless her heart She and I have always stoodfaithfully by each other My troubles began when my father died I wasquite a little chap at the time but I loved my poor old governordearly My mother is a woman of great strength of character and withan unbounded love of power and she and I were decidedly antagonisticMy father who was the mildest of men had the greatest admiration forher and in most things yielded readily to her stronger will but whereI was concerned he took a firm stand so although I was in great aweof my mother I always had a refuge in my father My older brothersLansing and Fred never took to me at all They were wise in their dayand generation and even when they were youngsters studied to pleaseand so in our quarrels and disputes my mother invariably took theirpart I felt the injustice without being able to reason about it andgrew daily more surly and defiant From the day my father died I had avery bad time of it and was always in disgrace I know I was by nomeans blameless but there was something in my mothers cold disregardof me that roused a very demon of defiance in me Clarisse was theonly person in the world whom I honestly loved and the first serioustrouble with my mother was on her account and even at this dayFarrs face grew black at the remembrance It was a rainy day and wechildren were all playing in the nursery Clarisse was just recoveringfrom an illness and was not yet very strong In some way sheaccidentally broke a new boat of Freds He was angry and afterscolding her until she began to cry finally struck her across theface I sprang toward him my blind rage lending me unusual strengthand beat him unmercifully Lansing nurse and Clarisse set up a greathue and cry and in the midst of it all my mother walked into theroom Fred who certainly did present a rather battered appearancerushed to her and bawled out a garbled version of the affair and Islunk off into a corner looking thoroughly guilty I have not adoubt My mother did not wait for any explanation but summarily sentClarisse and myself to Coventry I might have forgiven her for theinjustice to myself I was so used to it as to have hardly noticed itbut I never forgave the unkindness to poor little ClarisseThere was a brief silence broken at length by JeanI cannot understand it Mr Farr surely a mother must love all herchildrenI suppose my mother did in her way I do not tell you this MissJean to prejudice you against her nor to exonerate myself but onlyto in a measure explain subsequent events There was never anysympathy between us My manner my character my very looks weredistasteful to her and she made no attempt to conceal this from meUp to the time of this occurrence I had had moments of feeling verycontrite when I had striven to overcome my faults but from that timeI hardened myself and never tried to break down the barrier that hadbeen raised Clarisse shared my feeling to a great extent but she wasfar too gentle and loving to oppose my mother She did her best tosoften me and to prevent circumstances from embittering me As I grewolder my relationship with my family became more and more strainedand it was my great ambition to enter the navy and cut adrift from myhome When finally I broached the subject to my mother I learned forthe first time that my father had left his entire estate which was aconsiderable one to my mother and that I was entirely dependent uponher My mother was exceedingly generous in those matters and injustice to her I must say that however much she may have denied meher affection she always treated me most liberally in a material wayI had been given every advantage without stint and had been broughtup in the greatest comfort and luxury and without any adequateknowledge of the value of money She did not favor the idea of myentering the navy but I was troublesome at home so she made aconcession and I was allowed to go to Annapolis In the meantime mybrothers had obediently followed the careers my mother had marked outfor them and having furthermore married in accordance with herwishes she provided each of them with a most liberal allowanceretaining however a controlling hand in their affairs Those yearsat Annapolis were the happiest I had ever known I had been very muchtouched by my mothers yielding and when I was at home I did my bestnot to annoy or antagonize her in any way and we really got alongvery smoothlyFarr had reached a difficult point in his story and hesitated amoment to mentally review the past and then began again in the samequiet voice that had characterized his telling of it so farThe summer preceding my senior year I went home to find stopping inthe house a distant cousin of mine a very nice pretty girl whom Ishortly discovered my mother had selected to be her thirddaughterinlaw Then I revolted In the first place Carrie poorgirl was quite ignorant of the scheme and felt no interest whateverin me and He broke off undecidedly and looked with thoughtfuleyes out across the level tennis courts There was one thing he couldnot quite make up his mind to recount to Jean The memory of it wasgrowing faint he could not but smile a little grimly as he thusargued to himself and why rake up that disagreeable part of hispast In truth how could he tell cleareyed purehearted Jean ofthat otherWell interrogated Jean cutting short his brief reverieHis indecision was at an end He straightened himself squared hisshoulders and answered with almost a show of reliefWell the very fact that I was to be compelled to marry aroused sucha tempest of resentment within me that I had no room for any otheremotion For several weeks the atmosphere was thunderous and at theend of that time the storm broke I boldly announced my determinationto remain single My motherwell she did not spare me She told me Ihad always been a most unnatural and ungrateful son that I haddeliberately and intentionally thwarted her in every possible waywithout once considering the duty that I owed to her She gave me tounderstand most emphatically that from the day I finished my courseat Annapolis she would consider her obligations to me at an end ThatI might go where I pleased do what I pleased but that her home wasno longer mineOh how cruel escaped from Jean Her little hands were tightlyclenched and her eyes flashed indignantlyIt did seem rather hard especially just at that time he returnedslowly some unexpected thought lending an expression peculiarlysomber and grave in his face But since then I have often thoughtthat I gave my mother a great deal of provocationBy not marrying according to her desire asked Jean a littlequicklyFarr looked straight in her eyes for a moment before answering drylyThat was certainly a great factor you see Carrie was an heiress andowned a lot of property adjoining oursOh was all Jean said but the monosyllable was most expressiveFarr laughed lightheartedly He had been wrought up by this openingof a longclosed chapter in his life and it was a relief to have thetension relaxedI have never for one instant regretted it and certainly nowYou havent finished your story Jean interrupted with but scantcourtesy please go onThere is not much more to tell and I fear too that I am tiringyou No well I took my mother at her word and from that day to thisI have never darkened her door It came hardest on poor littleClarisse I think he went on sadly she had learned to depend uponme and when she found that I was going to desert her she broke downcompletely It wrung my heart to leave her but it had to be done Inever like to think of that scenePoor Clarisse murmured Jean softlyIt was uphill work at first Farr resumed The lesson of povertywith its grinding necessities was bitter and its bitternessredoubled by experiences that shook my faith in humanity He flungback his head and drew a deep breath Somehow I lived through thatfirst year and then it grew easier a maiden sister of my fathersdied and left me a legacy which though small is yet sufficient forall my needs It is a good many years ago now and I have only seenClarisse once or twice when I have happened to be in Washington inthe winter She is lonely poor little girl but we console each otherby planning the good times we will have in some indefinite futureAfter a moment he began speaking againI know how terrible this must seem to you Miss Jean A man atvariance with his family is at a great disadvantage and after allyou have only heard my side of the story I almost dread gloomilyto have you tell me what you think of me nowOh how unjust you are to me cried Jean indignantly Do you thinkthat your trouble could make any difference to me except to make mesorryoh so sorryfor you and to make me like you and want to beyour friend more than everShe stopped suddenly half frightened by the look in Farrs eyes Hehad grown very pale and he spoke huskilyYou must not be so kind to me you tempt me to tell you whyJean JeanThis piercing cry so fraught with terror brought them to their feetThey started forward and even as they did so Willie stumbled acrossthe doorway and leaned up against the post sobbing piteouslyGladys hurt he panted and then his courage forsaking him heburst into a storm of tearsEvery bit of color faded from Jeans faceWhat do you mean O Willie where is GladysFarr put his hand on the boys shoulderCome little man he said kindly dont cry but take a longbreath There thats a brave little chap Now tell your sister whereGladys is and what has happenedWe were playing birds in a tree and Gladys fell and she cant getup faltered WillieWhere Jean asked sharplyIn the orchardAlmost before the words had passed his lips Jean pushed by him andwas flying toward the orchard Farr stopped a moment to tell Willieto run up to the house and have them send down a couple of pillows tothe orchard and to dispatch a man on horseback for the doctor then hestarted in pursuit of Jean He quickly overtook her and they spedacross the intervening space in silence As they entered the orchardLarrys heartbreaking sobs indicated the scene of the accident and inanother instant Jean had fallen on her knees beside her little sisterThe childs face was drawn and the wide distended eyes werestrangely unnaturally brightGladys precious where does it hurt you But a moan was her onlyanswerOh Mr Farr what can I do How do you suppose she is hurtFarr bent tenderly over little Gladys and laid his hand lightly onher arm A wail of pain escaped from the childs white lips and sheagain lost consciousnessEverything grew black to Jean and she swayed a little leaning againstthe trunk of the tree for support Farrs voice sounded veryindistinct and strange to herCome Miss Jean you must not faint Do you hear me Now take amouthful of this holding out his flask to herJean obeyed him unresistingly and rallied at once the color comingback into her faceGladys has broken her arm he went on in a quiet even voice thatsomehow helped to steady her There that is right Now you look likeyourself againNever mind me she returned resolutely straightening herself Isthere nothing we can do for GladysI sent Willie to the house to tell nurse to come here with pillowsand to send Barnes for the doctor Now give me the flask and put yourarm under her head and raise it a trifle so that I can give her somebrandy There she is coming to nowThe white lids fluttered and Gladys eyes opened slowlyJeanie I twied to fy but I was too little she murmured weaklyand she smiled up at her sister who was bending over her with so muchtendernessThe sound of footsteps reached them and nurse a comfortablemotherlylooking woman bustled up to them her arms laden withpillows and restorativesHer presence brought great reassurance to JeanOh nurse I am so glad you are here Gladys has been hurtMy poor baby Nana will make it all well She shouldnt have left youat all Whatever will Miss Helen sayJeans face contracted sharply and she turned away to hide the tearsthat sprang to her eyes Farr threw an angry glance at nurse who allunconscious of her offense was petting and comforting GladysThis is no time for talking he said We must get Gladys home asquickly as possible Miss Jean will you help me lift herJean recognized the kindly intent in his words and her eyes wereeloquent with gratitudeLittle one he went on to Gladys will you be a good brave littlegirl and let me carry you I will put you on this pillow and I willbe as gentle as possible I cant promise that it wont hurt you somebut when you are once home you will be so comfortableAll right assented Gladys looking up at him with touchingconfidenceBut in spite of all their care it was a very painful ordeal and thepoor child was quite spent before the manor was reached As theymounted the steps of the veranda the doctors gig drove up to thedoor They carried Gladys up to the nursery and Farr lingered therelong enough to hear his opinion confirmed that the child had sustainedno further injury than the breaking of her armI will wait downstairs he said in an undertone to Jean and he wentout and closed the door softly behind himThe moments dragged slowly and he had almost renounced all hope ofseeing Jean again when he heard her footfall on the stair She camedown toward him her white face showing the traces of tears He sprangforward to meet herI cant stay but a moment she said to him for I must go rightback to Gladys The doctor has set her arm and has given her somethingto make her sleep and he is going very soon nowHe laid his hand on her shoulder and looked tenderly down at herYou look worn out Wont you try and rest a littleShe did not resent his action but she moved a step away from him andhis hand dropped at his side Her lips quiveredI dont care about myself I shall never never forgive myself for mywicked thoughtlessness That poor babys suffering haunts meI wont have you blame yourself he declared vehemently I was moreat fault than you for I claimed your attention with my stupid storyDont talk nonsense she returned gently but nevertheless herface lost much of its miseryThey were silent for a moment The past hour had broken down the lastbarrier of reserve between them and had drawn them very close to eachother Of the two Farr was perhaps the more conscious of the subtlechange that had been wrought and he was filled with unspeakable joyYou must go now Jean told him but you will come back tomorrowwont you She was so sure of his answer that she did not wait forhim to speak I dont know how to thank you for all you have done forGladysand me she added very lowIf I have been the least help to you Jean it is more he beganwhen the outer door was pushed open and Nathalie rushed in like awhirlwindWhat in the world has happened she cried excitedly Larry saysthat Gladys is hurt but he is too frightened to be clear about itJean hastened to give her an account of the accident shrinking back alittle from the light that streamed in from the open doorway for fearof what her telltale face might reveal to Nathalies keen eyes Farrbade them goodby and went away and then the two girls went directlyto the nurseryCHAPTER XMISS STUARTS ARRIVALOn this selfsame day after a two hours trip on the cars Helen foundherself at length at her destination It was somewhat after three whenshe stood ringing the frontdoor bell of a substantial brownstonehouse in a quiet side street The city seemed hot indeed after thedewy freshness of the country and the suns rays beat relentlesslyupon the stone flagging and cobblestones The rumblings of carriagesand wagons rolling by the tinkling of the far off carbells theconstant roar of the great city fell strangely upon the girls ears sounaccustomed to the ceaseless din Just then a street vender passedby his shrill voice crying now and again Peaches peaches tencents a quart Helen watched him pityingly until her attention wasattracted by a handorgan grinding away White wings they never growweary Two poor little urchins sat on a neighboring doorstep pitchingpennies their small pale faces making her heart ache as she wonderedwhat a glimpse of green fields and winding lanes would be to them Afeeling of sadness assailed her as these sights and sounds sofamiliar to city life awakened within her a realization that outsideof her sheltered life lay so many full of sorrow and suffering Herreverie was cut short by the appearance of the maid who immediatelyushered her into the darkened drawingroom Between the closedshutters crept a few rays of straggling sunlight which fell upon thefurniture in its muslin slips the bronzes and gas jets in theirwrappings of tarlatanHelen had hardly found a seat when someone hastily descended thestairs and pushing open the door made a rush across the room andthrew her arms about herYou dear girl Miss Stuart cried how glad I am to see you and howgood of you to come You cannot imagine how overjoyed I was when Ireceived your telegramBut I wanted to come Lillian You do not seem to take that intoconsideration Then after a pause Ah how lovely you look butthen it seems to me you invariably doHelen was right for Miss Stuart gowned in a dainty peignoir of whitesilk covered with filmy lace looked especially charmingAt the compliment she laughed softly and pinched Helens cheekThere is no curing you is there dear I thought perhaps aseparation from me might have improved youBut you must not expect it Helen maintained navely unless yougrow less prettyMiss Stuart kissed her warmly Let us talk sense now she saidreprovingly Were you surprised at my message I must explain I wasobliged to come down for mamma on a matter of business and as it wastoo long a trip to return again to Bar Harbor today I thought itbetter to rest and remain overnight in townAnd do you go back tomorrowWell no not if you will take me to Hetherford with youIndeed I will with the greatest pleasureAnd you are quite sure it is convenient now I did not expect to bewith you until the middle of August but being obliged to come down atthis time I thought perhaps I had better go to you at once for myvisit Later I have several others to pay and do not know that Icould manage then to get to Hetherford at allI am delighted to have you at once Lillian you could not come toosoon to please me and you can always be sure of a welcome at themanorYes with you but I am not so sure of those sisters of yoursHelen flushed Pray dont say thatAh my dear dont let it trouble you I rest quite content in youraffectionBut whatever there was in Miss Stuarts words or tone a shadow restedon Helens face for some little while afterwardPerhaps Lillian Stuart saw it for by and by she began to speakagain of the manorYou have no idea Helen how much I long to see your lovely home norwith what pleasure I look forward to being with you dearestYou are good to say so Lillian and I will do all in my power tomake you happyYou will not have to try dear I am sureMiss Stuart rose and touched a bell A quiet middleaged womananswered itMrs Perkins Miss Lawrence remains with me overnight See thatdinner is prepared for usYes MissWait Perkins I want you to send Virginie to meIn a moment the French maid was knocking on the doorVirginie preparez la chambre voisine de la mienne et portezy lesac de Mlle LawrenceWhen the girls at length were seated in Miss Stuarts pretty boudoirthey fell into a long and pleasant chat finding much to say to oneanother after several months separationBy and by Miss Stuart presented a programme for the evening sayingNow Helen you little puritan dont dare to find fault orcriticise My cousin Harry Stuart is going to take us to thetheater and it will be perfectly charming He is almost like abrother to me and there could not be the slightest impropriety initHelen did not demur then but after returning from the theater and inlooking back over the evening she felt some misgivings Harryproved to be a gay scatterbrained youth more or less in love withhis beautiful cousin He stared a little curiously at Helen on beingpresented and then devoted himself exclusively to Miss Stuart whomhe treated with a lack of deference a familiarity which Helen hotlyresented Miss Stuart however was apparently quite oblivious of itand flirted with him openly exchanging glances of amusement withhim as Helens face grew graver and graverA chance remark of his which unfortunately reached Helens ears didnot tend to soften her judgment of himWho is your little friend coz She is tremendously respectable anddoesnt approve of us at allHelen retired to her room that night in a frame of mind to findserious fault with her fascinating friendMiss Stuart realized that she had gone a little too far anddetermined to overcome the impression she had made She well knew thepower that her great beauty exerted over Helen blinding her to faultsthat he who ran might read so she coiled her mass of auburn hair mostbecomingly slipped on a dainty pale blue wrapper encased her feet inslippers of the same hue and presented herself in Helens room andproceeded to make herself so charming and agreeable that in tenminutes Helen had completely forgotten her grievanceThe following morning at an early hour they left for HetherfordHelen neglected to wire Jean of their change of plan so no carriagemet them at the station and they were obliged to rumble up to themanor in the old Hetherford stageHelens heart sank when Jean ran down to the veranda to tell her ofGladys accidentYou cannot imagine how I felt Helen for I knew it was all my faultI should not have forgotten her for one momentIndeed I think you were very careless Jean Helen spoke sharplyfor her anxiety made her nervous and irritableJean had gone forward and shaken hands with Miss Stuart but at thesewords she turned abruptly away She felt so reproached and woebegoneIt almost seemed to her that all the world must know how completelyabsorbed she had been in that sweet talk with Farr to have allowedher mind to wander from the little sister In this guilty anddepressed state of mind her welcome to Miss Stuart somewhat lackedcordiality and the latter who had never liked Jean found herself nowhit better pleasedNathalie came flying down the stairs making a fortunate diversionNow Helen dont scold Jean for she is heartbroken Gladys is doingsplendidly and will be about in a few days How do you do MissStuart I am very glad to see you and so sorry that our anxiety aboutGladys is making us forget to make you at home Please let me takeyour bag and come right up to your old quartersHelen looked gratefully at her sister and Miss Stuarts mannerrelaxed under this warm cordiality and she followed Nathalie up toher roomJean went out upon the veranda and walked slowly up and down Herthoughts which for a moment had been diverted flew swiftly back toFarr He had not spoken the words yet she knew he loved her Shetrembled a little startled at the depth of emotion this knowledgearoused in her So this was lovethis sudden wild beating of herheart this passionate joy of livingPoor fellow she thought with yearning tenderness how much he hassufferedIt was a blessed comfort to feel that it lay within her power to helpto brighten his lonely loveless life She stood quite still andclasped her hands tightly together I love him I love him Theunspoken words sent the blood to her cheeks and she was filled withdismay She roused herself abruptly from her dream and hastenedupstairs to join Helen in the nurseryThat day seemed interminable to Jean When the long afternoon had wornaway and Farr had not come she consoled herself with the thought thatthe evening would surely bring him She tried to curb her impatienceby filling the slowfooted moments with manifold unnecessary dutiesbut it seemed to her that the happy time would never comeThey were all very quiet at dinner for Helen was listening for theslightest sound from the nursery while Jeans absorbing thoughts heldher tongue in chainsWell well cried Nathalie at last what will Miss Stuart think ofus No doubt that this is the home of the Sphinx Our silence isgrowing gruesomeThus recalled to her duties as hostess Helen glanced quickly at herfriend and was distressed to see the expression of cold disdain thatrested on her faceI beg your pardon Lillian she said penitently leaning forwardand taking Miss Stuarts hand I am so upset about Gladys that I haveforgotten my mannersPray dont apologize Helen It is of no consequence whatever MissStuart spoke with studied indifference and withdrew her hand Shedeemed it only her right to be first with her friends always and underall circumstances and to have Helen adoring subservient Helenrelegate her to a position of secondary importance was an offensewhich merited instant punishmentJean and Nathalie on the alert for any slight to their sisterexchanged significant glancesHelen made no further demonstration of affection but began to talkgently and courteously to her guest Jean and Nathalie came valiantlyto her assistance until at last Miss Stuart was forced to respond totheir friendly overtures When they were leaving the dining room sheslipped her hand into Helens arm It was the nearest approach to anapology of which her nature was capable and Helen had fain to becontent All her life Miss Stuart had been in the habit of snubbingpeople at her own sweet will and had found it a diverting occupationbut somehow it hurt her to snub Helen the girl was always so patientand generous about itThey drifted quite naturally out onto the veranda The sky wasovercast and a faint wind sighed among the trees The heavy cloudspromised rain and the earth after reveling in days of sunshine andnights of brilliant beauty seemed wrapped in melancholy submissionBefore very long Nan and Emily came running across the lawn Nangreeted Miss Stuart cordially but Emily was very cool and lookedaskance at this dangerously beautiful addition to their circle Whenshe had shaken hands she faced the girls as solemn as a judgeGirls what do you suppose has happened The Vortex has gone awayand those miserable men never came to say goodby and did not evensend a lineNow see here Emily Nan interposed warmly I dont believe inbeing unjust It must have been a sudden move and of course we willhear from themIt is a great shame complained Nathalie What shall we do withourselvesAt Emilys first words Jean started forward then fell back in herchair dazed and stunned She pressed her hand against her heart tostay its loud throbbing passionately grateful that the kindlydarkness sheltered her from view She could not tell how long it mighthave been when she was aroused by a sentence from Emily which arrestedher attentionYes it is such a pretty stitch Ill teach it to you some dayHelenHad she heard aright Could it be possible that the Vortex wasalready forgottenits officers banished to the indifferent past Hersudden excitement died away and a dull feeling of pain tugged at herheart Her hands dropped nervelessly into her lap and her lids closedwearily over her aching eyesThe conversation drifted into local channels and Miss Stuart wasbeginning to feel very much bored when Eleanor and Cliff sauntered upthe driveway and joined the party She awaked from her apathy tosurvey Cliff critically and then proceeded to monopolize hisattention Cliff dropped into a chair beside her and lent himselfreadily to her plan She was a charming woman a beautiful woman sohe assumed his most devoted manner and apparently succumbed at onceto her gracious subtle flattery Eleanor cast an amused glance at himover her shoulder she felt too sure of him to be disturbed andpushing her way among the group until she reached Jeans sideI met Johnnie Matthews at the gate dear He was on his way to themanor with a note for you and since it required no answer Ivolunteered to bring it upThanks Eleanor I suppose Mrs Matthews wants me to take her classagain next Sunday She has been illEleanor had dropped the note into Jeans lap and was moving away butsomething in her friends voice startled her She looked at hercuriously but in that light she could not discern her expression Shehesitated a moment and then sat down on the arm of Jeans chairHow is Gladys tonight she askedJean made an effort to speak more naturallyVery comfortable thank you The doctor says her arm is doing nicelyand so far she has not had any feverEleanor did you know the Vortex had goneAs Nathalie spoke Eleanor impulsively took Jeans hand in hers It wasvery cold and trembled in her clasp Jeans unhappiness wasexplained and at the same moment another idea flashed through hermind She answered Nathalie with wellfeigned lightnessIt cant be more than a temporary absence I am sure Then added ina lower tone to Jean Dont you want to read your note dearie Itmay not be from Mrs MatthewsJean gave a start and instinctively her disengaged hand closed overthe note in her lapI think I will take it to the lightShe rose hurriedly and made her way to the doorway where the lightfrom the lamp fell upon her letter The handwriting was unfamiliarand Jeans heart seemed to stand still as she tore open the envelopeThe opening words dispelled the last doubt her whole expressionchanged and she eagerly drank in the contents of the sheet allunconscious of the pair of eyes that were watching her narrowlyNothing escaped Miss Stuart She saw plainly the sudden start therising color the tremulous happiness in the young girls facePerhaps the sight stirred some strange memory deep hidden in herheart for she smiled bitterly and answered some pleasantry ofCliffs with such stinging cynicism that even that languid youth wasaroused to retortBut to Jean the whole world was forgotten as she read the lines     MY DEAR MISS LAWRENCE     It is with deep regret I write you that the Vortex has     been ordered up the Sound to survey a certain locality Most     unfortunately our orders came very late We have only just     time to catch the tide by weighing anchor at once I do not     know whether you realize how great is my disappointment at     leaving Hetherford or how great is my regret at not seeing     you before I go Our stay I trust will not extend beyond a     week and I look forward with great pleasure to the time     when we once more cast anchor in your harbor I shall be     anxious for news of little Gladys and if I did not fear to     presume I should ask you to write me Perhaps your goodness     of heart will prompt you to forgive and indulge me at the     same time My address will be F which is the     postoffice nearest to our anchorage     Yours faithfully     VALENTINE FARRJean raised her eyes and let them rest on the group of people outsidethe doorway No one apparently had a thought for her for MissStuart had discreetly withdrawn her gaze and they one and all seemedabsorbed in the merry conversation She longed to slip away to her ownroom that she might be alone with her happy thoughts but pausedirresolute wondering as she crumpled the note in her hand if itwould be unpardonably rude to leave her guests thus abruptly Helencame to her rescueJean will you please go up and see if Gladys is asleepJean nodded her head in assent and gladly disappeared Eleanor lookedafter her with a kindly smile yet she sighed a littlenotwithstandingWhat would Nan do if she knew this she thoughtShortly afterward a servant came to the door bringing word that MissGladys was sleeping soundly and that Miss Jean begged to be excusedas she had a headacheIn the night the rain fell heavily and the rising wind sighed andsobbed like a child in pain but Jeans dreams were sweet and herlast sleeping and first waking thoughts were of Valentine FarrCHAPTER XIDULL DAYSThe days that followed were the quietest that this summer had broughtto Hetherford Not only had the Vortex gone but Wendell andChurchill had carried the other men off on the Sylph for alongplanned fishing excursion and the girls were left to their owndevices This was too common an occurrence to be looked upon as agreat hardship yet it was quite obvious even to Nan that they didnot revel so much in their once treasured independence and that theoldtime simple pleasures had somehow lost their zest There wassomething strangely amiss in the little colony Jean who had alwaysbeen depended upon to set the ball rolling and to keep everyone ingood spirits failed them utterly She was so quiet and absentmindedso unlike her usual self that Eleanor began to fear that her surmisesin regard to the letter had been incorrect after all Miss Stuartspresence at the manor acted as a great restraint upon everybody Shedid not adapt herself in the least to their quiet humdrum existenceand maintained a stoical silence that was especially irritating Theweather was very depressing A fine drizzling rain fell persistentlythe sky was gray and leaden and the roads and lanes were almostimpassable with the mud The dampness retarded Gladys recovery andshe was fractious and troublesome Poor Helen was in despair for MissStuart was unreasonable enough to resent her spending so much time inthe nursery and took small pains to conceal the fact that she wasalmost bored to deathBy Friday Aunt Helen was seriously fretting over her niece for Helenwas looking pale and tired and seemed quite incapable of coping withthe anxieties of housekeeping Gladys and the entertainment of herdifficult friendOn the afternoon of this day the rain ceased and Nathalie in despairof any more interesting amusement declared her intention to drive tothe station to see the express arriveNot that anyone ever comes here she said dolorously as she drew onher driving glovesAn hour later she burst into the drawingroom her face radiant hereyes twinkling Helen sat before the low teatable serving tea MissStuart lounged in a huge armchair while Jean was on her way betweenthe teatable and Miss Stuart with a dainty cup in her hand Shepaused and looked expectantly at NathalieWell cheer up girls for I have some news at last Who do you thinkarrived todayEven Miss Stuart leaned forward in her chair and lost something ofher air of languorDont ask tiresome riddles Nathalie pleaded Jean but tell usMrs ArcherMiss Stuart looked blank Helen laughed softly and Jean handed MissStuart her cup of tea with a disgusted expression on her bonny faceYou must indeed be in the depths to call that good news she saidscornfullyI didnt say good news I said news Nathalie retorted triumphantlyand in any case I think Mrs Archer is a godsend after the monotonyof the last few daysMiss Stuart smiled faintly for Nathalie but echoed her sentimentsI think Cliffs mother is a charming woman interposed Helen Sheis somewhat overbearing and imposing but I know she does not mean tobe disagreeableI like her maintained Nathalie She is so worldly so thoroughlymagnificentJean laughed and meekly took her cup of tea from HelenI have not another word to say I suppose the truth is that I ammortally afraid of Mrs Archer She completely subdues meAfter a moment she spoke again from the comfortable place she hadtaken on the divanDo you know Nathalie just for one moment I thought it might havebeen Guy of whom you were speakingHelen set the teapot down suddenly and there was a momentsuncomfortable silence Miss Stuart let her glance travel slowly fromHelens flushed face to Jeans grave oneAre you speaking of Mr Appleton she asked lazilyYes replied Jean with perfect unconsciousness I suppose you methim at the same time you did Helen I wish it had been he instead ofMrs ArcherMiss Stuart shrugged her shoulders and answered with insolentdisregard of Jeans evident affection for GuyA nice enough man in his way but so deadly uninteresting so lackingin that knowledge of the world which alone makes a man worth talkingtoJeans eyes flashed and her voice trembled with angerMr Appleton is a very dear friend of ours Miss Stuart and to noneof us is it agreeable to hear him spoken ill ofShe looked impulsively across at Helen feeling sure that her sisterwould speak some word of vindication of Guy but the girls head wasbent and she seemed wholly occupied in pushing the teacups aimlesslyabout on the polished surface of the mahogany teatable For the firsttime in her life Jean felt a contempt for her sister and pressed herlips tightly together to keep down the bitter words that rose to themNathalie who hated a scene above all things and yet was toothoroughly in sympathy with Jean to feel equal to changing theconversation sat down at the piano and began to drumMiss Stuart looked from one to the other and laughed unpleasantlyMr Appleton should be proud of such an ardent championJean made no answer She finished her tea in silence and then leftthe room followed by a sneering glance from Miss Stuarts eyesThat evening Mrs Andrews and her sister Mrs Archer called at themanor The young people had taken advantage of the first clear eveningsince Miss Stuarts arrival and had gone for a walk so Mrs Dennisasked her guests up to her room During the conversation Mrs AndrewssaidHow badly Helen is looking latelyAunt Helen agreed with her and related to Mrs Archer the facts ofGladys accident and dilated upon Helens untiring devotion to herlittle sisterShe is worn out she sighed in conclusion and it is so hard forher to have Miss Stuart here just at presentYou dont mean Lillian Stuart that beautiful girl about whomeveryone is raving exclaimed Mrs Archer roused to a degree ofinterest she rarely felt when in HetherfordI suppose it is the same She is certainly very beautiful butsomehow and Aunt Helens face grew puzzled she doesnt seem at allthe kind of girl my Helen should care for However they are closefriends so IOh she is a great belle Mrs Archer interrupted brusquely Poorgirl What in the world does she do with herself in thisoutoftheway placeMrs Andrews replied with some heatShe must be very hard to please if she cannot find anything to amuseor interest her hereA gleam of amusement flashed into Aunt Helens eyes but was instantlysuppressed Hetherford was the basis of an old feud between thesisters and had been the cause of more than one bitter quarrel MrsArcher was a fashionable woman to the tips of her fingers and foryears she had striven to impress her easygoing sister with theimportance of society and to persuade her at least to spend hersummers in some resort more frequented by the world of society MrsAndrews however stood out against her and stoutly maintained thatshe and her children were perfectly happy where they were and MrsArcher had to content herself with an occasional visit from her nieceMollie who was eminently unsatisfactory as a fashionable girl Tocrown her displeasure her only son Clifford instead of findingpleasure in his charming home at Newport insisted upon spending thesummer at Hetherford Inn and Mrs Archer bore a great grudge againstthis small place She was a very hospitable woman and enjoyed keepingopen house but she found it a great drawback to have no young personat homeAs she rose to leave it suddenly occurred to her that it would bevery delightful to take two of the girls back to Newport with her Herchoice fell upon Helen because in that way she could include MissStuart in the invitation Mrs Dennis met the suggestion withapproval for she knew it would do Helen good to get away from homefor a few days and that so pleasant a change would please MissStuart In the midst of the discussion the two girls walked into theroomMrs Archers shrewd worldly eyes took in every detail of MissStuarts beautiful face and faultless gown and she instantly droppedthe somewhat patronizing tone she had used toward Helen and urgedtheir acceptance with great cordiality Helen hesitated for she wasloath to leave Gladys again but Aunt Helen and Miss Stuart overruledall her objections and it was agreed that they should accompany MrsArcherThe quiet that settled down over the manor after their departure wasvery grateful to Jean who during the past week had been disturbed andharassed She knew that she was fast approaching the most seriouscrisis of her life All during these joyous summer days she haddrifted on so happily evading selfquestionings living only for theday Now she realized that the drifting was at an end On his returnValentine Farr would speak to her and although she had no doubt as tothe answer she would give him yet she trembled a little and wouldfain have been alone with her secret And now when she would have hadher whole mind dominated by this one thought Miss Stuarts unwelcomepresence in the house thrust other and less pleasant thoughts uponher Up to the time of this last visit Jeans dislike of Miss Stuarthad been a vague passing sentiment which had concerned her butlittle She had distrusted her always but even that distrust waspurely intuitive for she had no idea of the part Miss Stuart hadplayed in the severing of Helens engagement In that slightcontroversy about Guy however Jean had unwittingly pierced beneaththe surface of Miss Stuarts suave manner and had caught a glimpse ofthe girls true nature She could not understand why this shouldaffect her so strongly In vain she tried to account for it toherself Miss Stuart although so dear a friend of Helens occupied acomparatively unimportant position in their home life In anotherfortnight she would be gone from among them and for months they wouldknow nothing of her save what Helen might choose to communicate fromher oft received letters So Jean argued with herself battling with acurious sense of apprehension that struggled within her She longed totalk it all over with Aunt Helen whose judgment was always to betrusted but that seemed a kind of disloyalty to Helen so shesmothered the vague doubts and fears which threatened to overwhelm herusual good sense Her thoughts flew off to Farr and poised over thatstrange talk they had had on that last afternoon She drew from herpocket a letter that had come from him and read it over slowlylingering over every sentence But when she had finished and wasfolding it into its envelope again she sighed a little for even thatdear missive could not quite dispel the vision which haunted her ofLillian Stuarts beautiful cruel faceCHAPTER XIIEDDYING CURRENTSMonday dawned bright and clear When Jean awoke the sunlight wasflooding the room and through the open window came the sweet voicesof the birds as they merrily chirped and sang As she sprang out ofbed she was filled with a sense of wellbeing and happiness She couldeven find it in her heart to laugh a little scornfully at the fanciesthat had disturbed her for they had vanished with the vanishingclouds She dressed hurriedly and ran down to the dining room with asnatch of song upon her lips By her plate on the breakfast table layan envelope addressed in a mans legible handwriting She flushed asshe caught it up and crossed to the window to read it Farr hadwritten in great haste to say that the Vortex would be in HetherfordHarbor by noon on Monday When Jean had reached that point in his noteshe read no further She stood very still her hands holding the bitof paper closely her breath coming hurriedly through her slightlyparted lips For one moment thusthen the maid entered bearing thecoffee urn Larry clattered noisily into the room and Jean turnedback to the ordinary duties of everyday life But her face was stillillumined and in the depths of her shining eyes lingered thereflection of her souls great happinessDuring the morning a telegram came from Helen saying that she and MissStuart would arrive by the afternoon express Jean had just terminateda long interview with the cook and was frowning portentously over herunusual duties as housekeeper when Nathalie brought her the news Shemade a grimace and then proceeded to inform Nathalie of theapproaching arrival of the Vortex subduing as best she could thetremor of excitement in her voice Nathalie was jubilant At last thedull days were at an end and they would start on a new round offestivities While she was chattering volubly it suddenly occurred toJean that it would be a pleasant welcome to Helen and Miss Stuart toask Mr Dudley and Farr to dinner She made the suggestion timidlyfor she feared that Nathalie would divine the true motive whichprompted her Her mind was instantly set at rest for Nathalieoverjoyed at the break in the monotony gave her a friendly pushtoward the desk to hasten the writing of the notes Jean laughinglyreminded her that the Vortex had not yet arrived and then they puttheir two heads together to concoct a dinner which should quite equalone of Helens orderingThat afternoon as they were about starting for the station Barnesbrought back the answer from the Vortex Farrs was of so gratefuland rejoicing a nature that Jean laughed lightheartedly as she readit It came to her suddenly as they were bowling along the highroadthat in her note to him she had not mentioned the fact that MissStuart was with them nor had she done so in the one letter she hadwritten him during his absenceIt was just an oversight she said to herself A mere chanceA mere chance and yet chance sometimes means fateHelen met them with so many questions about Gladys the boys and AuntHelen that Jean had no opportunity to unfold her plan for dinneruntil Miss Stuart had gone to her room and she had followed hersister into the nursery Helen was tired and travelworn but she wasdelighted by Jeans thoughtfulness for Lillians pleasure andlistened interestedly while her sister anxiously submitted the menufor her approvalEverything is perfect dear she said putting Gladys down from herlap and making her way out into the hall but before I go to dress Imust tell Lillian that we are to have guests to dinner and sheturned away without noting the shadow that crossed Jeans face at themention of Miss Stuarts nameMiss Stuart stood before her dressingtable arranging the silvertoilet articles which she had just taken from her trunk She hadthoroughly enjoyed her stay at Newport and was feeling in a goodhumor with all the world She turned a bright glance of inquiry as thedoor opened to admit Helen and betrayed a ready interest in herfriends announcementWho are the menTwo officers from the Coast Survey schooner that is anchored hereMr Dudley and Mr Farr Valentine FarrThe little vinaigrette Miss Stuart held in her hand dropped on thedressingtable Her face contracted sharply and she made a quickinstinctive movement away from the lightValentine Farr she repeated slowly keeping her voice well undercontrol It must be the same of courseDo you know him Helen asked the question absentmindedly for shewas looking about her critically to assure herself that everything inthe room was as it should beOh yes I have known him for a long while She had quite recoveredfrom her surprise and spoke lightly in her usual tone What a smallworld it is after allDinner at seven Lillian Helen said to her as she closed the doorand then she was aloneSo Val is here she murmured Val of all people in the world Sheflung back her head with a reckless laugh and began to pace up anddown the roomA flood of recollections swept over her recollections which stirredher with a strange emotion How long ago it seemed sincesunnytempered strongwilled Val Farr had wooed her in so masterful away What folly it had been and yet a sweet folly withal Miss Stuartpaused midway in the room Her face softened and her beautiful mouthdrooped tenderly She had craved a splendid future which Val couldnot give her so she had thrust his love out of her heart and filledits place with the admiration and exactions of the gay world in whichshe moved Vals misfortunes his poverty and his estrangement fromhis family gave her the opportunity which she sought to jilt him Shefrowned with vexation as she recalled the look of scorn that he hadcast at her when she had laid bare to him the aims and ambitions towhich she had sacrificed their love And after all it had been auseless needless exposure for Val had come to her to give her herfreedom She told herself that she had acted wisely she laughed toscorn the sentiment that was so hard to stiflebut no other man hadever taken Vals placeThey had met from time to time in Washington during the past fewyears and at each fresh meeting Farr had found himself more and moredisillusioned concerning the woman whom he had once loved Somethingof this Lillian Stuart divined with a bitterness of spirit which shecould not quell His indifference stung her to the quick and shecould not renounce the hope that she might win him back if onlycircumstances would give her the opportunity Miss Stuarts thoughtsbrought her back to the present She drew her brows together andstared meditatively before her with eyes that saw nothing of the roomaround herI wonder if Val is in love with one of these girls and if so whichoneJean Lawrences face flashed before her She struck her hands sharplytogether and an angry light gleamed in her eyesThat would be a curious way of punishing me I have always detestedthat sister of HelensShe crossed to the mirror and gazed critically at the picturepresented there A smile slow and cruel touched her lips and with asatisfied air of triumph she turned away and began to dress fordinnerThe hands of the little French clock on the mantel were close uponseven when a knock came at the door and Helen entered She startedback with a faint gasp of admiration as Miss Stuart turned from thedressingtable and swept across the room to meet herO Lillian she cried how beautiful you look but my dear youwill take away my guests breath You know we are thoroughly informalat HetherfordMiss Stuart raised her hands to clasp a string of pearls about herthroat with slow deliberationI am very sorry she said distantly that my gown does not meetwith your approval I can easily change itWhy Lillian I find your gown charming and would not have you changeit for the world I exclaimed simply because I did not expect to seeyou en grande toiletteIt did not occur to me that I was inappropriately dressed but ofcourse I am not conversant with your customs hereThe covert sneer was not lost upon Helen and she flushed painfully atthe sharp words With her usual selfdepreciation she felt reproachedfor what she considered her lack of tact and courtesyI dont know how to tell you how sorry I am Lillian she murmuredwith deep contrition for my inadvertent speech I never knew you tolook lovelier Wont you please believe me when I tell you thatThe navet of the compliment touched Miss Stuart and she smiledgayly into Helens troubled eyesI admit that I did not understand you at first I thought that I wasguilty of a social error However it is all right nowHelen put her hand on her shoulder and turned her gently aroundI want to really see your gown It is exquisite What perfect tasteyou have LillianMiss Stuarts gown was of the palest shade of green velvet made sosimply as to be almost severe in its lines The lowcut bodice wasornamented with some fine cut jet and a little dagger of the same wasthrust through the soft coil of auburn hair which crowned her smalland shapely head Her neck and arms shone dazzlingly fair and thecontour of the firm white throat would have delighted the eyes of anartist The long straight lines of her gown accentuated her heightwhich was somewhat above the average and she carried herself withregal graceHelen gazed at her a moment in silent admiration She absolutelyworshiped beauty and its power over her was very great Had anyonehinted to her that it was chiefly this in Miss Stuart which so charmedher she would have indignantly refuted the accusation and yet in agreat measure it was true Many and many a time she had cause topuzzle over her friendaye almost to distrust and fear her but thepower of the girls great beauty blinded her and left her helpless tocondemn one who possessed such infinite attractionThe silence lasted but a moment yet Miss Stuart had read Helensverdict in her transparent face and her pulses quickened withtriumphant hopeWell well she cried laughingly at length are you spellboundand have you forgotten your guestsHelen cast a hurried glance at the clockWhy it is seven I must run down at once Follow me as soon as youcan dearDown in the drawingroom Jean was wandering restlessly about tooexcited to keep still for one moment She wore the simplest of hergowns but one which Farr had once told her he liked Jean was almostwithout vanity but tonight as she passed the long mirror over themantel she could not refrain from glancing therein She was countingthe slowfooted moments and at every turn her eyes consulted the oldDutch clock in the corner At last a carriage drove up the graveledroad there were steps upon the veranda and the front door opened andclosed again She longed to run out into the hall but an overwhelmingshyness deterred her and even as she halted irresolute theportires were pushed apart and as in a dream she saw Farr comingtoward her Her heart beat so she could not trust her voice to speakhim greetingHe caught both her hands in his and held them closelyJean do you know how glad I am to see you again he whisperedSlowly she raised her eyes to meet his The depth of her emotion paledher cheek and her young face wore a look of awe Farrs heart boundedwith joy and he would have spoken but suddenly she flushed crimsonand wrenching her hands from his started forward to meet Dudley whostood in the doorway uncertain whether to advance or beat a retreatJean covered her embarrassment as best she could although Dudleytried valiantly to put her at her ease there was a merry twinkle inhis blue eyes which she found very disconcerting At that moment Helenand Nathalie made their entrance and Jean moved a little apart fromthe others struggling to regain her selfpossessionFarr had turned to appeal to her for confirmation of some statementwhen a sudden lull fell upon the buzz of conversation Miss Stuartstood in the doorway her brilliant figure strikingly set against thedark background of the dimly lighted hallway She surveyed them for abrief instant with apparent nonchalance but that brief glance toldher that it was with Jean that Farr was talking With slow grace shecrossed the room and gained Helens sideFarrs eyes followed Jeans and as they reached Miss Stuart hisexpression underwent a sudden change She was looking directly at himand smiled faintly at the dismay in his faceWell Mr Farr is it so great a surprise to you to see such an oldfriend in HetherfordFarr recovered himself instantly and met her challenging glance withan impenetrable smileIt is indeed an unexpected pleasure Miss Stuart he said withgrave courtesy and Miss Stuart was conscious of feeling curiouslybaffledTo Jean watching them with dilating eyes that apparently meaninglessincident seemed fraught with significance All the haunting doubts andfears that not twelve hours ago she had scorned as morbid fanciesreturned upon her with redoubled force Love which makes us strangelyblind makes us also strangely alert and Jeans eyes had seen thechange in Farrs face and as he spoke those few conventional wordsher quick ears had detected an unnatural ring in his voice MissStuart had called herself an old friend and yet Farr had never spokenof her Jean searched her memory to see if it were possible that shehad never mentioned Miss Stuarts name to him and as she thuspondered a chance sentence of Nathalies reached herYou go through the shrubberyShe heard no more In an instant the scene was clear before herthelong stretch of lawn beyond the shrubbery bright in the silvermoonlight the sound of voices from the parsonage breaking softlyupon the evening stillness through which Farr and she walked slowlyside by side Then she had spoken of Miss Stuart and he had certainlydisclaimed any acquaintance with her Her heart grew cold as her firstdoubt of her lover found lodgment there As if in consummation of herthoughts she looked up to see Farr offer Miss Stuart his arm With asense of foreboding she followed them slowly into the dining roomsmiling a little drearily as she remembered with what eagerness shehad anticipated this dinnerFarrs place at table was between Miss Stuart and Jean and as theytook their seats he spoke to the latter in a carefully lowered toneYou cant imagine how delightful it is to be here again I wasabsolutely homesick for the manor while I was awayIndeed How unhappy you must have beenI was he replied gravely observing for the first time the girlsair of disdain and wondering at the cause thereof and I shall havea new cause for sorrow if you look at me as you are now doingJeans levity was somewhat forced as she repliedI am very sorry you are not pleased I do not find it easy to changemy expressionNo He bent a very direct and earnest gaze upon her Why MissJean he said softly I thought we were friends when I went awayand only tonight you seemed glad at my returnThe last spark of resentment died out of Jeans heart Her distrust ofhim seemed suddenly both groundless and foolish Ashamed and contriteshe was about to speak when Miss Stuarts suave voice broke in uponthemMr Farr have you heard anything of the Saunders since you leftWashingtonFarr had no alternative but to reply to so direct a question andJean although annoyed at the unwelcome interruption waitedpatiently confident that he would seize upon the first opportunity toresume his conversation with her As the moments passed however andhis undivided attention was still given to Miss Stuart she was firsthurt and then bitterly angry A lump rose in her throat and for onemiserable moment she thought she was going to cry then her pride cameto her rescue and under an almost reckless gayety of speech andmanner she hid her momentary weakness It was unjust and unreasonableto blame Farr but Jean was in no frame of mind for logical argumentHe had turned away from her to speak to Miss Stuart and although shehad given him ample time to take up the broken thread of theirdiscourse he had failed to do so As she talked on excitedly withDudley her cheeks burning her eyes dark and restless she wasmentally comparing herself with Miss Stuart whom she had alreadyalmost unconsciously begun to regard as her rival She had alwaysknown that Helens friend was beautiful but tonight her newlyawakened jealousy caused her to lay great stress on the brilliancy andfascination of their guest She recalled with curious distinctnessthe image of herself which the mirror had shown her while she awaitedFarrs coming and her heart contracted as she thought how colorlessshe must appear in contrast with Miss Stuarts rich and vivid beautyWhen at length Farr was once more at liberty to address her she hadworked herself up to such a pitch of miserable jealousy that she wouldhave none of him and took an almost savage delight in thwarting hisevery attempt at speech with her He was too reserved to let her seehow deeply he was wounded by her flippancy and incivility and in hisapparent indifference Jean found an added proof of his disloyalty andof her own unpardonable folly She had almost come to the end of hercourage when Helen rose giving the signal to the ladies to withdrawHelen sat down before the open piano and Nathalie picked up hermandolin from the music stand and began to tune it When she hadfinished she spoke in a low tone to her sisterLets play Guys old favorite will you dearHelen complied but not before she had cast a halfguilty glanceacross the room to where Miss Stuart was gracefully reclining in ahuge armchair to satisfy herself that the mention of her lovers namehad escaped her friends notice The piano took up the accompanyingstrains of a soft andante the mandolin carrying the air with itstremulous and strangely human wailJean leaned her face on her hand as she nestled down among thecushions on the divan Her good angel was whispering to her in thesweet harmony of the music and gentler thoughts of her lover wereprevailing against the cruel doubts of him which her jealousy hadtaught her After all had not Miss Stuart been chiefly at fault andhad he not honestly striven to make amendsIt is entirely the result of my morbid dislike of that girl shesaid to herself and when the officers came out from the dining roomshe gave Farr a bright glance of welcome and when he had joined hershe talked to him until her persistent gentleness had completelymelted away the barrier of reserve which had crept between them Onceor twice it was on the tip of her tongue to say Why did you nevertell me that you knew Miss Stuart but the words held back by afoolish sentiment of pride never passed her lipsMeanwhile Farr although touched by the sweet friendliness was moredisheartened than he quite cared to own He had allowed his hope togrow too quickly founded on that one honest glance from Jeans eyesa glance so full of love and trust that he had felt he could not bedeceived Scarcely had he told himself that his happiness was assuredwhen Jeans coldness had denied the love which her eyes had bespokenNo suspicion of the truth had crossed his mind and as Jean had neverbeen given to moods he was left to the discouraging conclusion thathe had been too hasty and that she was resenting it She was willingnow to treat him with her oldtime cordial frankness for having onceclearly defined their relative positions she was too courteous tocontinue a course of treatment which she must have seen had greatlypained him Never until he had reached this unhappy decision had herealized how strong and deeprooted was his love for Jean As his eyesrested on her a longing seized him to take her in his arms and tobring back to her face that look which had given him such promise ofjoyHis unexpected meeting with Miss Stuart had brought back to his memorythe foolish impetuosity the passionate unrest of his boyish love forher and he thanked God for the wholesome lesson he had learned andprayed earnestly for the love of this young girl whose truth andsincerity stirred all the dormant possibilities of his higher natureWith these thoughts in his mind his eyes wandered across the room towhere Lillian Stuart sat talking with Dudley He acknowledged theforce and charm of her rare exotic beauty but it moved him not atall Her effective pose was studied and artificial Her face soperfect in contour was lacking in any suggestion of tenderwomanliness and her glorious eyes now raised to Dudleys althoughfull of the power of expression revealed no depth of soulIt was refreshing to him to turn once more to Jean to meet the dearlaughterloving eyes to watch the fleeting changes of expression onher bonny face to mark the unconscious grace of every movement of herlithe slender figure Yet the secret of Jeans strong hold on hisheart lay not in these superficial attractions nor in her franksimplicity of manner nor yet in her girlish freshness which was hergreatest claim to beauty but in the knowledge he had gained of hertrue nature a nature so honest so unfailing in loyalty sounselfish so charitable so responsive in its sympathies that bothrespect and reverence were blended with his love for her And yet hewas not wholly blind to her faults He knew that she was impatient andhottempered and that in anger she was often sarcastic and cuttingbut he also saw that she made a brave effort to hold herself in checkand that however she might be worsted she never ceased to strugglefor the mastery His meditations had carried him far adrift of theconversation but although Jean had observed his abstraction she didnot resent it She was living in a daydream herself a dream that wasall the happier for that miserable hour at the dinnertable She rosewith a regretful sigh when Helen asked her to go up with a message toAunt Helen She looked up at Farr as he held back the portire for herto pass and impulsively put out her hand to himWe are friends again are we not she asked scarcely above herbreathFarr gripped the little hand so tightly it almost hurt herOnly friends Jean was all he said but Jean was satisfiedAunt Helen detained her for some few moments with questions about thedinner and when at last she was free Mary called to her to pleasestep into the nursery for Larry was wakeful and naughty and would notbe quiet Quite a halfhour had passed before she reentered thedrawingroomShe paused on the threshold attracted by Farrs voice He was seatedjust within the doorway His back was turned toward her and he facedMiss Stuart who was leaning slightly forward in her chairYou are mistaken he was saying I remember everything about thatevening to the color of the gown you woreBefore the conclusion of this sentence Miss Stuart had detected Jeanhalf hidden by the heavy portireThose were pleasant days in Washington Val she said accompanyingthe words with a faint sighJean never dreaming that she had been seen retreated precipitatelyto a far corner of the hall and when she once more entered the roomher face was pale but she held her head well up and with a low Ibeg your pardon swept by the two who still maintained theirpositionsThat night Miss Stuarts light burned until a late hour and inresponse to Helens gentle inquiry as to the cause thereof she gavethrough the closed door but a curt GoodnightCHAPTER XIIIAN INVITATIONWednesday brought the return of the Sylph from her cruise The mentanned and burned by exposure to wind and sun were in great spiritsand declared themselves ready for any sport that might be suggestedThe girls rallied forces and in solemn conclave bade them extendtheir vacation one more week that Miss Stuart might be amused andentertained They drew a pathetic picture of her first week inHetherford and maintained that it would be rank disloyalty to allowher to go away with such an impression of the beloved placeIn the confusion of tongues two voices were silent Emily and Jeaneach had her own reason for wishing Miss Stuart a thousand miles awayand both looked a little contemptuous at the excitement that was beingmade over her However their lack of interest did not dampen theenthusiasm of the others and the day was carried The men did notneed a great deal of urging for they had already met Miss Stuart andwere eloquent in their praises of her Dick Andrews succumbed at onceto the tender passion much to everybodys amusement for jolly Dickin the rle of lovesick swain was a most diverting spectacleAndrews did not have it all his own way however for Miss Stuartwith an exception in Farrs favor treated them quite impartially Itwas conceded that Farr as an old friend had a prior right and noone marveled that Miss Stuarts manner toward him was particularlygracious and amiable They were much in each others society and sodiplomatic was Miss Stuart that no one discerned that their frequentttettes were invariably of her planningIt must be said however that Farr made no resistance and appearedeminently at ease with her He was sorely wounded and as angry withJean as it was possible for him to be and in this dejected andunenviable frame of mind he took small heed of what he did with histime Monday night when at Helens request Jean had left thedrawingroom she had distinctly bade him hope One hour later shehad again veered round and had treated him with a contemptuousindifference which he felt he had in no way deserved Even then he hadtried to believe that his imagination was at fault but when she hadpurposely overlooked the hand which he had extended to her in partinghe could no longer deceive himself Unfortunately Miss Stuart hadseen the slight which Jean had put upon him and the faint smile ofamusement in her eyes when she had said goodnight to him butdeepened the sting In a tempest of rage he flung himself out of thehouse and strode furiously down the avenue leaving poor Dudley farbehind to wonder what on earth was the matterIt was not easy for Farr with his nature to forgive a repulse and onTuesday he kept to the Vortex nursing his wrongs and vowing hewould take no step to make matters right between them until Jeanshould show some sign of penitence By Wednesday this determinationwas less firm and during the hours of his work and leisure his heartwas pleading for Jean When evening came he gave up the struggle andat nine oclock presented himself at the manorThe light that streamed out through the open door and windows revealedquite a number of people on the veranda and he remembered that he hadobserved the Sylph riding at anchor in the harbor They gave him ahearty welcome and while Nathalie was rallying him for his unkinddesertion of them he vainly tried to discover Jeans whereabouts Hisinability to do so was soon explainedWhere did Jean go Nathalie askedEleanor answered from the corner of the verandaShe went in the house a little while agoSend Susie up for her Nathalie Helen requestedFarr took a seat on the railing at a point which commanded a view ofthe hall and found himself face to face with Miss Stuart who wastilting slowly back and forth in a deep rocker They had interchangedone or two commonplace remarks when a maid tripped across the hall andstood in the doorwayMiss Jean begs to be excused she announced briefly and disappearedinto the darkened dining room beyondFarr drew a quick breath and a frown contracted his brows He couldscarcely believe that he had heard aright With a characteristicgesture he pulled his cap down over his eyes and set his teeth MissStuart remembered the trick of old She watched him furtively with acurious light in her eyes Suddenly he recalled her existence butwhen he looked at her she had already averted her gaze and wasapparently quite unconscious that anything of importance had takenplaceShe gave him a few moments in which to recover himself and thenaddressed to him some passing observation on a subject quite alien toHetherford or the Hetherford girls Farr animated by a strong desireto hide his pain and disappointment from every eye braced himself andreplied in a vein of lightness which satisfied her that she had beenwise in the course which she had adopted They drifted quite naturallyinto conventional smalltalk and every moment he gained moreassurance and ease He was positively grateful for Miss Stuartspresence for it afforded him a refuge from intercourse with thosesimplehearted Hetherford girls which he felt would just now bevery disastrous to his selfcontrol No thought of danger assailedhim He believed Miss Stuarts sentiment for him to be quite dead andas for himself he had so completely outlived every trace of his boyishpassion as to have even lost all feeling of resentment against her Hecongratulated himself with true masculine density that he had probedthe depths of Miss Stuarts nature and could never be outwitted byher again Some day if things went well with him he meant to tellJean all about that affair in fact he would have done so Mondayevening had he not felt that it would scarcely be in good taste todiscuss the subject with Miss Stuart almost within earshot In themeantime it did not distress him in the least to defer the telling ofthe story for Jean of course knew nothing whatever of the matterand it was extremely improbable that Miss Stuart would ever take thepains to enlighten her In justice to Farr it should be said that hehad completely forgotten the incident of the shrubbery which had meantso much to Jean and he was not aware of the words that she hadoverheard and of the construction that she had not unnaturally putupon themAnd all this while poor little Jean lay on the sofa in her darkenedroom sobbing as if her heart would break She had waited so patientlyon Tuesday hoping against hope that he would come and explaineverything to her For of course there was something to explainelse why had he so distinctly avoided all mention of Miss Stuart evenwhen she had asked him if he knew herHe has a right to his past she said to herself with quiveringlips but oh if they were such old friends if she calls him Valif he remembers one evening with her even to the color of her gown hemightoh he might have remembered to speak of her to meThe more she thought it over the greater seemed the proofs of hisdeception If he and Miss Stuart had been old friends and nothingmore it would have been his natural impulse to speak of his surpriseand pleasure at meeting her at the manor He had failed to do so andwith despair in her heart Jean told herself that he must have hadsome strong reason for his silenceTuesday wore away and still no word had come from him She determinednot to let Miss Stuart see how unhappy she was so kept about with theothers and entered into all their plans with forced gayety Whenhalfpast nine struck on Wednesday evening she gave up all hope ofseeing him for they were very informal in Hetherford and kept earlyhours She went up to her room and as she slipped on her wrapper shefell to crying and when Susie knocked and announced Farr she was toodisfigured by her tears to think of going down The disappointment wasvery keenPlease excuse me Susie she called through the closed door I amsorry but I am lying downAs she heard the maids retreating step she would fain have recalledher and sent some other message but it was too lateThe next day on the decks of the Sylph Farr and Jean met for thefirst time since Monday Jean came aboard fully resolved to tender anapology for having excused herself on the previous evening She hadnever lacked selfconfidence before but today she could scarcelypluck up courage to speak to him Timidly she made her first friendlyovertures only to be met with an unmistakable rebuff Farr answeredthe questions she put to him but with a studied indifference whichmade her cheeks tingle to make matters worse he presently saunteredoff from the group of which Jean made one and joined Miss Stuartwho was seated a short distance away Jeans face grew hard as shestifled the sob which rose in her throat and she registered a vowthat never again would she give him an opportunity to treat her soslightingly It was unmanly and unmannerly and she had done with himforever She did not flinch from the path she laid out for herselfand so successfully did she play the part that Dick and Molliewalking home in the cool of the evening declared that it was like thegood old days to have Jean so jolly and full of funMiss Stuart meanwhile was content to keep Farr at her side despitethe fact that he was a most morose and taciturn companion She knewwherein lay her advantage and although the knowledge was notflattering to her selfpride it did not prevent her from making thebest of her opportunities It was galling to her that Jean had thepower to make him so miserable but the trouble between them servedher purpose very well for the present As she talked to himpleasantly she did not seem to notice that his replies weremonosyllabic and that he watched Jeans every movement with gloomyeyes She was a clever woman with a rare gift of conversation andere long her tactful efforts were rewarded and Farr roused from hisabstraction shook himself out of his illhumor In the course of theday he made one or two attempts at a reconciliation with Jean but asboth she and Miss Stuart had concentrated their energies to preventhis accomplishing his purpose he failed signallyAs day followed day the breach between Jean and her lover was nothealed and no hand was stretched forth to stay its everwideninglimits                                   LillianMiss Stuart laid down her book and looked expectantly up at HelenI have a suggestion to make for this afternoon How would you like todrive over to Crescent Beach to call on Mrs MaynardI agree to the drive replied Miss Stuart stifling a yawn but whymust we call on that stupid woman She always bores me to deathThere was a ring of annoyance in Helens voice as she answeredOh it is not at all necessary for you to go with me One of mysisters would be delighted to do soSo much the better my dear said Miss Stuart indifferently as shepicked up her book and resumed her readingWhy are you so down on little Mrs Maynard queried WendellChurchill emerging from a recess of the window where he and Nathaliehad been whiling away the morning hours with mandolin and banjoI am not down on her in the least but I think she is uninterestingto a degreeShe paused until the portires had closed on Helens retreatingfigure and then met Churchills eyes with a meaning smileIt is not surprising is it that her husband should find MrsDesborough a pleasing contrastIn her faraway corner hottempered Nathalie caught the words andflared up in defense of her friendOh I think it is a shame to speak so Mrs Maynard is unhappy butno woman ever bore unhappiness with greater dignity It seems to meincredible that everybodys sympathies are not enlisted on her sideI am very unfortunate returned Miss Stuart with thinly veiledsarcasm This is the second time I have erred in this way I must bemore careful in future not to give expression to my opinionsChurchill saw that some unpleasantness was imminent and manlikerushed in only to make matters worseDont you think Miss Nathalie looks very much like Mrs Desborough Ihave so often noticed the resemblanceWith blazing eyes Nathalie started up from the low windowseatFrom all I know of her I cannot feel flattered by the complimentand with this parting shot she thrust open the French windows andflew out on the verandaDear dear murmured Miss Stuart in mock dismay what a tempest ina teapot Those girls are terribly spoiled and it is all Helensfault She is unpardonably weak with themChurchill was very much embarrassed by the position in which he foundhimself He extricated himself by muttering something barelyintelligible to the effect that the Lawrences were so much attachedto each other and then retreated hastily to find Nathalie andreinstate himself in her good gracesWhen afternoon came Miss Stuart relented and she and Helen withlittle Gladys between them started off in the buckboard for CrescentBeach It was a beautiful drive For a short distance the road woundthrough fragrant meadows and wooded lanes until it came out upon thebeach where for several miles it led straight away over the hardenedsands They bowled swiftly along the fresh salt wind blowing in theirfaces the soothing sound of the ebb and flow of the restless watersbreaking softly on their earsMiss Stuart exhilarated by the clear air the brilliant sunshine andthe congenial companionship of this friend whom she really loved hadnever appeared to a greater advantage It was the Lillian Stuart whomight have been whose cleverness and glancing wit held Helens mindenthralled as they talked of all the subjects dear to womens heartsAll too soon they reached their destination As they drew up under theportecochre of the hotel Helen found herself wishing with all herheart that Lillian might continue in so charming a moodPresently Mrs Maynard joined them in the vast hotel parlor and asMiss Stuart went forward to greet her with great cordiality Helen hadno fault to find with her manner They chatted together for some fewmoments when Miss Stuart recognized some friends of hers in a party ofpeople who had wandered in from the piazza She excused herself andas she joined them Mrs Maynard turned to HelenDont you want to come up to my room for a few moments Helen I amsure that Dorothy would be very glad to see GladysThe child jumped instantly down from her chair her chubby facebeaming with eager anticipationGladys has accepted for me said Helen with an amused smile and thetwo made their way upstairsWhat a lovely view you have exclaimed Helen as she dropped into achair near the open windowIt is pretty Mrs Maynard assented pushing open a door which ledinto the next roomA beautiful little child sat in the middle of the floor hugging a bigwoolly lamb close to her heartDorothy will you please come here and speak to little GladysLawrence who has come to see youAt her mothers bidding Dorothy struggled to her feet and clutchingthe lamb tightly in both hands ran toward the open door Then shecaught sight of Helen and the big violet eyes were swiftly veiledand the little head with its tangled mass of golden curls was hiddenin the folds of her mothers skirt Mrs Maynard smiled in gentlereproof as she lifted the childs faceWhat a baby darling Please be a good little girl and sayhowdoyoudo to GladysDorothy still hung back clinging fast to her mothers hand butGladys who was the most friendly little creature in the world soonsucceeded in overcoming her shyness Presently they were chatteringtogether as happily as possible and Dorothy went so far as to produceher box of paper dolls and to dress them for Gladys benefitMrs Maynards face lighted up with sympathetic interest as Helengave her a graphic account of the weeks gayeties She had known MissStuart for several years and could well understand Helens desire tomake her visit enjoyable Miss Stuart bored might be a verydifficult companionI am so glad for you Helen dear that you have had such pleasanttimes I wish you would let me feel that I had contributed in a smallway toward helping you to entertain Miss Stuart and if you wouldenjoy it I would love to have you all come over here for the dance onSaturday evening I believe they are to have very good music and wewill arrange to have a pleasant little supper together My husbandwill be here and I expect Mr and Mrs Endicott whom you mayrememberYes indeed I do and I know that I can accept for all of us Itwill be moonlight so the drive over will be delightfulOn the way home little else was talked of between the girls but theprospective dance Miss Stuart expressed herself as very much pleasedwith the idea and the plan having received the sanction of herapproval Helen forthwith determined that every arrangement should beas perfect as her careful forethought could make itWhen they reached the manor the girls were having tea on the upperporch They joined them at once and the question of the dance waslaid before themGlorious exclaimed Nathalie ecstatically and her verdict wasloudly echoed by the othersHelen drew a chair up close to the teatable over which Jean waspresiding and pulling off her gloves smoothed them out on her kneewith the palm of her handI want to consult you in regard to the drive Jeanie she said in alowered toneJean nodded and leaned across her to hand a cup of tea to MissStuartNathalie said Helen please give Lillian some of that hot toastToast and jam exclaimed Nan in accents of scorn as she helpedherself generously to both What sordid considerations when there isa bona fide ball in viewLeave a slice for me Nancy laughed Eleanor I must fortify myselfif you are going to wax eloquentStop your nonsense girls and Nathalie waved an imperious hand atthem The question is how shall we drive overJean turned to HelenIf it is a fine night we might go in the wagonetteWhy Jean it would not begin to hold us all interposed EmilyThere are fourteen of us counting the men from the VortexI did not include them Jean replied quietlyMiss Stuart stared curiously at her over the edge of her teacupIt seems to me that a dance without men is rather a tame affair andI dont imagine the hotel will yield a very plentiful supplyJean lifted her chin defiantlyI was not speaking of the dance but of the drive overWell that is perfectly absurd Emily broke in The idea of ourgoing over in one conveyance and those poor men in another What areyou thinking of JeanMiss Stuart laughed softly while Jean vouchsafed never a wordA glance of intelligence was flashed from Nan to Eleanor and Nanspoke up in goodnatured railleryEm dear have you ever heard that enough is as good as a feastJean probably remembered that it it is fully twelve miles there andback and felt some qualms for fear her conversational ability woulddesert herThe laugh was general for it was a joke of long standing that Jeancould talk to anyone at any time and under any circumstanceshowever tryingHelen looked from one to the other with puzzled eyes She had anuncomfortable consciousness that there was something in the air whichshe did not understand She put an end to the discussion with quietdecisionThere will be quite time enough to talk this over later We must waitand see how the weather turns out Now suppose we go downstairs andhave some music before we break upLater that evening she opened the subject again to Miss StuartI will tell you what I have decided Lillian We will hire theHetherford stage and all go over in thatAnd Miss Stuart answered with a tinge of triumph in her voiceThat is certainly a most sensible plan my dearSo it was settled Jean accepted the decision without a protest Deepin her heart she still cherished a strong hope that themisunderstandings between Farr and herself might one day be clearedaway She had acted contrary to her own wishes in excluding him fromthe drive to Crescent Beach and she admitted to herselfshamefacedly that she was glad the matter had been taken out of herhandsCHAPTER XIVA DANCE AT CRESCENT BEACHA very merry party of people assembled at the manor on Saturdayevening Nathalie flitted about among them with dancing feet andshining eyes and one and all caught the spirit of her contagiousenthusiasmOh what a lark it is she cried It is full moon tonight andeverything has gone right from beginning to endThe end is not yet Miss Nathalie Farr said to her with a faintsmileShe shrugged her shoulders and laughed lightheartedlyDont be cynical It is a bad habitThe moon is rising interposed Jean turning about from the opendoorway It is too lovely to stay indoorsA hush fell upon them as they followed her out upon the verandaSentences left unfinished gay laughter checked on the lips paidtribute to the impressive beauty of the scene Far away in the eastthe moon with slow and stately grace lifted its splendor above thedark line of the horizon Against its flaming glory were sharplydefined the somber trunks of sturdy oaks and spreading elms Seenbetween their leafy branches lay the Sound obscured a moment sinceby an impenetrable veil of darkness but reflecting now on itsrippling surface the golden light of the rising orb The night airpulsed with the cheery chirp of the cricket the monotonous chant ofthe katydid Softly the south wind blew rustling among the trees andshrubsNathalie was the first to speak Her quick ear had caught the sound ofwheelsHere comes the stage at last Do let us get off right awayIs everyone here queried Mrs Andrews looking around on the bevyof pretty girls with a smile of complacent satisfactionEveryone but Lillian Helen answered We may as well begin to takeour places She will be down in a few momentsAlready the stage had backed up before the door and Jean was amongthe first to run lightly down the broad flight of steps Farr stood atthe foot and as he held out his hand to assist her she saw that hewas regarding her sadly There was no time for words the others wereflocking down the steps behind them She turned her eyes to meet hiswith a plaintive almost appealing smile She thought they must havespoken for her for ere he released her hand he gave it a quickpressureIt was some few moments before Miss Stuart made her appearance Shedescended the steps slowly with no suggestion of haste Farr heldopen the door for her to enterCome up here by me Lillian Helen called to her from the other endof the stage but she did not seem to hear the request and slippedinto a seat near the doorFarr sprang lightly in but as he would have passed her she laid adetaining hand on his armThere is plenty of room here she said indicating the place besideher and he had no alternative but to take itThe other men crowded past them and as the stage lurched forwardCliff Archer dropped into a seat between Jean and EleanorA great deal of strength is wasted in undue haste he observedlazily I find that laggards invariably prosperWhat heresy Cliff laughed Eleanor softly with an expressiveglance in Miss Stuarts directionCliff appealed to JeanCan you imagine anything more barefaced than that attempt to extort acompliment From a sheer sense of duty I feel compelled to disappointherHe stopped abruptly struck by the expression of Jeans face She hadevidently not heard his words for she was staring straight before herwith strained unseeing eyes Her mouth was compressed with a look ofsuffering in the lines Cliff was very fond of Jean He knew herbetter than the other girls for she and Eleanor were such fastfriends He did not stop to ponder on the cause of her unhappinessbut hastily resolved to shield her if possible Eleanor leaned forwardto speak to her across him but he brought his slender figure betweenthemYou can talk to Jean all day and every day It is my turn tonightmy dear and I intend to monopolize you to my hearts contentWhen Cliff spoke in that tone Eleanor knew there was no appeal to bemade so she yielded the point at once with very good graceAs the stage jolted lumberingly on its way Jean saw nothing of thebeauty of the night heard nothing of the merry laughter the gaysnatches of song which reverberated around her It was perhaps atrifling circumstance that Farr had seated himself quite at the otherend of the stage and at Miss Stuarts side but to Jean in herunhappy state of mind it meant a great deal To her the interchangeof glances a few moments since had been tantamount to a truce betweenthem She had been so sure that Farr would make an effort to secure aplace beside her that she had purposely crowded up in the cornerleaving a space for him between Eleanor and herself Her humiliationwas poignant complete The wound to vanity was beneficial in itseffect rousing all her selfrespect and determining her to hide thetruth from Farr at all hazardsI must be brave she said to herself resolutely I must let him seethat I am happy and lighthearted and she closed her lips firmly tostill their quivering She was quite mistress of herself by the timethe hotel was reachedThe Maynards with their friends the Endicotts awaited them on thebrilliantly lighted veranda and as they descended from the stage withmerry jest and laughter Maynard left his wifes side and ran down thesteps to welcome them He was a goodlooking man with a particularlycharming and cordial manner He had never given much thought to theHetherford girls in his mind he stigmatized them as provincial anduninteresting but tonight as Jean standing in the full glare ofthe hotel office unwound the scarf from around her neck and flungback her wrap an exclamation of surprise rose to his lipsJean was indeed looking very lovely There were faint shadows underthe deep blue eyes the sweet mouth drooped slightly lending newbeauty and depth of expression to her face Maynard hastened to offerher his arm and they moved slowly down the long hall to the entranceof the ballroom The music had just begun when Farrs voice fell onJeans ears At his first words she turned a startled face toward himMiss Lawrence I believe this is our dance Sorry to deprive youMaynard and before Jean could recover from her astonishment Maynardhad bowed himself away and Farr was smiling gravely down at herPlease dont be angry Miss Jean Nothing venture nothing have youknow and I have had so little latelyJean looked up at him helplessly at a loss for an answerI want the waltz very much he added in a tone of pleadingShe laughed a bit unsteadilyWhy of course I will dance with you although I must confess yourmode of asking me is very strangeAll is fair in Which is it Jean he asked softly as they fellinto the measure of the waltzShe dropped her eyes glad that at present no reply was required ofher When the last strain had died away Farr drew her hand throughhis arm and they threaded their way among the crowd out into the coolhallwayIs this your wrap he queried selecting one from the number thatwere thrown across a chair Now let us go outside for a littlestrollThey made their way out on to the little veranda which on this sideof the hotel was built on a ledge of rocks and overhung the waters ofCrescent Bay Avoiding the rank and file of dancers who were nowpromenading slowly up and down they crossed to the railing and stoodthere gazing silently before them In the harbor below myriads ofboats lay at anchor all gayly decorated in honor of the occasionFurther out the moons bright radiance fell softly on the tremulouswaves and across its golden sheen a whitewinged yacht sped silentlyon its wayBy and by Jean roused herself with a slight effortWhat Philistinism it is to illuminate the veranda with those uglylanterns Their flaring light quite spoils the effect of themoonlightHer poor little commonplace attempt to open the conversation met withdisastrous failure Farr muttered inattentively Yes indeed andrelapsed into silence againIn the long pause that ensued the monotonous splash of the wavesagainst the rocks below sounded deliciously cool and refreshing Arowboat shot out from the pier skimming the darkened waters underthe lea of the shoreFarr drew nearer to Jean and spoke with deep earnestnessWe cannot take up the thread of the past Miss Jean with thisconstraint between us but I am not willing to let it go without anattempt at an explanation Will you not tell me what I have done tohave forfeited your friendshipJeans head was bent her few words of dissent almost inaudible Farrinterrupted her in a voice that was both pained and sternPlease dont deny it I cannot have forfeited the right to yourhonesty Did I presume too much on your great kindness to me JeanNo oh no she cried hastily with a little break in her voiceIndeed you must not think thatA mans step approached them and stopped at Jeans sideMiss Lawrence Maynards voice said the next waltz is ours ShallI find you hereWhy certainly she replied with a forced laugh I shall notvanishI wanted to assure myself of the pleasure One is easily lost amongall these people he answered lightly as he turned awayFarrs face darkenedWhat right has Maynard to monopolize you he demanded savagely Heis a married man and not a manIt was an unwise speech and he broke off abruptly convicted of hisfolly by the expression in Jeans unflinching eyesYou forget that Mr Maynard is our host Mr Farr she said coldlyAfter a moment she added more gentlyI did not want you to say anything that you would regret I should besorry to hear you speak ill of a friend It is not like youThe simple words touched Farr and made him feel ashamed of himselfI beg your pardon he said contritely I was a brute to speak soThe truth is I am not myself and have not been during the whole ofthis miserable week I seem never to have the chance to speak withyou and I have tortured myself with the thought that it has been yourdeliberate purpose to avoid meThe opening bars of the waltz and Maynards approach cut short hiswords Slowly the trio forced their way through the moving crowd untilthey had gained the entrance to the ballroom Farr stood listlesslyin the doorway as Maynard whirled Jean away from him across thepolished floor Some minutes later someone touched his elbow and heturned with a start to meet Miss Stuarts eyesVal let us dance together for auld lang syneWith pleasure he assented abstractedly for as she spoke he hadcaught a glimpse of Jean disappearing through one of the long windowswhich gave on the veranda Miss Stuarts glance followed his and hereyes flashed The carelessness of his reply hurt her cruellyI will make Jean suffer for this she vowed as with throbbingheart she took her place among the dancersLater as they passed through the doorway they encountered Jean andMaynard reentering the room Miss Stuart first caught sight of themShe raised her glorious eyes to her companions face and spoke in avoice carefully pitched to reach Jeans earsYes indeed Val it is pleasant to dance together again It bringsback those bygone happy days so forciblyThey were abreast of the other couple now and Farr halted MissStuarts speech had quite escaped him absorbed as he was in watchingJean so he was entirely unprepared for her reception of him As hespoke her name she flashed a light impenetrable smile at him and thendeliberately turned away and he heard her say gayly to the man at hersideMr Maynard that waltz is divine Dont let us miss another bar ofitAnd Maynard answered softlyYour wish is my law Miss JeanThen the crowd surged between them and with a somewhat unreasonablebitterness in his heart Farr blindly followed Miss Stuart to asecluded corner of the veranda Jeans treatment of him wasinexplicable It seemed so much easier for things to go wrong thanright that he felt it was wellnigh useless to struggle against theinevitable Disappointed and dispirited he paid but small heed to hisbeautiful companion who was exerting her rare tact and diplomacy toplease and divert himIn the ensuing hour Jean all unsuspecting of the truth was amplyavenged Never before had it come home to Lillian Stuart with suchconvincing force that against Farrs love for this young girl she wasutterly powerless In vain love taught her a new unselfishness awomanly gentleness quite strange to her in vain did she crush downthe rising storm of jealousy within her breast Farr saw none of thesethings cared for her not at all He sought her society because shemade so few demands upon him and accepted his varying moodsunquestioningly If he thought on the subject at all he explained herkindness to him by the fact that he was possibly more in touch withher world than anyone else in Hetherford The subtle charm of herpersonality which she had ever found so potent was quite lost on thisman whose love she had once possessed and had valued so lightly Hopewas dead in her heart but one weapon of revengeJeans evidentjealousylay within her grasp and this she wielded with unerringskillThe music ceased and soon the veranda was invaded by a host offlushed and heated dancers and among their number Jean with Maynardstill at her side There was a new elasticity in her step a new lightin her eyes and she was flirting quite openly and markedly with hercompanion As the stream bore them past Farr and Miss Stuart she didnot apparently observe them withdrawn as they were into the cornerand falling out of the line of people selected seats at a shortdistance from themMaynard to whom a pretty woman was always irresistible was carriedaway by the girls insouciance and fascination He was the moredelighted because so completely taken by surprise He had picturedJean always as a little puritan who would look upon a flirtation asthe height of immorality but tonight the little puritan had suddenlyblossomed out in a totally unexpected and charming character He wasnot a little flattered by her evident willingness to linger on in thisquiet spot with him when the crowd had once more sought the ballroomand into his manner he infused an added warmth of interestPoor Jean however was invulnerable She had never liked Mr Maynardalthough she had been forced to admit that he was charming andagreeable as an acquaintance The Hetherford girls were one and alltoo sincerely fond of Mrs Maynard to have much patience with the manwho could flagrantly neglect so sweet and lovely a wife It had beenan unwritten code of honor among them to treat him with politeindifference and to promptly snub any attempt on his part to breakdown the barrier of reserve behind which they had entrenchedthemselves Under ordinary circumstances Jean would have despisedherself for the course she was now pursuing but tonight the poorchild was too utterly miserably to care what she did or what becameof her She laughed and flirted recklessly with this man of whom shestrongly disapproved to quell the ache at her heart and when theremedy failed she but laughed and flirted the more It was selfishunworthy but Jean was unversed in suffering and seized upon themeans within reach to enable her to cover up her pain and jealousySomething of the same impulse that influenced Farr with Miss Stuartprompted her to keep this man at her side Those old friends knew hertoo well had seen too much of her with Farr not to have theirsuspicions aroused by her feverish and exaggerated gayetyAt last the evening was over and they stood in the hotel officeawaiting the arrival of the stage Jean was somewhat apart from theothers with Maynard bending over her and talking to her in loweredtonesHer little foot tapped the floor nervously her cheeks burned hotlyand one unsteady little hand waved a big fan to and fro Her couragewas rapidly forsaking her and she rallied all her strength in onelast effort to appear naturally gay and at ease She felt she must notbreak down now with Farr only a few paces away for although shenever raised her eyes yet she knew he was watching herAs pretty little Mrs Maynard moved about among her guests speakingto them in her softly modulated voice she bent a glance of anxiousintentness upon Jean She was far too inured to her husbandsindifference to be deeply hurt by this new flirtation carried onbefore her very eyes but this new phase in Jeans character puzzledher But her own sad experience had quickened her intuition of othersunhappiness and so it was that in her gentle heart there was more ofcommiseration than angerHer thoughts were interrupted by Dicks announcement that the stagewas at the door When Jean came to bid her goodnight she looked intothe strained pathetic eyes with compassionate tenderness and asudden impulse made her lean forward and kiss the girl lovinglyOnce more the old stage rumbled over the road between Hetherford andCrescent Beach The wind had veered a point to the east and blew dampand chill driving before it a mist of clouds across the skyobscuring the moons bright light The sudden change in the atmospherewas felt by everybody and the conversation was spasmodic broken bylong intervals of silence Jean very white and still now that thetension was relaxed shrank back into her corner clinging fast toEleanors hand In a further corner Farr sat at Helens side silentduring the whole of the long driveCHAPTER XVHELEN IS PUZZLEDMiss Stuarts visit was drawing to a close and Nan was giving aluncheon in her honor The little parlor of the parsonage was redolentwith the fragrance of roses and mignonette which were massed in everyvase and bowl and the arrangement of the simple oldfashionedfurniture bore evidence of Nans artistic taste A few good etchingsand a halfdozen rare old prints adorned the walls and scatteredabout on the low mantel were several valuable bits of vertuNan stood in the center of the room and received her guests withoutstretched hand and beaming faceNow I call this delightful she said cheerily as she shook handswith Miss Stuart Even father has gone away for the day so we are atypical Hetherford partyall girls and no men Em said you would bebored to death she rattled on in a confidential undertone but foronce in a way I thought you might find it amusing to have plenty ofyour own sex It is no novelty to us as Em will tell you with a faceas long as the moral codeI think it is charming Miss Stuart affirmed with a greater regardfor amiability than for truthNan smiled mischievouslyConfess it is dullIndeed it is not Miss Nan The imp of dullness would never dare toshow his surly face in your presenceAh you do not know and Nan shook her head in laughing protestDrop in here any Sunday between churchtime and dinner and you willfind us boon companionsThe door into the diningroom was opened and a grimvisaged woman ina starched calico gown of uncompromising stiffness appeared on thethreshold For a moment she eyed Nan threateningly and thenannouncedYour lunch is on the table and added as she faced about andmarched back into the dining room and its getting coldNan in no wise disconcerted turned a wry face toward her guestsBiddy and I had one of our most deadly affrays just before youarrived so dont be surprised at anything she may give us forluncheon I tried for your sakes to keep my temper until later inthe day but it wouldnt be keptIt never will sighed Emily ruefully in the midst of the generallaughNan ushered them into the dining roomMiss Stuart will you sit here on my right Girls take any placesyou wantYou neednt have worried about luncheon Nan These biscuits aresimply delicious observed Helen consolingly as Bridget vanishedinto the kitchen Biddy is far too proud of her skill to disgraceyouOh she would not mind me laughed Nan airily Nothing wouldrestrain her but her sense of importance and her undying jealousy ofyour cookWhat a glorious time we had at the dance Emily remarkedirrelevantly It was about the most successful thing we have donethis summer It has made such a difference having the Vortex herehasnt it JeanJean thus addressed changed color rapidly and then was furious withherself for she caught Miss Stuarts eyes fixed on her with insolentdirectnessOh bother the Vortex cried Mollie petulantly Dont let us talkabout men There are dozens of subjects more interestingWe will make it man and talk of Dick Eh Mollie and Nathalielaughed provokinglyWe couldnt do better responded Mollie imperturbably Dick islovely is he not Miss StuartMiss Stuart flung back her head with a merry laugh no whitembarrassed by the nave question Dick had been her shadow for thepast week and was sighing and pining like the most approved oflovers yet she answered with a nonchalance which Nathalie would havegiven worlds to acquireHe is truly charming Miss Mollie I quite share your enthusiasmThen she dropped out of the conversation listening with languidinterest to the topics which the others fell to discussing with muchanimation Their views of life differed materially from her own theircomplete unworldliness called a halfcontemptuous smile to her lipsand yet there was awakened within her a shadowy feeling of regret Shehad lived a purely pleasureloving life without a thought beyond herown advancement along the line of her ambitions To a certain extentshe had been eminently successful Her marvelous beauty supplementedby a decided mental ability had strewn her path with the admirationand adulation which she craved and faults and failings which in aless beautiful woman would have received harsh censure were in hercase overlooked and condoned Today for the first time the thoughtassailed her that perhaps she was the victim of an erroneous ideathat perhaps these young girls living their lives so simply actuatedby a desire to act uprightly and to be honest and affectionate inevery relationship in life had found a happiness which had eluded hergraspNathalie who vainly strove at times to be cynical made some carelessremark and Miss Stuart listened wonderingly to a gentle remonstrancewhich Eleanor administered in accents of earnestnessAh Nat dear dont say that even in fun Everything makes adifferenceIndeed yes added Helen     No stream from its source flows seaward       How lonely soever its course     But what some land is gladdened       No star ever rose or set     Without influence somewhereShe quoted the lines charmingly despite the little shyness which wasso characteristic of herI suppose that is true said Mollie thoughtfully and in the largethings in life we know that we can only be in harmony with Gods planby acting absolutely in accordance with our consciences But it ishard to realize the importance of our decision in regard to the smalldaily occurrences They seem almost too insignificant to exert anyinfluence either for good or evilInfluence does not lie only in deeds Mollie Eleanor repliedeither small or great It seems to me that it is what we are notwhat we do that is the essential thing If ones heart is pure andtrue purity and truth will be manifested in ones actions howevertrivial And remember dear for I am going to quote now     No life can be strong in its purpose and pure in its strife     And all life not be stronger and purer therebyJean gave her friends hand an affectionate squeezeI do believe you are the best girl living she whispered softlywith an air of profound convictionYou see girls what it is to have a friend like JeanYou mean like Eleanor Jean promptly retortedI suppose that is true friendship mused MollieMust friendship necessarily be as blind as love queried Nan with asmile at the two girls which robbed the words of any stingJean knows nothing of love declared Emily with an air ofsuperiority which was eminently amusing It was common parlance thatEmily never saw the general aspect of things quite as clearly as mostpeopleJean joined somewhat constrainedly in the laugh that greeted thesewords and wondered if it could be her imagination that Miss Stuartssmile held a covert sneerIt was late in the afternoon when Helen reached the manor and made herway up to the nursery The room was dim for heavy clouds shortenedthe summer day A sharp east wind moaned through the trees outsideand nurse had wisely lighted a wood fire in the wide chimneyplace Itsfitful flickering light fell full on little Gladys kneeling before thehearth her eyes big with excitement as her chubby hands shaped awonderful house of blocks while near her Larry lying flat on hisback threw out occasional hints and suggestions as to itsconstruction Willie curled up in one of the deep windowseats wasmaking the best of the fastfading daylight to finish a story whichto judge from his absorbed expression must have been of thrillinginterest As Helen pushed open the door and advanced toward thecheerful fire three pairs of eyes looked up to greet herWell chicks you all look very happy and comfieGladys thrust out her hands in quick alarm to save her block housefrom dangerous contact with the skirt of Helens gownPease take care sister she lisped Dont step on our bockscause Larry an me is buildin a big castleBaby baby Larry an me is buildinGladys shook her fluffy head impatientlyI havent got any time to bovver Im velly busyHelen laughed and dropping down upon the floor began to lend ahelping hand Gladys sank back on her heels with a complacent sighBuild a booful one sister big as this raising her arms high overher headHelen nodded but paused from her task block in hand to give aglance at WilliePut down your book dearie she said to him This is the worstpossible light to read in You will ruin your eyesWillie heaved a sigh as he closed the precious book and stretchinghimself after his cramped position rose slowly to his feet andjoined the group before the fire Flinging himself down near Helen helaid his head in her lap She patted his little round faceaffectionately and went on with her castlebuildingThe setting sun had broken through the clouds and a flood of yellowlight streamed through the western windows From the huge logs in thefireplace an increasing volume of flames roared up the chimney itsruddy glow illuminating the eager faces of the children intent onevery movement of their sisters deft hands The truly wonderful houseof blocks was nearing completion when Jean came quietly into the roomFor a moment she stood silent in the shadowy doorway contemplating thepretty scene with wistful eyes As she approached more nearly sheunconsciously echoed Helens words of a few moments pastWell you look very happy all of youHelen laughed softlyThis is an exciting moment Jeanie so you must not marvel if we arenot very talkativeJean leaned against one side of the oldfashioned chimneyplace andabsently watched the placing of the last few blocksGladys she whispered after a moment what do you think I saw justnowWhat Jeanie lifting her flushed face to her sistersMary on her way upstairs with your supper and oh what cookiesGoody cried Larry springing to his feet with a bound which broughtthe beautiful castle tumbling to the groundYou naughty boy scolded Gladys crossly See what you doneJean took the angry pouting little face between her hands and smiledtenderly down into the tearful eyesIt is hard luck baby but you might as well get used to having yourcastles demolishedIts a shame grumbled Willie who was almost as disappointed as hislittle sister Larrys always roughNever mind dear interrupted Helen rising from the floor I amsure Larry didnt mean to upset the house and in any case we couldnot leave it in Marys wayBother MaryHush Willie you must not speak so Now run away and dress fordinner Larry and Gladys must have their supperJean followed her sister out into the hall and laid a detaining handon her armHelen she said very low are you ever really unhappyWhy yes Jean sometimes But why do you ask Surely you are alwaysin good spiritsJean smiled a little bitterlyOh of course I am and I suppose I must go on fulfilling my destinyuntil the end of the chapter But even if one has a reputation forunending hilarity there are times She broke off abruptly with alaugh which suggested tears and rushed away in the direction of herroom leaving Helen sorely puzzledCHAPTER XVIIT WAS ONLY MY IMAGINATIONMay I come in Aunt HelenCertainly dear Aunt Helen looked up from the open Bible on herknee and welcomed Jean with a cheery smile Where were you allyesterday I did not have a glimpse of youThe girl crossed the room and dropping down into an easychair nearthe open window gazed listlessly out across the sunlit lawnOh I was just here as usualAunt Helen closed her Bible and laid it carefully down on the tableAre you tired already of so much pleasuring JeanieI dont see that we have had a great deal of pleasuring lately herniece replied perversely I think Hetherford is the stupidest placein the world and I am tired of everythingAunt Helen was far too wise to remonstrate just then After a momentssilence she opened a subject which had never failed to awaken aninterest in JeanI had a nice letter from Mrs Appleton today They seem to bethoroughly enjoying themselves now and she says Guy is workingsplendidly and expects to accomplish great things on his returnYes was Jeans inattentive response as her eyes marked thecircling of a buzzing fly outside the windowMiss Stuart is making quite a long visit ventured Aunt Helenpatiently I had thought that she would soon tire of HetherfordI am sure I dont see why she doesnt go away The whole house isturned upside down to provide her with amusement It is a perfectboreMy dear Aunt Helen objected that is surely not the spirit of truehospitality We do not speak ill of our guests Noblesse obligeI cant help it and Jean now thoroughly aroused started up fromher chair I am not going to pretend to like a person when I dontShe is insufferably patronizing and I hate herAunt Helen looked up at her niece with real distress in her eyesWhy child and she held out her hand come here I want to speakto youJean stood irresolute looking half ashamed and wholly miserable Atthat most inopportune moment Nathalie flung open the doorOh here you are Jean I have been looking all over for you Come ondown and have a game of tennis before dinner Why whats the matterJean hastily averted her faceNothing I dont care to play tennisOh please do I am just in the humor for itYou may be but I am not Jean returned curtlyWhat in the world has come over you asked Nathalie bluntly Inever knew anyones disposition to become as uncertain and irritableas yours has latelyWhy dont you let me alone then My temper may be growing bad butyours has never been anything elseNathalie shrugged her shoulders and laughing shortly went on her waywithout another wordWhen the door had closed on her Jean slipped down on the floor andburying her face in Aunt Helens lap sobbed convulsivelyI dont know what is the matter with me she faltered I am socross and irritable lately Everything seems to set my nerves on edgeI never used to feel soAunt Helen passed her thin hand soothingly over the girls bent headDont worry about it dearie Of course you did not mean to speak soYou are tired and unstrung todayBy and by Jeans sobs grew less frequent then ceased altogether Shelifted her head and resting her arm on Aunt Helens knee droppedher chin in her hand and stared absently before her All trace ofemotion had left her face and it now wore an expression of utterweariness and dejection Her aunt looked thoughtfully down at her Hadit been either Helen or Nathalie who had thus given way it would nothave troubled her but proud little Jean was too reserved andselfcontained to break down unless she had been very sorely triedThe silence had lasted some few moments when Aunt Helen again spokeIn spite of your denial Jean I fear that your playtime has lastedtoo long Discontent never fails to creep in among us when we areidle You see dear I am taking it for granted that it is nothingdeeper than a feeling of discontent which makes you so unhappy I knowof nothing else unless She paused Jean stirred uneasily underher direct glance Aunt Helen instantly averted her eyes and resumedI am sorry that my ill health forces me to lead my life so apart fromyou all I am in ignorance of the many currents and eddies which wouldotherwise be apparent to me but if ever you need my advice you knowhow gladly I will give it to you and there are times when an old headis better than a young oneStill Jean did not speak Aunt Helen sighed a little sadlyWell my child I suppose I am mistaken and that your trouble isonly a surfeit of pleasureI am a great baby Auntie but I am glad I came here to you to havemy cry out You always help me so and make me ashamed of being soimpatient and Jean looked lovingly up into the worn face which wasbent above herThank you dearie You must come to me whenever you feel discouragedand unhappy and remember I always stand ready to give you whatevercomfort or counsel lies within my power But Jean and her voice wasvery grave I have learned from my own experience both of pettyannoyance and of great trials that there is only one true source ofstrength                                   At a late hour that night Lillian Stuart sat before the lowdressingtable in her cozy room reviewing the events of the pastweek The face which the mirror reflected was clouded the eyes somberand full of fire for the consciousness of defeat was upon her Asyet however no thought of capitulation occurred to her Farrsindifference his evident love for another but deepened her love forhim stinging it into a passion that was wellnigh overmastering herThe difficulties in her path lent new zest to the struggle rousingwithin her heart an insatiable desire for conquest Possession hadever palled upon her She had loved Farr but as an accepted lover hehad wearied her and her love for him was not strong enough to drownthe voice of worldly wisdom and prudence To be sure in those days hewas hardly more than a boy poor and unknown whereas today he was aman well versed in the worlds ways liberally supplied with theworlds goods and with the respect and esteem of his fellowmen yetpreserving the same sweet magnetic personality which long ago hadmade such a deep impression on her somewhat fickle heart Theseconsiderations naturally had weight with her but the secret of herdetermination lay not in these but in the obstacles to be surmountedthe flattering assurance that her power could not be foiled Had shebeen quite honest with herself she must have acknowledged that oncethe victory gained the charm would be forever broken As Farrs wifeshe would be a thoroughly wretched woman Knowing full well his hatredof an untruth his contempt for a deception his passionate anger atan injustice did she not dream what a death to his soul a union withher would have been Alas she herself had revealed to him theshallowness of her nature the pettiness of her ambitions thefaithlessness of her heart The lesson was a bitter one but he hadlearned it well and deep in her soul Lillian Stuart knew that neveragain would he give his love unworthily She hated Jean Lawrence yetshe appreciated her purity and gentleness the fineness of her naturethe almost exalted bent of her mind But this appreciation did notsoften her heart nor weaken her determination Jean had balked herand Jean must sufferThe face in the mirror before her grew hard there were rigid linesabout the mouth the wonderful eyes gleamed strangely brightI love him I have always loved him She shall not have him It isthe one satisfaction that is left me if all else failsSharp upon these thoughts came a tap upon the door and Helen Lawrenceentered A soft wrapper enveloped her slender frame and her hair hungloose upon her shouldersI wanted to come in for a little chat Lillian Do you mind if Ibraid my hair hereWhy no indeed I am glad to have you Sit downHelen drew a chair up close to the dressingtable and seatingherself began slowly to plait her long soft hair She put aside somelight topic which Miss Stuart suggested and spoke at once of thesubject which lay nearest her heartI am worried about Jean Lillian She does not seem like herselflately and if it were not absurd I should begin to think she wasunhappy about somethingIndeed The response was so brief as to be almost an ejaculationHelens words accorded strangely with Miss Stuarts thoughtsYes and you dont know how unusual it is for Jean to be eitherirritable or moody She has a very bright sunny nature and isparticularly sweettemperedPerhaps there is something troubling her which you have notperceivedHelen wrinkled her forehead thoughtfullyI am afraid there must beMiss Stuart darted a swift glance at herHave you ever thought what it might beHelens attention was caught by a certain tone in her friends voiceShe raised her eyes questioninglyNo dear I wish I had a clewSuppose I should give you oneThere was genuine surprise in Helens face She answered with atenderness in her voice which gave her companion a pangWhy Lillian do you know of anything to make Jean unhappyMiss Stuart lifted her head as if to strengthen her purpose wonderingat the sudden weakness in herself which made the words so hard to sayYour sister is in love with Mr FarrOh gasped Helen staring blankly at her friendI only wonder you have not seen it before added Miss StuartcoollyDont you think he is in love with her blundered Helen who had notsufficiently recovered from her astonishment to be very wise in JeansbehalfThe answer was incisiveI do notThe hot tears rushed to Helens eyesOh my poor little JeanMiss Stuart turned away and to save herself spoke harshlyFor Heavens sake Helen dont cry It is such a weak thing to doThe sharp words brought Helen suddenly to a realization of what shehad done in thus accepting without demur Miss Stuarts statement inregard to Jean Too late she remembered that it was little short ofdisloyalty to discuss the subject with an outsider an outsidermoreover who had never made any pretense of liking her sister Sheresolved to retrieve herself if possible and answered not a littleproudlyI am sorry I offended you Lillian We often differ in our opinionsas to what is weak and what is notNot often but always Lillian broke in with a disagreeable laughWhere I was weak continued Helen ignoring utterly theinterruption was in laying too much stress on your verdict inregard to my sister I am not authorized to contradict your statementbut I think it is more than probable that your perceptions have beenat fault In regard to Mr Farr he has certainly seemed to both likeand admire Jean Once or twice I have even thought him very muchconcerned about her Why at the danceI imagine my dear that your perceptions are equally as faulty as myown It may interest you to learn that Mr Farr and I were at one timeengaged that he loved me madly and that my breaking of theengagement was a terrible blow to him It is possible however sincein your opinion Mr Farr has transferred his affections from me toyour sister that he has already confessed this to her The tauntingwords were spoken lightly but Miss Stuarts eyes searched Helensface What she saw there must have satisfied her for she turned asidewith an air of reliefThere was a brief pause which was broken by a question from HelenDoes Mr Farr still care for you LillianThe clear truthful eyes met Miss Stuarts squarely and under theirsteady gaze she moved restively It was not easy to tell a direct lieto Helen She bent her head and a slow flush mounted to her faceThat is hardly fair Helen He certainly has not told me of anychange in his feeling toward me She flung back her head and herlustrous eyes held a challenge You have seen him with me What doyou thinkHer face was alight with power and magnetism the scarlet lips wereslightly parted as the breath came hurriedly through them one firmwhite hand on her breast held together the loose folds of herdressinggown which fell about her superb figure in long gracefullines At that moment she was regal majesticHelen gazed at her steadfastly and her heart sankPoor little Jean she thought hopelessly What could she doFor Helen as was her wont laid too much stress upon her friendsgreat beauty of face and form and overlooked the deeper beauty of hersisters soulAs she crept into bed that night she murmured to herselfI must warn Jean gently and lovingly God grant it may not be toolateHer opportunity came the very next evening for directly dinner wasfinished Nathalie and Miss Stuart started off on a longplanned ridewith Churchill and Andrews Jean stood on the veranda to watch themmount and ride away Her eyes followed them until their four figuresswaying slightly with the motion of the horses were no longersilhouetted against the evening sky then descended the broad flightof steps and wandered out into the garden The sun had already setbut the earth was still wrapped in the mystic light of the purpleafterglow Once in the sweet oldfashioned garden Jean paced slowlyup and down the trim paths bordered by rows of fragrant mignonetteand carnations and flanked at the corners by tall hollyhocks andslender poppies and into her sad heart stole something of the peaceand quiet of the tranquil spotIt is all so strange and incomprehensible ran her thoughts but Iam not going to worry about it There must be some mistake somewhereI believed in him so implicitly I felt so sure of his loveoh Icannot I will not believe that he deliberately deceived me If onlyhe were here now while she is away I am sure that everything couldbe explained Oh he might comehe might be honest with meThe garden gate clicked and she looked up with startled eyes but itwas only Helen coming down the path to meet herWhy did you run away her sister asked as she linked her arm inhersI didnt run very fast smiled Jean I sauntered out when the girlsstarted off for their ride It is so restful here she added in alower toneThat doesnt sound one bit like you Jean said Helen slowly I amafraid something must be troubling you if you feel the need of arestful place where you can be aloneJean laughed nervouslyWhy what an absurd idea Helen Why should I be unhappyThat is just what I dont know dear but I think you areWell what if I am cried Jean brought to bay One cannot alwaysbe perfectly contented and happy I do not suppose that I am to be anymore exempt than other peopleHelens eyes were bent on the ground and she spoke with somehesitationOf course that is true enough but there is usually some definitecause for unhappiness I dont want to be impertinent Jean but isthere not some one thing weighing on you at present Has Shepaused then went on desperatelyhas Mr Farr anything to do withitShe felt the violent start that Jean gave heard the sharp indrawingof her breath and she did not dare to raise her eyes to her sistersface for fear of reading there still further confirmation of hersurmises She had need of all her courage yet to deal the cruel blowand without pausing for breath she hurried on Her words wereconfused incoherent but they struck a chill as of death to Jeanstender heartIt was only a foolish idea of mine Jeanie Of course there is notruth in itthere cant bethere must not be Hethat is I havejust discovered that he is deeply in love with Lillian They have beenengaged and I fear the engagement is about to be renewed Whydarling he is not worthy of a thought of yours Forget him Jeandarling It is only your imagination Her voice choked and she endedabruptlyFor an instant not a sound broke the stillness then Jean faced hersister with strained wideopen eyes and spoke to her in a voice thatwas quite steady but curiously dull and unnaturalI am very glad you have told me of this Helen Now that I think ofit I am not greatly surprised You need not worry about me I am allrightThey had ceased from their walking to and fro and as they stood thusopposite each other Jean swayed a little Helen flung both arms aroundherOh darling what is it Speak to me It is only Helen I love youso dearJean suffered the embrace but there was no responsive yielding in theslender rigid figure When Helen released her she drew away andstarted toward the gate Helen did not stir and when Jean had gone afew steps she paused and turned her white stricken face toward hersisterYou need not worry about me she repeated I am all right Andthen with a pathetic outstretching of her hands she added It wasonly my imaginationHelen sprang forward but Jean waved her back and in another momentthe shadows of the gloaming hid the flitting figure from Helenstearful eyesCHAPTER XVIITHE VORTEX DEPARTSLet fall Give wayTwo oars struck the water with a splash and the dingey shot out fromthe gang steps of the Sylph the steady strokes of two sturdy sailorssending the little craft swiftly on its way The owner lounged lazilyin the cushioned stern one leg swung over the other the tillerropesheld loosely in his hands They were sweeping under the stern of theVortex when a voice from the schooners deck hailed them Thesailors held their oars suspended and Churchill pushed back his capand looked up frowning slightly for the sun was in his eyesHello FarrHello old man Going ashoreYes Want a liftThanks if you dont

to your quartersIve been grinding at the charts Our stay here is about at an endand Dodd is a little dissatisfied with the progress of our workThrough one cause and another we have been delayed and

the lighted end of his cigarNo I shall be sorry to goAfter a slight pause he addedWhat has been going onNothing much Andrews has gone up to town Miss Stuart is still atthe manor but of course that is no news to youI imagined she had not left returned Farr indifferently I amgoing to call there this afternoonSuppose then you meet me here say in a couple of hours suggestedChurchill as he brought the dingey up to the float and go out anddine with me aboard the Sylph I am by myself for Andrews is awayand Archer is engagedThanks I will be delightedChurchill turned to the sailor who stood erect in the boat awaitinghis ordersAt six sharp Petersen and tell the steward there will be two fordinnerThen the two men turned on their heels and strode briskly up the sandyroad Presently their paths diverged and with a friendly nod theyseparatedFarr went along in the direction of the manor at a swinging gait Hehad not seen Jean since the night of the dance In the events of thatevening his love for her had sustained a severe shock He could not atonce readjust himself to this new and unwelcome development in thenature of her to whom he had given his deepest and most loyalallegiance Heretofore he had found his love for her intensified byher coldness and indifference but her flirtation with Maynard was notthe sort of thing he had expected from her and it disappointed himbitterly The world condoned many of Maynards offenses because hepossessed a certain charm and amiability of manner but Farr was toocleanminded and upright to look lightly upon the mans selfishdisregard of every moral obligation and he was impatient of hisilldeserved popularity That Jean should show this man so marked apreference was to him incomprehensible It was possible that she didnot know the full truth in regard to him but even her innocence andunworldliness could not altogether shield her from blame for she didknow that he was a faithless husband and moreover his wife was herfriend Under any other circumstances Farr would have been jealousbut now the sharpness of his disappointment in Jean outweighed everyother consideration She had been to him the embodiment of sweetnessand purity and as he paced up and down the white decks of theVortex he inveighed bitterly against this second overthrow of hisfaith His anger was shortlived however for the tender little Jeanof the early summer had twined herself closely about his heart andnow she rose strong in the power and might of her love denyingvaliantly that other self pleading earnestly for more confidence andtrust So it happened this sunshiny day that as Farr leaned againstthe rail gazing seaward and pondered on these strange andcontradictory events suddenly the bitterness died out of his heartand in its place sprang up a passionate longing to see Jean to hearher sweet voice tell him it was all a mistake to put an end foreverto this intolerable uncertainty And even as he came to thisconclusion the dingey from the Sylph hove in view and withoutpausing to reconsider he hailed itNow he had left the manor gates behind and striking out across thelawn increased his pace for his impatience would not be curbed Thecrunching sound of wheels on the gravel brought him to a standstillOn his right a clump of cedars hid the road from sight He thrustaside the lowgrowing branches and as he peered through the aperturea carriage flashed by Jean was driving and he had a tantalizingglimpse of her bonny face as she turned to speak to Eleanor andCliff who were on the back seat An involuntary exclamation escapedhim and he sprang forward but his voice was unheard his presenceunheeded and with a heavy heart he gazed after the rapidly retreatingvehicle With a savage little laugh he swung about and retraced hissteps The joyousness of the summer day was darkened for him and inhis heart was a fierce resentment against FateHis eyes were bent upon the ground as he plodded slowly along theroad and so he did not see Miss Stuart driving alone in Helensbuckboard until she was within a few yards of himMiss Stuart scanned his face furtively as he stood beside thecarriageAh Val she said with an assumption of ease I suppose you havebeen at the manorNo I met them drivingHow inhospitable of them not to have turned back she exclaimedwith her eyes still on his faceFarr was too obtuse to appreciate the drift of her remarkI was unfortunate They did not see meMiss Stuarts brows contracted in a frown and she flicked the longlash of her whipYou are not flattering Val I was at homeHe looked up at her quickly a vague surprise in his eyesI would not venture to inflict myself on you he replied with acareless laugh and then he stood back a step and raised his hatMiss Stuarts face flushed angrily but she had no alternative but todrive on As she gathered up the reins she shot a glance over hershoulder at Farr but already he had turned away and was movingrapidly down the road She cut the horse with the whip and in herheart was a burning desire to revenge herself on JeanAs they took their places about the dinnertable at the manor thatevening Nathalie made some casual mention of the Vortex thusgiving Miss Stuart the pretext she soughtBy the way she said fixing her eyes on Jeans face although herwords were addressed to Helen on my way home this afternoon after Ileft you I met Mr Farr and had such a pleasant chat with him He wason his way to call on us but as he met me I suppose She brokeoff with a charming air of embarrassmentJean raised her head proudly and met Miss Stuarts gaze withunflinching eyesYou should have brought Mr Farr back to tea she said sounconcernedly that even Helen was deceived and Miss Stuart wasstirred with a passing feeling of admirationBut the effort cost Jean a pang and as she turned her eyes slowlyaway there was a great coldness at her heartThe following afternoon the girls were having tea in the drawingroomthe long French windows were pushed wide open and the soft west windmoved the curtains gently to and fro The blinds were drawn for thesun shone hotly and the halfdarkened room seemed deliciously cooland refreshing after the sultry atmosphere of the outer worldLittle Gladys danced in from the hallway waving a letter in the airI took it away from Susie sister she cried in her clear childishtreble I dont know who its forMiss Stuart leaned forward in her chair and caught the soft dimpledwrist in her firm white handLet me read the address for you babyGladys demurred shaking her fluffy head her blue eyes full oflaughter but Miss Stuart quietly possessed herself of the letterHer face fell as she turned toward the light and read the address Thehandwriting familiar yet half strange awakened a host of memorieswithin her but the written name was not the one she had been wont tosee She read the address aloud with a tinge of sarcasm in her smoothvoiceMiss Jean Lawrence The Manor House For you Miss JeanJean crossed the room and took the envelope from Miss Stuarts handShe could not repress a faint start of surprise as her eyes fell uponthe superscription but the scornful smile on Miss Stuarts lips lenther instant selfcontrol She slipped the letter into her pocket andresuming her place at Eleanors side took up the thread of theconversation where it had been broken off with apparent ease andfacility But her heart was beating wildly and the hand that heldthe dainty teacup was far from steadyIt was almost an hour later when she pushed aside the portires andentered the music room She glanced about her anxiously to assureherself that she was alone then crossing to the further end andensconsing herself in one of the deep windowseats pulled the letterfrom her pocket For an instant she held it in her hand her browsdrawn together a wistful questioning look in her eyes She wasforcing herself to recall every word that Helen had said to her thatmiserable evening in the garden In the light of that talk thisletter to her from Valentine Farr both puzzled and troubled her Shelooked down at the address and with a sudden light of determinationin her face broke the seal     MY DEAR MISS JEAN     We have received our orders and leave Hetherford on     Thursday Will you not let me see you before we sail I     started for the manor yesterday but from a distance saw you     driving away I seem to be most unfortunate but I cannot     turn my back on the place where I have found so much     happiness without an attempt to see you again to assure     myself at least that I carry with me your friendship and     good will You were very good to me in the early days of our     sojourn here Miss Jean and in memory of those days I     venture to ask you if I may call at the manor tomorrow     about four oclock     Yours     VALENTINE FARROnce twice Jean read it through then mechanically folded the bit ofpaper and fitted it into the envelope carefully A tremulousincredulous joy was dawning on her face She felt oppressed andstarted to her feet It surprised her to find that she was tremblingso she could not stand She laughed a little hysterically as shesank back on the windowseat Then suddenly she flung out her handsand slipping down on her knees buried her face in the soft cushionsand a storm of weeping shook the slender figure In her despair shehad been silent tearless but in this awakening of hope within herher pentup feelings found relief in tears A wild almostunreasonable joy was growing in her heart and her quivering lipswere pressed passionately to her lovers letter Her faith in himwhich Helens words had so cruelly crushed was fast springing intolife againWhen at length the strength of her emotion had worn itself away shelifted her head and rising slowly to her feet leaned against thecasement and looked thoughtfully out upon the peaceful scene The sunwas setting and the western horizon was one blaze of golden gloryJeans grave eyes seemed asking counsel of the far illumined sky Oncea deep sigh trembled through her lips and the thought that promptedit almost formed itself in wordsOh if only my mother were here I could not ask advice of anyoneelse but I think I could speak to herFor a long time Jean stood there silent motionless and when at lastshe moved away the crimson light had quite faded and a soft violethaze lingered in the western sky She crossed the room and seatedherself at the open desk For a moment she hesitated holding her penpoised above the sheet of paper then bent her head and wroterapidly     MY DEAR MR FARR     I shall be at home tomorrow afternoon and shall be very     glad to see you I am sorry to learn that you are about to     leave Hetherford and somewhat surprised also as I had no     idea that your departure was imminent     Yours very sincerely     JEAN LAWRENCEThe written words looked cold and formal and with a tender feeling ofcompunction Jean raised the bit of paper to her lipsI would be more kind dear if I dared she murmured softlyThe old Dutch clock in the corner of the hallway was chiming the hourof three the following afternoon when Jean opened the door of herroom and started to descend the wide staircase From below voicesfloated up to her and when she reached the landing she paused andleaning over the banisters looked down upon the girls who werestanding near the open front door Nathalie caught sight of her andsmiled blithelyDont you want to come with us Jean We are going over to the innfor a game of tennisJean shook her headI am going to be thoroughly domestic this afternoon she announcedwith a conscious little laughAt the sound of her voice Miss Stuart glanced sharply over hershoulder There flashed into her mind the recollection of Farrs noteto Jean the previous day She closed her lips tightly as she followedHelen and Nathalie out upon the veranda and was singularly silent asthey sauntered leisurely across the lawn When they were almost at thegates she turned to Helen a distressed expression on her lovelyfaceWould you mind very much if I should turn back I have had a slightheadache all day and the sun seems to make it so much worseHelen looked sympathetically around at herWhy no indeed dear I was afraid you were not feeling well youhave been so quiet By all means let us go right backBut Miss Stuart would not listen to such an arrangement and declaredwith quite the air of a martyr that she should proceed to the inn inspite of her headache unless Helen would do as she desired When atlast she had succeeded in ridding herself of her companions she drewa deep breath and turning walked hurriedly up the avenue She didnot quite see her way clear to prevent an interview between Farr andJean but she felt that if she were near at hand fortune might throwsome unlookedfor chance into her path She had kept them apart sofar Surely she must not fail now at the very end for the news of theVortexs departure had been spread abroad by Dudley with loudlamentationsA great stillness lay over the manor this warm August afternoon andas she ascended the veranda steps she heard clearly Aunt Helens softvoice calling to Jean from the floor aboveMy dear will you not come up and read to me for a while My eyesare troubling me so I dare not use them any moreMiss Stuart stood still and listened as Jean came slowly out from thedrawingroomVery well Auntie the girl responded halfheartedly and with animpatient sigh started up the stairsMiss Stuart waited a moment then crossed the veranda noiselessly andentered the house After a cautious glance about the drawingroom shestationed herself in one of the front windows which commanded theapproach to the manor The blinds were drawn to shut out the heat andglare and she turned the slats slightly to afford a view of thedriveway A faint breeze rustled the vines that trailed over theveranda rail and climbed the graceful columns The moments draggedslowly by Even Miss Stuarts active mind began at length to yielditself to the drowsy influence of the lifeless atmosphere themonotonous buzzing of the flies and the lazy twittering of the birdsas they rested idly on the branches of the elms or sailed languidlythrough the haze which softly enveloped the earth She flung one armabove her head and leaned back in her chair Her thoughts went backto those faroff happy days in Annapolis and a faint smile curved thelines of her mouth Dreamily her memories journeyed on toward thepresent and then once more her jealous wrath was awakened Shestarted up the more effectually to shake off the torpor that wasstealing over her and rising took one or two short turns up anddown the room pausing frequently at her post to peer out through thedrawn blinds Her vigil was a tedious one the result of it uncertainbut the warring spirit within her was now thoroughly aroused and herpatience did not flagWhat move can I make she asked herself again and again I cantvery well insist on playing an unwelcome third to their ttetteThey have been driven and they would outwit me there Ah well weshall see we shall seeThen a sharp exclamation broke from her for as she halted at thewindow she discovered Valentine Farrs erect figure swinging lightlyacross the lawn in the direction of the manor She turned the slatssoftly and crossed hurriedly to the entrance of the drawingroom andstanding there her hands holding the portires apart on either sideshe tilted her head forward straining every nerve to catch thefaintest sound from the floor above It was perfectly quiet and herface cleared a little Next her anxious eyes swept the halfdarkenedhallway as if in search of some suggestion but the widechimneyplace with its brass andirons agleam where the light touchedthem the old clock in the corner ticking slowly steadily offeredher no help The outer door stood ajar and leaning a little furtherforward she could see that Farr was within a short distance of theveranda Ah what should she do Her quick ear caught the sound of aheavy footfall ascending from the lower floor and while her eyes wereriveted on the spot whence the sound issued the swinging door in therear of the hall was pushed open and a woman toiled laboriouslythrough bearing in her arms a hamper of clean linen Miss Stuartsready mind sprang at once to the solution of the difficulty and whilethe thought formed itself she cleared the distance between themHer voice shook a little as she spoke for her heart was beating highin the hope of victoryPlease set your hamper right down here and go to the front doorThere is a gentleman just coming in Say to him that Miss Jean begs tobe excused that she particularly wishes to be excused Wellimperiously for the goodnatured woman was staring at her stupidlywith gaping mouth and astonished eyes Dont you understand me Putyour hamper down at once and do as I tell youThe woman obeyed her slowly and wiping her hands on her apron movedclumsily forward Farrs foot was already on the step of the verandaand Miss Stuart had barely time to push open the swinging door andconceal herself behind it when his clear quiet voice addressing thestrange servant broke the stillnessWill you please tell Miss Jean Lawrence that Mr Farr wishes to seeher She is expecting me I believeThe woman confused by her hurried orders and embarrassed by theunusual duty of waiting upon the door grew very red in the face asshe answered bluntlyShe says she wont see yer sirFarr stared blankly at herWhat Oh I think you must be mistaken Just take my message up toMiss Jean pleaseIn her hidingplace Miss Stuart clutched tightly at the folds of hergown and a look of desperation burned in her eyes But her fears wereunfounded The womans thickset figure barred the doorway and shestood her ground stolidlyIt aint no use sir She told me herself she pertickly wouldnt seeyou sirFarrs face went very white and without another syllable he turned onhis heel and strode awaySure I didnt say it just the same way yer told me Miss the womansaid apologetically as Miss Stuart opened the backdoor and confrontedher but I sent him away for yer well enough I guess and grinningbroadly she lifted her hamper and proceeded heavily up the stairsA moment later Miss Stuart quietly followed her congratulatingherself on the wonderful success of her maneuverIt was a masterstroke she said to herself triumphantly as sheclosed the door of her room Susie will never know that he calledfor I dont believe that stupid creature will mention the occurrenceAh how fortunate Mrs Denniss room is at the rear of the house andshe flung herself down on the lounge and closed her eyes wearily forthe excitement had worn upon herAt the same moment Aunt Helens door softly shut and Jean her facefull of glad expectancy ran lightly down the stairs More than anhour later she crept slowly up again all the joy gone out of herblanched face her sensitive lips quivering piteously despair andmisery in her eyesThe following morning the Vortex sailed Captain Dodd and Dudley hadcalled at the manor the evening before and in the merry little partyspeculations were rife as to the cause of Farrs desertion on thishis last evening in Hetherford Jean forced herself to sit quietly byand listen and her heart grew numb and cold Outwardly however hermanner was so natural and selfpossessed that Helen drew a deep breathof relief and persuaded herself that Jean could not be so veryunhappy                                   In the morning at an early hour Jean is on the upper balcony Shecrosses her arms on the rail and her eyes are fastened on the placewhere the Vortex lies at anchor Already her sails are set and inanother moment the loud boom of her cannon announces her departureThe girl shivers a little but does not stir from her position Nowthe schooner is sailing gallantly along the sun shining full on herwhite sails Ah how rapidly she nears the headland She is roundingit Now only the top of her tall masts can be seen above the rocksAh she is gone Jeans face drops on her crossed arms and a low crybreaks from her white lipsScarcely had the Vortex been an hour on her way when Miss Stuartpresented herself in Helens room and announced in tones of deepestregret that she would be obliged to leave them on the following dayMother has issued her commands she said dolefully and then as alook of incredulity dawned in Helens face she made haste to addand there are many reasons why it is much better that I should goHelen sighed but did not attempt to alter her friends decisionThat evening when the last farewell words had been spoken to thefriends from the inn and the parsonage Miss Stuart went up to herroom followed by the three Lawrence girls Helen and Nathalie went towork over her halfpacked trunks and Jean leaning against thefootboard of the bed looked on with languid interest Miss Stuartwho was complacently issuing orders to the two packers leaned lazilyback in an easychair her white hands folded idly in her lap Jeansurveyed her gravely but without bitterness This was the woman whomValentine Farr loved and much as she had suffered she was ready todo her full justice Suddenly Miss Stuart looked up and their eyesmet Jean moved forward and held out her handGoodnight and goodby Miss Stuart I am very tired and I fear Iwill not be up for the early train in the morning I hope you havebeen happy at the manor She broke off abruptly She knew that sheought to add I am sorry you are going but the words refused topass her lipsMiss Stuart rose and took the outstretched hand but she could notmeet Jeans clear gazeIt was late when the door closed upon Helen and her kindly officesMiss Stuart possessed by an intense restlessness paced up and downthe room Her thoughts were as accusing angels What return had shemade for the kindness and hospitality of these friends under whoseroof she had spent the last three weeks Her wicked pride and passionhad indeed sown the seeds of misery in one heart Of Jean she hadthought with shrinking but trusting faithful Helen caused her thekeener pang the sharper suffering It was not too late however Withone word she could undo the mischief she had so deliberately wroughtJust for one moment Miss Stuarts better self held sway softening herhard and jealous nature Just for one momentthen the impulse diedout and with a reckless laugh she drowned the voice of conscienceCHAPTER XVIIIA RIFT IN THE CLOUDSSeptember with its bright warm days and cool nights was at hand Thegayeties of the summer were a thing of the past and the little colonyof girls had settled down into the old routine of life exactly as weused to before the Vortex came Mollie Andrews said complacentlyNo voice was raised in contradiction and yet perhaps no heart quiteechoed the sentimentJean faced her trouble bravely and without complaint but the efforttold on her as the days passed by and she grew frail and slender andan expression of deep sadness lingered in her soft eyes but thechange in her took place so slowly so gradually that no one seemedto be aware of it As the days shortened they would spend theirevenings over the wood fire in the manor drawingroom reading aloudfrom some favorite book of poetry or prose Jean invariably found aplace on the divan in the corner and when someone rallied her on herlazy habit she only smiled faintly and nestled down among thecushions One cold gusty evening when the rain beat against thewindowpanes and the wind howled dismally about the house Eleanor tookup a volume of poems from the table and began to read a poem calledOenone Helens eyes unconsciously sought Jeans face It was halfturned away and one little hand made shift to shield it but Helendistinctly saw two great tears steal silently down from under theclosed lidsThis set her heart to aching and alone in her room that night shepondered long what could be done for her poor little sister In theend she penned a letter which in the morning she carried herself tothe postoffice and anxiously awaited the resultBefore October had wellnigh come around Jean was really ill so illthat Aunt Helen and even thoughtless Nathalie were seriouslyconcerned All day long she would lie on the sofa in her roomscarcely speaking save in response to some direct question that wasput to her and all through the long hours of the night her tired eyesnever closedI dont think she ever sleeps Nathalie confided to Helen one day ina troubled voice Whenever I speak to her she is always wideawakeand once or twice I have thought I heard her cryingHelen shook her head sadly and watched the mails with an increasingimpatience for the answer to her letter It came at last and when shehad read it through hurriedly she went at once to Jeans room andsitting down beside her took her cold little hands in hersDo you feel so badly today dear she said tenderlyNo Helen only very tiredThe sigh with which these words were spoken went right to HelensheartWould you like to go away where you would have a complete change ofsceneJean raised herself on her elbow and turned an eager eye toward hersisterOh yes I want to go away Its the only thing in the world I reallywant and oh I want it so very much Helen II cant stay hereHer voice dropped to a whisper Dont you see how hard it is for meHelen bent down and kissed herWell darling I have arranged it for you and I have only beenwaiting for this letter to tell you that it was all right You see Ididnt want to speak to you dear until everything was settled Nowshall I read you what the letter saysYesHelen drew the letter from her pocket and unfolded it     I am so sorry to hear that poor little Jean is not well It     is hard to imagine her otherwise than rosy and smiling I     think with you that probably a change of scene would do her     more good than all the medicines in the world and I see my     way clear at once to carry out your proposition My aunt     Mrs Fay crosses in the middle of October to join us here     in Paris and I want you to send Jean over with her The     ocean trip will be the first step toward recovery and you     must trust to our watchful care and the newness of her     surroundings to complete the cureHelen paused and Jean broke in hurriedly a faint color rising in herpale cheeksDear old Guy how like him always thoughtful always tender OHelen yes let me go I would be so glad to and I know it would dome goodWould you be happy with Guy and his mother JeanJeans sad eyes met her sisters for a moment and then were slowlyavertedI love them both dearly she answered gently and I want aboveeverything to go away from Hetherford Please help me to do thisHelen You will gain Aunties consentAnd with this reply Helen was fain to be content She had refrainedfrom reading aloud the closing lines of Guys letter which runningthus had made her heart beat strangely     Our plans are somewhat indefinite My aunt does not care to     spend more than two months over here and it is her     intention to return home at Christmas time If a stay of     this duration should effect Jeans cure she might return     with her for there is a chance that she may be homesick so     far away from you all It would be very pleasant to return     home at this sweet season My own thoughts turn that way so     often Helen can you never hold out any hope to me Must     this season of peace come and go leaving my heart as lonely     as ever Must I wait forever in strange lands for one word     from you Forgive me if I do wrong to write you thus but     your letter has undone me     Faithfully yours     GUY APPLETONIn less than two weeks Jean Lawrence sailed for Europe under the careof Mrs Fay A sense of desolation inwrapped the manor The weatherwas sharp and cold and the sweet warm summer seemed a dream and everylittle thing that recalled it gave the girls a pang Emily Varian haddeparted and both the Hills and Andrews were about to turn theirfaces citywardOne crisp morning when the wind blew fresh from the northwestEleanor came out from the inn with Cliff Archer at her side andstarted briskly forth in the direction of the parsonage Eleanorsface wore an expression of deep dejection and Cliff observing thismade comment on itYou are down on your luckEleanor smiled somewhat dubiouslyIt is in the air Cliff I dont know what is the matter with us allOur good spirits seem to have deserted us with JeanThere was a brief silence broken by Archer He spoke slowly as ifnot quite sure of his groundIt was in the air before Jean went away I think It strikes me thatshe was fully under its influence herselfEleanor shot a glance at her companionJean was not well you knowAnd there was a cause Come Eleanor let us be frank You may trustmy affection for Jean to keep me from prying into her affairs butsome things this summer were quite too patent to be disregardedI dont know what you mean Eleanor interposed hurriedlyOh yes you do It is natural for you to shield Jean because fromyour point of view she has been badly treated Well I dont agreewith you in that If ever a man was honestly in love that man wasValentine Farr I dont pretend to know what the trouble was betweenthem but I have a suspicion on general principles that jealousy wasat the bottom of it I dont believe that Jeans was well founded andI wish she had a friend who felt at liberty to tell her so I havekept silent for a long time too long perhaps but now I have set theball rolling and shall await resultsThey were in the parsonage grounds now and Eleanor paused and laidher hand lightly on Cliffs armI would do anything in the world for Jean as you know Cliff but Ifeel too much in the dark to take any step at present You may beright indeed I think you are but remember neither you nor I arequite sure of Jeans feeling on the subject and it is a very delicatematter to meddle withI would risk it smiled CliffAfter a moment he spoke again in a tone of deeper earnestnessA very grave trouble can arise from a slight misunderstandingEleanor I wish dear that you and I could put that possibility outof reach I have tried to be patient but when I see so much sorrowbrought about undoubtedly by a lack of frankness and confidence Itremble for our future If you do care for me dear why will you nottell me so Surely you cannot doubt the sincerity of my love for youEleanor raised her eyes to her lovers faceI think you know Cliff she began when Nans voice broke inupon themHello Now what are you two doing philandering in this secludedspotTalking of subjects quite beyond your ken my dear drawled ClifflazilyYou wont catch your train if you dont come down to mother earthlaughed NanArcher consulted his watch and then bade the girls a hurried goodbyand started off for the station Nan linked her arm in Eleanors andthey proceeded leisurely to the parsonage talking as they went Onesentence remained in Nans mind awakening there a long train ofthoughtThe summer is over Nan and we are about to disband We haveperhaps had more gayety and less real happiness than in the yearsgone by I think you know as well as I the reasons for this You arethe only one I think who could set some crooked matters straightSuppose you see what you can doEnigmatical as the words were Nan understood their purpose and whenon the last evening before the Andrews and the Hills were to leaveHetherford they assembled at the manor she had quite determined tofollow Eleanors suggestion It was a custom of long standing for NanMollie and Eleanor to spend the last night of the season with theLawrence girls to talk over the events of the summer and toanticipate the futureTonight as they gathered around the wide fireplace in thedrawingroom a certain sadness hovered over them subduing theirvoices breaking the conversation with frequent spaces of silenceTheir hearts were full of thoughts that were left unspoken Jeansabsence made itself strongly felt among them so closely was sheassociated with every like occasion in the pastNothing seems real without her said Eleanor drearily This partingis like no otherI hate partings anyway cried Mollie I am always so afraid that wewill not come together again quite in the old way     All things must change      To something new to something strangequoted HelenNow girls this is nonsense exclaimed Nathalie struggling withthe lump that would rise in her throat Jean is going to have asplendid time and will come home as strong and well as ever and atChristmas time you will all come up here and we will have a grandreunionNo answer to Nathalies cheerful prediction suggested itself andHelen made a welcome diversion by announcing that it was bedtimeNan will you share my room she asked as they were on their wayupstairsWell I should think so I particularly want to have a good talk withyou aloneThat is nice I am just in the humor for it tooWhen they had donned their wrappers Helen threw herself down on thesofa before the open fire and Nan knelt down on the hearthstone tostir the logs into a brighter blazeA cheerful fire is always inspiring to me she said explanatorilyI can talk so much better when I am thoroughly warm and cozyHelen smiled indulgentlyAll right Nan make yourself comfie and then talk to meThe flames were crackling up the chimney now and Nan settled herselfon the hearthrug with a sigh of satisfactionDo you think Jean will be happy so far away from you allShe wanted very much to go Helen replied evasivelyYes I know that Helen Jean was not happy before she went away Didyou not see itHelen did not speak and after a moment Nan resumed quietlyYes Jean was unhappy and yet Mr Farr loved her dearlyHelen sat up and looked at her friend in blank astonishmentWhy NanDear I couldnt help guessing it Indeed I dont mean to beimpertinent but I believe Mr Farr was in love with Jean and I cantbear to see everything going wrong when a little common sense wouldset it rightI am afraid it would take more than that Nan Mr Farr is in lovewith Lillian I think and probably he meant nothing by his attentionsto JeanHe may have been in love with Miss Stuart once but he is not nowdeclared Nan in a tone of convictionYou are mistaken Nan I am sure you areI think not returned Nan stubbornly I have had my eyes wide openand I believe I am rightThen why did he treat Jean so demanded Helen Toward the end ofhis stay here he hardly ever came to the manor and he went awaywithout even calling to say goodby In fact I dont think Jean knewthe Vortex was goingBut Nans opinion was quite unshaken She dropped her chin in her handand stared thoughtfully into the fireI will tell you something she said impressively The afternoonbefore the Vortex left I was on my way to the inn when from adistance I saw Mr Farr turn in at the manor gates You remember thatshortly after Bridget came over for me and I was so cross at havingto leave our game of tennisHelen nodded and Nan went onWell on my way over I saw Mr Farr come out from the manor groundsHis cap was drawn down over his eyes and so lost was he in his ownthoughts that he passed me on the other side of the road and did noteven see me There was something in his whole figure and bearingexpressive of disappointment and unhappiness Oh you neednt lookincredulous turning her head to scan Helens face A personscarriage is often most expressiveI wasnt looking incredulous Nan I was only wondering what pointyou were going to make out of all thisThat Mr Farr did go to the manor to say goodby to Jean I dontthink he could have seen her for from the time he went in the manorgates until he left them again he could only have walked to the doorand right back again without stoppingI know he didnt said Helen quietly for Jean told me so Shehesitated a moment then added Lillian was at home that afternoonNans face grew downcastI dont believe he went to see Miss Stuart she persisted somewhatunreasonably I believe that there was some great mistake somewhereI knew she went on as Helen did not reply that Jean was surprisedto find that he and Miss Stuart were old friends He may not have toldher but that was probably accidental At any rate that was thebeginning of the difficulty and every incident from there on servedto widen the breach Jean thought she had been willfully deceived andMiss Stuart was not loath to lend herself to strengthen thatconvictionI dont see how you can blame Lillian objected Helen irritably Itwas not her fault that Mr Farr was in love with her I think theywere once engaged this last somewhat fearfully for she did not knowthat she was doing right to betray her friends secretNan shrugged her shouldersThat may be but it is only a greater reason why he is not in lovewith her nowThis bit of worldly cynicism struck on deaf ears for Helen wasrevolving many things in her mindThere are of course many things that I cannot attempt to explainNan continued but I still hold to my belief that Mr Farr cared forJean I like him and I dont believe he would ever have deliberatelydeceived herA brief pause ensuedNan said Helen I wish the Vortex had never come to anchorhere Everything has gone wrong since thenBe fair Helen Are you sure the fault lay there It seems to me thateverything went happily untilUntil when Go on NanUntil Miss Stuart cameHelen who had been halfsitting up with her head propped on herhand dropped back among the cushions with a heavy sighI dont know why you should think so You are prejudiced againstLillian and harsh in your thoughts of her I am not at all sure thatit is fairNan gained her feet and looked gravely down at her friendIs it not true dear Think Helen Have not many things gone wrongsince your acquaintance with Miss Stuart Oh I am sure of it quitesureUnbroken silenceAre you angry with me Helen Nan asked at lengthNo noMay I say something still further dearOf course I know you would never willfully be unkindNan sat down on the sofaThings have gone wrong since the day you met Miss Stuart and thereason is that you persisted in a friendship of which Guy so stronglydisapproved Tell me Helen was it not Miss Stuart who separated youfrom Guy Was it not on her account that you quarreledI suppose so but Guy was very strange and unreasonable and I likedLillian her friendship was very sweetO Helen you had known Guy all your life you should have relied onhis judgment you should have trusted him Do you think that for anylight or insufficient reason he would have thwarted you Had he notalways shown himself thoroughly unselfish in everything that concernedyou You did him a very cruel wrong when you mistrusted him Helenand I dont see how you could have been so cold when he loved you soFor answer Helen raised her eyes and looked at Nan through her tearsI want to help you to see what a mistake you have made Nancontinued gently You had grown used to Guy his devotion was such anold story that you thought you did not love him Miss Stuarts greatbeauty fascinated you and she soon found it easy to bend you to herwill Forgive me darling but this once I must speak bluntly Manyand many a time you would have gone back to your allegiance to Guy hadshe not willed it otherwise and had he poor fellow not taken theworst course for his cause It was foolish for him to go away but Guynever could bear halfmeasures Since then you have almost learned toknow Lillian Stuart for yourself Yet even to this day you blindyourself about her I sometimes am tempted to think it is simplybecause she is so beautifulHelen started up her face ablazeNan Nan you are unjust You despise me because I gave Guy up butI tell you I realized I did not love him before I ever saw LillianStuart I do love herPshaw interrupted Nan indignantly Guy Appleton is the best andtruest man in the world and you must have loved him if you had notbeen unduly influenced There dear dont be angry You know how fondI am of Guy and how keenly I took his disappointment to heart Heloved you so Helen and he was so miserablePlease spare me Nan murmured Helen brokenlyI cant spare you dear If your mistakes had simply made you sufferI would never have said a word but it is not so Miss Stuart hascrossed Jeans path and for her sake I have spokenIf it is true if I were sure of it I would want to dieDying would not do any good Live and some day it may be in yourpower to put an end to all this sorrowNan are you sure that Mr Farr is in love with JeanNot sure Helen but I think soWhat can I doNothing at present We must wait and see what happens Oh I am veryhopeful for the futureWhen they were in bed and the lights were out Nan ventured to askDont you think Guy will ever return to HetherfordI dont know dear Helen replied with a sound of tears in hervoiceNan longed to shake her to say You ought to know it depends solelyupon you why dont you do something about it but she felt she hadgone far enough for one night and turning over on her pillow fellfast asleepNan was only a countrybred lass and yet not all her separation fromthe world and from her fellowcreatures could shut her out from anunerring comprehension of human nature Her wide sympathies taught herto understand Helens coldness toward a lover whose one fault was thathe had demanded too little and yielded too much and she was toothorough an artist not to fully appreciate the wonderful spell thatbeauty such as Miss Stuarts casts upon certain naturesThe next day the rain came down in sheets and nothing drearier couldbe imagined than the Hetherford station where Helen and Nathalieawaited the arrival of their friends who were to depart on the trainwhich was now almost due Presently the old omnibus backed up to theplatform and from its damp interior the Hills and Andrews slowlyemerged their faces as gloomy as the leaden sky above as they wentthrough the irksome task of buying tickets and checking trunks Nancame rushing in upon the scene just as the train drew up at thestation There were a few hurried words of farewell and then with aclanging of bells and puffing of steam the train sped on its way tothe faroff city When the three girls clambered into the Lawrencesgreat closed rockaway they felt sorely tempted to give way to tearsand lamentations The horses splashed through the mud the rain beatagainst the windowpanes the east wind wailed and sighed through thetrees Nan got out at the parsonage and in silence the two sistersdrove on to the manor Nathalie threw off her hat and coat andseating herself at the big table in the center of the hallway begana long letter to Jean From the fireside Helen watched her for a fewmoments and then mounted slowly to her room feeling too dispiritedfor even Aunt Helens societyBy and by a soft little voice from without begged for admission andshe opened the door and gladly drew Gladys into the roomBaby you are just the little girlie I wanted Sister feels very dulland lonely todayMe too echoed Gladys as she climbed into her lapWell well that is too bad We shall have to comfort each otherWhat is comfort sisterComfort Dolly Why to comfort anyone is to try to make them happywhen something is troubling themAuntie says Ise her comfort Gladys affirmed with a wise littlenod of her headSo you are pet and not only Aunties but mine tooThe child nestled down contentedly in her sisters arms Her big eyeswandering about the room rested at length upon a large folding frameof photographs which stood on the mantelI wish Jeanie didnt go way she said in a pathetic little voiceWhat made you think of Jean dearCause I just was lookin at her pictureHelen lifted her eyes to the mantelSo you were We all miss Jean very much dont we darlingWhos that sister asked Gladys pointing to the photograph next tothe one of JeanDont you knowI kind of member but I aint sureHave you forgotten Mr Appleton GladysGuy Appleton queried Helenin a low toneOh now I member cried Gladys gleefully Dont you know thelittle kitty he gave me Larry harnessed her to my little wed cartan she wan up the willow tree with it And at the recollection thechild burst into a merry peal of laughterHelen laughed too in sympathy and then it came back to her hownicely Guy had spoken to the children telling them that what was funto them was suffering to poor kitty and impressing upon them howunkind and cowardly it was to be cruel to any living creatureThey talked on thus this big and little sister until twilight hadcome Then Helen put the child down from her lap and sent her off tothe nursery for her supper As she turned back into the room her eyescould just discern the outline of the frame upon the mantel butalthough the photographs within it were quite obscured by the duskGuys face rose before her with startling distinctness She droppedinto a chair and a dismal little laugh broke from herOh dear I wish Gladys and Nan had both kept still Now I dont knowwhat I do wantWeek followed week monotonously with little to mark the flight oftime save the arrival of letters from Jean and the Appletons Jeanwrote cheerfully declaring that she was much better and in excellentspirits but Mrs Appletons reports were much less encouragingJean never complains she wrote and seems filled with a restlessdesire to keep constantly on the move but she still looks veryfragile and I sometimes fear that all at once she will break downcompletely However you must not be anxious about her for perhaps Iam needlessly so Mrs Fay expects to return home at Christmas timeand I imagine that by then Jean will be quite ready to accompany herThe last week in November Helen went to town to spend Thanksgivingwith the HillsIt seemed almost selfish to take you away from Nathalie Eleanorsaid as they drove rapidly away from the station through the noisycrowded streets but I was longing for a sight of someone fromHetherford and I thought it would be such fun to begin to do ourChristmas shopping together A little later the shops are so terriblyovercrowdedThe first few days of Helens visit were passed chiefly in this wiseand partly because her time was so fully occupied and partly becauseof a curiously uncomfortable feeling which she could not shake offshe neglected to let Miss Stuart know that she was in town On thefourth evening after her arrival they dined at a famous restaurantwith an uncle and aunt of Eleanors and two youths of the jeunessedore Helen had felt very shy at first but this was fast wearingoff and she was talking quite naturally and pleasantly with hercompanion when a party of two ladies and half a dozen men entered theroom and selecting a table at a short distance from where Eleanor andher friends were seated grouped themselves about it their loudtalking and easy assurance attracting universal attention Helenstared at them a little curiously and then as one of the ladies drewoff her long tan gloves and let her gaze wander slowly around theroom she gave a sudden start At the same instant the ladys glancemet Helens and the recognition was mutual Miss Stuart gracefullyinclined her head a certain surprise in her eyes and Helen flushedcrimson as she returned the bowWhy there is Miss Stuart exclaimed Eleanor I cant imagine whyshe chooses such a companion as Mrs DesboroughAnd why should Miss Stuart be so particular laughed the man at herside It would be the pot calling the kettle black wouldnt itEleanor broke in hurriedly with some totally irrelevant remark butthe words had reached Helens ears The color died out of her faceand from that moment her companion found her silent and absentmindedAs they passed out of the restaurant Miss Stuart bowed smilingly toEleanor and turned a steady level glance on HelenWho were you bowing to asked Mrs Desborough from the other side ofthe tableTo Miss Hill and her friend Miss Lawrence Miss Stuart replied alittle stifflyWhat laughed the man at her side not that demure little girl whowas dining with Miss HillThe very same She is a great friend of mineOh come now dont tell me that You two never hit it off togetherMiss Stuart frownedYou will oblige me by not discussing the subject she returned in atone so unlike her usual careless flippant one that her companion wasimpressed by it I like her infinitely better than any woman I haveever knownBy Jove I believe you are in earnestDont believe anything she answered sharply and turning to the manon her left plunged at once into a reckless flirtationCHAPTER XIXA CABLEGRAMThe following morning a note came for Helen by a messenger It wasfrom Lillian Stuart and without a word of upbraiding for having beenkept in ignorance of Helens presence in town begged for a visit fromher prior to her return to Hetherford Helen was fully alive to thegenerous spirit thus shown toward her but it did not alter herdetermination to decline the invitation She worded her answer askindly as possible while making her meaning quite clear It hurt hercruelly to take this step and as she sealed the envelope there weretears in her eyesIt was Mrs Hills day at home and when after luncheon Eleanorreminded Helen of this fact the girl pleaded to be excused for shefelt far too depressed and out of sorts to meet people and to exertherself to entertain them Mrs Hill indulgently granted her requestand so she put on her hat and coat and started out for a walk Shestrolled down a beautiful avenue lined with fine residencessucceeded as she proceeded by richly and gayly ornamented shops Acrowd of people were passing up and down and the street at times wasalmost blocked with an innumerable throng of equipages When Helen hadreached a point where this avenue is intersected by another shecrossed the street and entered a square whose patches of grass andbare trees were a rest to her eyes after the rows of stately buildingsall about her Children were playing about on the smooth paths and asHelen looked at them she found herself longing for a sight of dearlittle Gladys round chubby face Across the street on the blockbelow a swinging sign caught her attention Its staring characterstold her that an art exhibition was being held within and she turnedher steps in that direction As she approached the showy andoverornamented doorway she glanced up at a man who was coming towardher Something in his gait and general bearing struck her as familiarAs he gained her side he raised his hat and she saw that he wasValentine FarrWhy Miss Lawrence he exclaimed this is a very great andunexpected pleasure I had no idea you were in town How are youOh very well thank you but with a sympathetic glance at his armwhich she saw he carried in a sling have you been hurt Mr FarrI had a fall aboard ship on our way to Fort Munroe and broke my armIt was badly attended to so I got leave to come home and have Dr naming a wellknown surgeon fix it up for meI am sorry said Helen looking at him with friendly eyesWhere were you going Miss Lawrence Farr asked as the surgingthrong crowded them close to the railing of a near houseI thought I would go in just above here and see the picturesWill you let me accompany you I would deem it a very great favor Ihave so many questions I want to ask you I want to know all aboutHetherford and everyone thereIndeed I wish you would and I will gladly satisfy your curiosityThere is not much to tell of Hetherford save that Jean has gone toEuropeShe tried to mention her sisters name quite naturally but the colorrose to her face and she could not bring herself to look at hercompanionTo Europe he echoed and could think of nothing further to sayI will tell you all about it when we are inside Helen said to himrather flurriedlyIn a moment more they found themselves in a softly lighted room thewalls of which were lined with paintings A few people catalogue inhand were slowly walking about or standing in groups of two or threebefore some painting of more than usual merit Helen gained courage toraise her eyes to her companions face and something in itsexpression made her direct her steps at once toward a huge red ottomanwhich occupied the center of the roomShall we sit down here and have our talk first her voice softlyinterrogated You can show me the pictures afterwardFarr looked at her gratefullyIt would be my wish Miss Helen but you mustnt let me bore youFor answer Helen seated herself and motioned him to take the placebeside herJean went to Europe in October She had not been at all wellandNot well he interrupted her with an anxious faceIn fact she was quite ill Helen went on gravely and she had anopportunity to join some friends of ours who were over there so wesent her in the hope that the change would benefit herAnd how is she nowSomewhat better I think but not very strong yetI am deeply grieved he answered in a voice which his best effortscould not keep very steadyThere was a brief silence during which Farrs eyes were fixed moodilyon the carpetI called to see your sister he began at length the day before weleft Hetherford but she excused herselfI dont think Jean knew of your visitYou are mistaken he returned bitterly The servant who admitted mehad received orders that Miss Jean would not see me and she made thatfact patent to me beyond the possibility of any doubtI cannot help that said Helen her determination to pursue thesubject struggling against a sudden timidity I am sure you arewrong I remember the afternoon perfectly Nathalie and I had been tothe inn and when we reached home I found Jean on the sofa in herroom and I asked her if anyone had called and she said noA puzzled expression crossed Farrs faceIt is very strange Why Miss Helen I wrote and asked your sister ifshe would see me and she replied that she would be at home at thehour I mentioned in my noteAll at once there flashed through Helens mind a recollection whichsuggested a most cruel suspicion Farr was looking straight at herhis honest eyes demanding an honest answerI cannot explain it Mr Farr she said slowly but I feelperfectly safe in answering you that it was all a mistake and thatJean never knew of your call at the manorAnd what of the message the servant gave me Forgive me Miss Helenif I seem to press you but this is no light matter to meI am quite sure that Jean never gave that message although I cangive you no further explanation of the matterFarrs face went very white and as Helen looked at him she saw howmuch the past few months had changed him There were deep lines abouthis mouth and his grave eyes were immeasurably sad Her heart wentout to him in sudden sympathy and she spoke to him with a touch oftenderness in her voiceJean will be with us again at Christmas time I hope and then youmust see her and let her explain to you how such a mistake was madeFarr rested his elbow on his knee and dropped his head in his handIf I only felt sure you were right Miss Helen He paused a momentthen resumed with deep earnestness I cared so much for your sisterthat the sudden withdrawal of her friendship was a bitter blow to meHelens eyes were downcast her lips refused to speak The silence wasbroken by FarrI think at one time I dreamed she cared for me a little but myillusion was quickly dispelledAnother pause of briefer duration and then he turned to his companionwith a question on his lipsHow was it Miss Helen Did I presume too much on your sisterskindness to me I suppose I must have although it seems to me that Ihardly deserved her excessive coldness and dislikeHelen thus put to the test looked straight up at him and answered alittle tremulouslyMr Farr Jean always liked youHe drew a quick sharp breathWhy do you think so he asked Then before Helen could reply hewent on in a strained voice I loved Jean with all my heart and wasabout to ask her to be my wife I love her nowI shall always loveherAnd Jean cares for you Helen whispered so low he had to bend hishead to catch the wordsCares for me he repeated a sudden light in his eyes his voicegrown very deep and tenderYes oh yes There must have been some wretched mistake which can beexplained away I dont know how it was she went on with aplaintive smile Jeans heart was almost broken because of you andshe grew so ill we had to send her awayThank God he ejaculated solemnlyHelen broke into a little laugh which was full of tearsThat Jean has gone away she queriedFarr lifted his head and drew a deep breathI cant thank you Miss Helen I seem to have no words to express toyou what you have done for me today Indeed it seems as if Fate foronce had chosen to do me a kind turnAfter a little Helen said gentlyYou must come to the manor for Christmas Mr Farr I can think of nogreater happiness for Jean than to have you there to welcome her onher returnMiss Helen II cant realize it You His voice broke butafter a moment he resumed You are not holding out a vain hope tomeyou are sureHelen met his eyes steadily and he was reassured even before sheanswered gravelyQuite sure Mr Farr Do you think I would have spoken elseShe turned away her head and he saw a tear on her cheekI have tried to fill my mothers place to the girls but I wasblinded by personal interests and did not understand about Jean untiltoo late I dont think I could have borne it if it had not been putin my power to retrieve my mistakeFarr looked at her curiously a thoroughly puzzled expression on hisface He opened his lips to question her but suddenly changed hismind and closed them without having spokenHelen rose from the ottomanWe have not seen the pictures have we she asked in a lighter toneFarr stood looking down at her with earnest eyesMiss Helen if God is good to me if all goes well is there awelcome for me at the manorShe put out her hand to him and he held it tightly for a momentGod bless youSome minutes later they descended the wide stairs and passingthrough the outer door found themselves once more in the crowdedthoroughfare The short November day was drawing to a close the windwas keen and sharp and a flurry of snow filled the airNow Mr Farr I want you to put me in an omnibus please and youmust not come uptown with meThen as he demurred she added with a friendly smileMy mind is so full of thoughts I would really rather be alone for awhile You understand dont youShe turned on the steps of the omnibus to sayI will let you know about Jeans return and remember you are tospend Christmas with usAs if I could forget Farr murmured to himself as he strode awayhis face alight with a great happinessAs Helen rang the bell of the Hills cozy apartment the door wasopened from the inside and she found herself face to face withLillian Stuart From the drawingroom came the buzz of tongues andthrough the halfopen portires she could see quite a number of peoplestanding about Miss Stuart answered her unspoken thoughtDont go in there Helen take me to your room I want to speak toyou for a moment I have already made my call on the HillsHelen obediently led the way down the hall but her heart was veryheavy for she had no courage for another scene this afternoon Sheknew that the conversation must necessarily be painful and she madeevery effort to put off the evil moment but in vain Almost beforethe door was closed Miss Stuart beganNow Helen will you please explain to me why you must return toHetherford in such haste Surely your aunt can spare you to me for afew days I cant imagine how you could have planned to be in townand not to be with me for a little visitHelen flushed guiltilyI am so sorry dear she faltered Another time perhaps but now Imust go homeMiss Stuart started up loosening her fur boa impatientlyThat is absolute folly There is nothing to stand in the wayunless She broke off abruptly and her eyes searched Helensdowncast face Do you want to put an end to our friendship shecried sharply Is that why you act so strangelyHelen lifted her hand with an imploring gesture of dissentAnswer me Helen Am I not rightHelens head was bent still lower and she made no attempt to speakMiss Stuart watched her for a moment in silence and a slight quiverpassed over her face She came a step nearer and laid her hand on thegirls shoulderWho has influenced you against me Helen What has happenedWhy Lillian what makes you say that It is not fair simply becausein one instance I am unable to fulfill your wishesMiss Stuart withdrew her hand and her brow darkenedHelen Helen you disappoint me Let us have the truth at allhazards Tell me frankly would not your answer always be the samenow whenever I might ask you for a visitHelen shivered a little and she could not bring herself to meet thegirls eyes Presently Miss Stuart spoke again the effort to subdueall emotion rendering her voice cold and sternI understand You have withdrawn your friendship from me Oh nodoubt you have discovered the depth of my unworthiness and feelperfectly justified Content in your own moral superiority and inthat of your friends in general you have decided that it would bewiser to banish me from the inner circle Of course she went on witha bitter laugh you have not reached this conclusion alone Wouldyou mind telling me who has helped you to itThe taunting question stung Helen into a responseYou told me an untruth Lillian You deliberately deceived me Youcaused untold suffering to one who is very dear to me to what end Icannot imagine And this was your return for all the love and trust Ihad given youMiss Stuart turned a startled glance on HelenWhat do you mean she asked breathlesslyI have seen Mr Farr today and a good many things that have puzzledme have been made clear I am not judging you Lillian I amcompletely in the dark as to your motives I only know that you werenot honest with meSo you have seen Val Farr murmured Miss Stuart She flung back herhead defiantly Well what did he tell you of me I thought he wastoo much of a man to speak ill of a womanYour name was never mentioned Lillian I am not prepared to tell youwhat Mr Farr said to me Suffice it to say it proved the untruth ofwhat you led me to believe last summerMiss Stuart caught her breathI suppose that means that he is in love with your sisterWe will not discuss that please replied Helen with quiet dignityHer companion laughed but there was no mirth in the soundWell I could have told you that last summer I did lie to you aboutit The game is played out now and I have lost so there is nofurther reason why I should not tell you the truth I was jealous ofthat little sister of yours and I did everything in my power to keepher and Valentine Farr apart Placed in the same position I shouldundoubtedly repeat the offenseCruel and unwomanly as the words were there was something in herfriends voice which stirred Helen with a feeling of pity She roseand laid a gentle hand on Miss Stuarts armYou must not try to make me think badly of you dear I would so muchrather believe that you did not realize how much misery you werecausing Let us not speak any more of this LillianA sudden rush of tears dimmed Miss Stuarts eyesThe least I can do is to grant your last request Helen One thingmore I can do for you dearI can go You need never see me againThere was just a faint interrogation in the lowspoken words butHelen remained quite silent She was waging a bitter fight withinherself Everything pressed her into a renunciation of this friendshipwhich had cost her so dear Slowly there was awakening within her adeep knowledge of Guy Appletons character and with this knowledgecame a great longing to win from him the love which she had so lightlysacrificed While a vestige of this friendship remained Guy wouldnever take her to his heart and now her choice must be made Then shethought of Jean and Valentine Farr and the thought strengthened herconviction that only one path was open to her Raising hertearstained face she met Lillians eyes smiling sadly on herSo you find it hard to give me up Helen Are you sure it isnecessaryThe critical moment had come and involuntarily Helen put her handsbefore her eyes to shut out the beautiful face so close to her ownOur paths must lie apart Lillian dear but as long as I live I willremember you and pray for youThe silence that followed these words became oppressive and Helenstirred uneasily and stole a timid glance at her friend Miss Stuartsface was uplifted her wonderful eyes filled with unutterablesadness gazed mournfully into space If suffering can expiate a sinin that moment she fully expiated the wrong she had done to JeanAfter a while she turned and laid her hands on Helens shouldersI understand my dear and I do not blame you Goodby Andstooping she kissed her gently on the lips                                   Helen stood before the fire in the hallway of the manor two lettersin hand a thoughtful expression in her eyes In four days Jean andMrs Fay would sail for home and Guy had written Will you not sendfor me Helen I will never return until you doOh dear her thoughts ran why must it be left for me to decideIf Guy would only take it into his own hands and come I would be sogratefulPoor weak little woman It was hard for her to act for herself Howhappy she would be to find shelter in some safe harbor guided thereby a stronger hand than her own With one stroke of a pen she couldrecall Guy but the strangest shyness overmastered her She wanderedrestlessly about the house her heart as heavy as lead and not untildaylight was waning and the long winter evening closing in upon themanor did she finally start out for the telegraph office a bit ofpaper held closely in the hand that was tucked in her muff                                   In a hotel in Paris a party of people was assembled in a small privatesittingroom Against the walls their lids gaping were a number ofhalffilled trunks and in the paraphernalia that were scatteredaround was every indication of an imminent departure Mrs Fay andJean bustled busily about stowing away the many purchases which thiscity of shops had tempted them to make stopping now and then toconsult Guy as to some detail of the long journey which lay beforethem Poor Mrs Appleton watched them with homesick eyes She wastired of wandering about in strange lands hungry for a sight of thelittle vinecovered cottage which had been empty for so many wearymonths Surely no mother had ever given her son a greater love a moregenerous sacrificeI am a foolish old woman my dear she had said to him a few momentssince when he had looked up suddenly and had seen the tears in hereyes I suppose it is not unnatural that I should sometimes dream ofspending the last years of my life in my own homeGuy did not answer then It was a shock to him to discover how muchthis exile had cost his patient uncomplaining mother and as he satat the little table in the center of the room apparently absorbed instraightening out accounts he was facing the duty which had suddenlybeen made clear to himPoor mother he thought with tender compunction I have been aselfish bruteYet it was not easy for him to depart from the course he had markedout for himself for like many another man of strong character Guywas very obstinate One glance at his mothers face however made himashamed of his hesitation and he pushed away his papers and rose tohis feet while he framed the sentence which would determine theirreturn home Just at that moment there was a knock at the door and inresponse to Jeans brisk Entrez a servant handed her a cablegramin its blue wrapper addressed Appleton Continental ParisThree simple words the message contained but to the man who read themthey made all the difference between light and darkness between lifeand death The message read     Please come homeHELENCHAPTER XXPEACE ON EARTHGOOD WILL TO MENOn a most delicious day late in December there is an air of unusualbustle and excitement over the manor Outside the ground is coveredwith a deep mantle of glistening snow and overhead the winters sunshines cold and clear from out a vault of deepest blue Within thehouse wood fires are blazing on every hearth and the atmosphere isfilled with the fragrance of fresh flowers which Helens deft handshave just arranged in every available vase and bowlOnly yesterday the travelers from the other side arrived MrsAppleton supremely contented to be once more at home Guy with theanticipation of his happiness lighting his whole face and Jean sweetand brave as ever but with a deep sadness in her eyes and lookingsuch a frail and slender figure in her closefitting gownHelen and Nathalie had gone to town to meet them and had brought themto Hetherford for on the morrow all the old friends were to gather atthe manor for Christmas and the girls wanted one long quiet eveningwith Jean before the arrival of their guestsThis homecoming was very hard for poor Jean harder than she hadanticipated and when the first little excitement of her meeting withAunt Helen and the children was over it required all her courage tokeep her face bright and smiling her voice gay and cheery Everythingspoke to her of Farr and she sighed a little wearily as she realizedthat all her journeyings had lessened not one whit the pain at herheart As they gathered before the blazing logs in the drawingroomjust after dinner to talk over all that had happened since theyparted Helens loving heart detected the undercurrent of pathos whichran through all Jeans spirited accounts of her travels andadventures and she was tempted to speak just the few words whichalone could bring back the sunny lighthearted expression to Jeansface She resisted the temptation however for she had given Farr herpromise that his coming on the morrow should be a complete surpriseHe was to come out on an early train so as to secure a quiet hourwith Jean before the manor was invaded by its other guestsAnd now he is almost due and Helens heart beats fast and her eyeswatch Jeans every movement as if she feared to let her out of hersight All the morning they have been dressing the house withChristmas greens and Jean stands on tiptoe to fasten the last wreathover the fireplace when a ringing of sleighbells breaks thestillness of the snowy winters day Then there is a stamping of amans feet on the veranda and Helen opens wide the door to admitValentine Farr Jeans back is toward him and there is just a briefinstant while she adjusts the last nail to secure the wreath beforeshe turnsWhat a draught Why dont you close the she begins thenturning the hammer she is holding falls to the ground with a crashand her hand on her heart her eyes wideopen and startled shestands facing Valentine FarrIn another instant Helen has closed the door and disappeared into thedrawingroom and Farr has taken Jeans hands in his own and isspeaking to her in a voice grown very deep and tenderJean my little love have you no word of welcome for meThe blood rushes into her face then ebbs away leaving it even palerthan beforeAh I have frightened you sweetheart Farr cries contritely andyou are not very strong yet are you dear But I have waited such aweary while I have been so miserable for a sight of your sweet faceI could not wait to tell you that I love you Surely you must haveknown it long ago darlingJeans head droops lower and lower and she does not speakI want you to be my wife dear Farrs tender voice goes on Do youlove me JeanStill she is silent and Farrs face grows very whiteWhat is it Jean Are you angry with me for speaking to you soabruptly Oh my love my love dont tell me that you cannot care formeThen Jean raises her eyes and though the tears are shining in themthey are full of a great happinessI do love you dear with all my heart and soul she says very lowbut quite steadilyFarrs face above her is eloquent and for the moment they have noneed of words Then the tears brim over in Jeans eyes and with alittle tremulous cry she flings herself in his armsO Val I have been so miserableAnd Farr bending down kisses her tenderlyPlease God darling no misery will ever again come to you throughme                                   A few hours later they all gather about the long dinner table and inthe pause that follows upon their being seated old Mr Birdsallssweet and tremulous voice asks grace In simple heartfelt words hethanks God for the safe return of the travelers and asks his tenderblessing for one and all Every head is reverently bent and everyheart echoes the earnest prayerThis is a gala occasion and in its honor Aunt Helen presides at thehead of the table and Willie and Larry and even little Gladys arepresent With much ringing laughter and merriment the dinner hourpasses Jeans voice is as joyous as in the old days and Helenhearing the sweet sound is filled with overwhelming gratitudeI tell you girls Dick cries enthusiastically this is a proud dayfor me I feel that it is entirely owing to my watchful care of youall that these pleasant things have come to pass Jean my child didI not present Farr to youJean laughs and blushesOh I dont know Dick I am not quite clear about it If you did Iam deeply indebted and she turns a shy soft glance toward her loverIt was your humble servant Now there is a most appropriate way inwhich you may reward me and Dick holds a sprig of mistletoe highabove his headNo no What nonsense protests JeanYou may smiles FarrBut I dont want to she laughs saucilyPoor Dick exclaims Mollie sorrowfully and she jumps up from thetable to give him a sisterly hug and a kiss I declare it is a shameI shant see you so neglectedThank you my dear returns Dick with a grin that isnt quite thesame but it is very sweetOh dear sighs Nan as they push back their chairs and wander intothe drawingroom how queer it seems to have Helen and Jean engagedIt is all very amusing now but what will become of us next summer Iam afraid our compact is about at an endCliff who is standing near Eleanor bends down to whisper somethingto her and then pushes her gently into the middle of the room Shefaces the group before her with flaming cheeks and looks about herhelplesslyGirls I suppose I must confess I too am a traitor to ourcompactO Eleanor cries Jean excitedly and puts a tender arm about herCliff leans against the mantel as nonchalant and languid as ever buthis eyes rest on Eleanor with infinite pride and content The girlturns toward the others with a graceful gesture of appealAm I forgivenThey crowd about her with eager loving words of congratulation andthen when the confusion has subsided Nan begs their attention for amomentI have some news for youO Nan dont tell us you are engaged implores Mollie dolorouslyNan burst into a merry laughWhat an idea No indeed But girls and boys what do you think Emilyis marriedMarried they cry in one breathYes married to a very rich widower with gray hair and three bigchildren and oh lots of money and Nan almost chokes in her hasteto enumerate all these virtuesNow Nan be sensible and take a long breath and tell us all aboutit says NathalieWell he owns a fine place at B where Em lives and he knew herwhen she was a little bit of a girl He married and went to England tolive About two years ago his wife died and this fall he returned toB renewed his acquaintance with Em proposed to her andyesterday they were marriedWhat unseemly haste Mollie exclaimsNo not a bit of it They didnt mean to be married until spring butMr Hazletine was suddenly recalled to England on important businesswhich may keep him there several months and he was so unhappy atleaving Em that she consented to be married at once and go with himTo think of it I suppose now Emily will roll by in her carriagewear magnificent clothes and completely dazzle us with her jewels ofinestimable valueSo much the better Mollie rejoins Helen heartily Poor little Emhas tasted of poverty all her life Think what a relief it will be toher to have ample meansIt is fine cries EleanorAnd what in the world shall we do groans Nathalie with a comicalglance at Nan and MollieLaugh at their lovemaking and with the hansom driver be glad weare not in itO Nan you rowdy laughs JeanHelen rises and makes her way to the door closely followed by GuyI am going to say goodnight to Aunt Helen she whispers her eyesdrooping shyly under the steadfast gaze he bends upon herI will wait for you here dear he says and takes her hand in hisbut she blushes so painfully he lets it drop againFoolish little woman he sighs to himself Shall I ever reallypossess her heartIn a few moments she rejoins him and Guy puts his arm about her andleads her into the music room No lamps are lighted but thewindowshades are up and the moons soft rays shine through thepanes illumining mysteriously the great empty room Far away acrossthe snowclad landscape the slender spire of St Andrews pointsheavenward and through the windows of the church shines the red glowof a light within The scene is one of infinite peace and beauty andthe magic of the hour casts its spell over Helen and her lover asspeechless motionless they stand within the recess of the windowgazing out at the marvelous beauty of the nightBy and by Helen moves a little closer to her companionI have something to tell you Guy she murmurs and I havent thecourage to say itThe old doubt not yet dispelled pales Guys faceDont tell me you are going to send me from you again HelenThe girls heart throbs at the pain in his voiceNo no dear I want to tell you something so different I love youGuy her voice dropping to a whisper Please never leave me againHe holds her to his heart with a love the deeper for all the pain andwaiting finding a heaven in the sweet lips which meet his so franklyAnd even as they stand there the bell of St Andrews solemnlytolling the midnight hour ushers in the glad Christmas tideHelen says Eleanors voice from the doorway may we all come inWe think it would be so sweet if you would play our Christmas hymn onthe organ and let us sing it togetherHelen pushes back the curtain and steps forward an expression ofperfect rest on her gentle faceYes indeed I think it is a lovely ideaGuy opens the organ Helen steps into her place and Cliff brings alamp from the hall and places it nearbyVal Jean whispers to her lover there is just one sad thought inmy heart tonight I suppose it is the memory of Christs message ofpeace and love which makes me so sorrowful when I think of the bitterfeeling between your mother and yourself Do you think it will ever bein my power to help to overcome itWe will try together sweetheart and the great blessing of your lovewill make all life easier and better for meThen Helens hands strike the opening chords of the hymn and a hushfalls upon the little group and with one accord they move nearer theorgan and as the last bell of St Andrews dies slowly away theirvoices take up the glad refrain     It came upon the midnight clear     That glorious song of old     From angels bending near the earth     To touch their harps of gold     Peace on the earth good will to men     From heavens allgracious King     The world in solemn stillness lay     To hear the angels singFINISEnd of Project Gutenbergs A Colony of Girls by Kate Livingston Willard END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A COLONY OF GIRLS  This file should be named 410108txt or 410108zip This and
