573CHAPTER IIN WHICH I WHET MY FATHERS SWORDThe summer day was all but spent when Richard Jennifer riding expressbrought me Captain Falconnets challengeTwas a dayfall to be marked with a white stone even in our Carolinacalendar The sun reaching down to the mountaingirt horizon in thewest filled all the upper air with the glory of its departing and thehigher leaf plumes of the great maples before my cabin door wroughtlustrous patterns in gilded green upon a zenith background of turquoiseshot with crimson like the figurings of some rich old tapestries I hadonce seen in my fieldmarshals castle in the Mark of MoraviaBeyond the maples a brook tinkled and plashed over the stones on its wayto the nearby Catawba and its peaceful brawling and the evensong of apair of clearthroated warblers poised on the topmost twigs of one ofthe trees should have been sweet music in the ears of a returnedexile But on that matchless bridesmonth evening of dainty sunsetarabesques and brook and bird songs I was in little humor forrejoicingThe road made for the river lower down and followed its windings up thevalley but Jennifer came by the Indian trace through the forest I cansee him now as he rode beneath the maples bending to the saddle hornwhere the branches hung lowest a pretty figure of a handsome youngprovincial clad in fashions three years behind those I had seen inLondon the winter last past He rode gentlemanwise in smallclothes ofrough gray woolen and with stout leggings over his hose but he wore hiscocked hat atilt like a troopers and the sword on his thigh was a goodservice blade and no mere hilt and scabbard for show such as ourcourtier macaronis were just then beginning to affectNow I had known this handsome youngster when he was but a little ladhad taught him how to bend the Indian bow and loose the reedshaft arrowin those happier days before the tyrant Governor Tryon turned hangmanand the battle of the Great Alamance had left me fatherless Moreover Ihad drunk a cup of wine with him at the Mecklenburg Arms no longer agothan yesterweekthis to a renewal of our early friendship Hence Imust needs be somewhat taken aback when he drew rein at my doorstonedoffed his hat with a sweeping bow worthy a courtier of the great Louisand said after the best manner of Sir Charles GrandisonI have the honor of addressing Captain John Ireton sometime of hisMajestys Royal Scots Blues and late of her Apostolic MajestysTwentyninth Regiment of HussarsIt was but an euphuism of the time this formal preamble declaring thathis errand had to do with the preliminaries of a private quarrel betweengentlemen Yet I could scarce restrain a smile For these upcroppings ofcourtier etiquette have ever seemed to march but mincingly with the freestride of our western backwoods None the less you are to suppose thatI made shift to match his bow in some fashion and to say At yourservice sirWhereupon he bowed again clapped hat to head and tendered me a sealedpacketFrom Sir Francis Falconnet Knight Bachelor of Beaumaris volunteercaptain in his Majestys German Legion he announced with sterndignityHaving no second to refer him to I broke the seal of the cartel myselfSince my enemy had seen fit to come thus far on the way to his end insome gentlemanly manner it was not for me to find difficulties amongthe formalities In good truth I was overjoyed to be thus assured thathe would fight me fair that he would not compel me to kill him as onekills a wild beast at bay For certainly I should have killed him in anyevent so much I had promised my poor Dick Coverdale on that dismalNovember morning when he had choked out his life in my arms the victimfirst of this mans treachery and at the last of his sword So as Isay I was nothing loath and yet I would not seem too eagerI might say that I have no unsettled quarrel with Captain Falconnet Idemurred when I had read the challenge He spoke slightingly of alady and I did butYour answer Captain Ireton quoth my youngster curtly I am notempowered to give or take in the matter of accommodationsNot so fast if you please I rejoined I have no wish to disappointyour principal or his master the devil Let it be tomorrow morning atsunrise in the oak grove which was once my fathers wood field each manwith his own blade And I give you fair warning Master Jennifer Ishall kill your bullyragging captain of lighthorse as I would a verminof any other breedAt this Jennifer flung himself from his saddle with a great laughIf you can he qualified But enough of these by your leave sirsI am near famished and as dry as King Davids bottle in the smoke Willyou give me bite and sup before I mount and ride again Tis a longgallop back to town on an empty stomach and with a gullet as dry as MrGilbert Stairs witHere was my freshhearted Dick Jennifer back again all in a breath andI made haste to shout for Darius and for Tomas to take his horse andotherwise to bestir myself to do the honors of my poor forest fastnessas well as I mightLuckily my haphazard larder was not quite empty and there werepresently a bit of cold deers to eat and some cakes of maize breadbaked in the ashes to set before the guest Also there was a cup ofsweet wine homepressed from the berries the Indian scuppernong towash them down And afterward though the evening was no more thanmountainbreeze cool we had a handful of fire on the hearth for thecheer of it while we smoked our reedstemmed pipesIt was over the pipes that Jennifer unburdened himself of the gossip ofthe day in QueensboroughHave you heard the newest But I know you havent since thepostriders came only this morning The war has shifted from the Northin good earnest at last and we are like to have a taste of theharryings the Jerseymen have had since 76 My Lord Cornwallis is comeas far as Camden they say and Colonel Tarleton has crossed theCatawbaSo Then Mr Rutherford is like to have his work cut out for him Itake itJennifer eyed me curiously Grif Rutherford is a stout Indian fighterno West Carolinian will gainsay that But he is never the man to matchCornwallis Well have help from the NorthDe Kalb I suggestedAgain the curious eyeshot Nay John Ireton you need not fear methough I am just now this redcoat captains next friend You know moreabout the Baron de Kalbs doings than anybody else in MecklenburgI What should I knowYou know a dealor else the gossips lie most recklesslyThey do lie if they connect me with the Baron de Kalb or with anyother of the patriot side What are they sayingThat you come straight from the barons camp in Virginiato see whatyou can seeA spy eh Tis cut out of whole cloth Dick my lad Ive never tookthe oath on either sideHe looked vastly disappointed But you will Jack Surely you have notto think twice in such a causeAs between King and Congress you mean Tis no quarrel of mineNow God Save us John Ireton he burst out in a fine fervor ofyouthful enthusiasm that made him all the handsomer I had neverthought to hear your fathers son say the likeI shruggedAnd why not pray The kings minion Tryon hanged my father and gavehis estate to his minions minion Gilbert Stair So in spite of yourdeclarations and your confiscations and your laws against alienlandholders I come back to find myself still the son of the outlawedRoger Ireton and this same Gilbert Stair firmly lodged in my fathersseatJennifer shrugged in his turnGilbert Stairfor sweet Madges sake Im loath to say itGilbertStair blows hot or cold as the wind sets fair or stormy And I will saythis for him no other Tryon legatee of them all has steered so fine acourse through these last five upsetting years How he trims soskilfully no man knows A short month since he had General Rutherfordand Colonel Sumter as guests at Appleby Hundred now it is Sir FrancisFalconnet and the British lighthorse officers who are honored But lethim rest the cause of independence is bigger than any man or any mansprivate quarrel friend John and I had hopedI laid a hand on his knee Spare yourself Dick My business inQueensborough was to learn how best I might reach Mr RutherfordsrendezvousFor a moment he sat pipe in air staring at me as if to make sure thathe had heard aright Then he clipt my hand and wrung it babbling outsome boyish brava that I made haste to put an end toSoftly my lad I said tis no great thing the Congress will gain bymy adhesion But you Richard how comes it that I find you taking yourease at Jennifer House and hobnobbing with his Majestys officers whenthe cause you love is still in such desperate straitsHe blushed like a girl at that and for a little space only puffed theharder at his pipeI did go out with the Minute Men in 76 if you must know and smeltpowder at Moores Creek When my time was done I would have listedagain but just at that my father died and the Jennifer acres were liketo go to the dogs lacking oversight So I came home andandHe stopped in some embarrassment and I thought to help him onNay out with it Dick If I am not thy father I am near old enough tostand in his stead Twas more than husbandry that rusted the sword inits scabbard Ill be boundYou are right Jack twas both more and less he confessedshamefacedly Twas this same Margery Stair As I have said her fatherblows hot or cold as the wind sets but not she She is the fiercestlittle Tory in the two Carolinas bar none When I had got Jennifer inorder and began to talk of listing again she flew into a pretty rageand stamped her foot and all but swore that Dick Jennifer in buff andblue should never look upon her face again with her good willI had a glimpse of Jennifer the lover as he spoke and the sight wentsomewhat on the way toward casting out the devil of sullen rage that hadpossessed me since first I had set returning foot in this my nativehomeland Twas a life lacking naught of hardness but much of humanmellowing that lay behind the homecoming and my one sweet friend inall that barren life was dead What wonder then if I set thisfrankfaced Richard in the other Richards stead wishing him all thehappiness that poor Dick Coverdale had missed I needed little wouldneed still less I thought before the war should end and through thislovematch my lost estate would come at length to Richard Jennifer Itwas a meliorating thought and while it held I could be less revengefulDost love her Dick I askedAye and have ever since she was in pinafores and I a hobbledehoy inMaster Wythebys schoolSo long I thought Mr Stair was a later comer in MecklenburgHe came eight years ago as one of Tryons underlings Madge was eventhen motherless the same little wilful pratapace she has ever been Iwould you knew her Jack Twould make this shiftiness of mine seem lessthe thing it isSo you have stayed at home acourting while others fought to give youleisure said I thinking to rally him But he took it harder than ImeantTis just that Jack and I am fair ashamed While the fighting kept tothe North it did not grind so keen but now with the redcoats at ourdoors and the Tories sacking and burning in every settlement tisenough to flay an honest man alive Godamercy Jack Ill go Ive gotto go or die of shameHe sat silent after that and as there seemed nothing that a curst oldcampaigner could say at such a pass I bore him companyBy and by he harked back to the matter of his errand making someapology for his coming to me as the baronets secondTwas none of my free offering you may be sure he added But it sohappened that Captain Falconnet once did me a like turn I had chancedto run afoul of that captain of Hessian pigs Lauswoulter at cards andFalconnet stood my friendthough now I bethink me he did seemoveranxious that one or the other of us should be killedAs how I inquiredWhen Lauswoulter slipped and I might have spitted him and didntFalconnet was for having us make the duel  outrance But thatsbeside the mark Having served me then he makes the point that I shallserve him nowTis a common courtesy and you could not well refuse I love you nonethe less for paying your debts even to such a villain as this volunteercaptainTrue tis a debt as you say but I like little enough the manner ofits paying How came you to quarrel with him JackNow even so blunt a soldier as I have ever been may have some prickingsof delicacy where the truth might breed gossipgossip about a talewhich I had said should die with Richard Coverdale and be buried in hisgrave So I evaded the question clumsily enough as has ever been myhap in fencing with wordsThe cause was not wanting If any ask you may say he trod upon my footin passingJennifer laughedAnd for that you struck him Heavens man you hold your lifecarelessly Do you happen to know that this volunteer captain oflighthorse is accounted the best blade in the troopWho should know that better than I was fairly on the brink ofbetraying the true cause of quarrel but drew rein in time I care notif he were the best in the army I have crossed steel beforeand with agood swordsman now and thenAnan said Jennifer as one who makes no doubt And then But thistoepinching story is but a dry crust to offer a friend You spoke of alady who was she Or was that only another way of telling me to mind myown affairsOh as to that the lady was real enough and Falconnet did grosslyasperse her But I know not who she is nor aught about her save thatshe is sweet and fair and good to look uponYoungAyeAnd you say you do not know her Let me see her through your eyes andmayhap I can name her for youThat I can not Mr Peales best skill would be none too great for thepainting of any picture that should do her justice But she is smallwith the airs and graces of a lady of the quality also she haswitching blue eyes and hair that has the glint of summer sunshine init Also she sits a horse as if bred to the saddleTo my amazement Jennifer leaped up with an oath and flung his pipe intothe fireCurse him he cried And he dared lay a foul tongue to her you sayTell me what he said I have a good right to knowI shook my head Nay Richard I may not repeat it to you since youare the mans second Truly there is more than this at the back of ourquarrel but of itself it was enough and more than enough inasmuch asthe lady had just done him the honor to recognize himHis wordshis very words Jack if you love meNo the quarrel is mineBy God it is not yours he stormed raging back and forth before thefire What is Margery Stair to you Jack IretonI smiled beginning now to see some peephole in this millstone ofmysteryMargery Stair She is no more than a name to me I do assure you thedaughter of the man who sits in my fathers seat at Appleby HundredBut you are going to fight for her he retortedAm I I pledge you my word I did not know it But in any case I shouldfight Sir Francis Falconnet aye and do my best to kill him too Sityou down and fill another pipe Whatever the quarrel it is mineMayhap but it is mine too he broke in angrily At all eventsIll see this kings volunteer well hanged before I second him in such acauseThat as you choose But you are bound in honor are you notNo He filled a fresh pipe lighted it with a coal from the hearthand puffed away in silence for a time When he spoke again it was not asFalconnets next friendWhat you have told me puts a new face on the matter Jack Sir Francismay find him another second where he can If he has aught to say Ishall tell him plain he lied to me about the quarrel as he did Now whois there to see fair play on your side John IretonAt the question an overwhelming sense of my own sorry case grappled meFifteen years before I had left Appleby Hundred and my native provinceas well befriended as the son of Roger Ireton was sure to be And nowDick my lad I am like to fight alone said IHe swore again at that and here lest I should draw my loyal Richard ashe was not let me say once for all that his oaths were but theoutgushings of a warm and impulsive heart rarely bitter and never asI believe backed by surly rancor or conscious irreverenceThat you shall not Jack he asserted stoutly I must be agallopnow to tell this kings captain to look elsewhere for his next friendbut tomorrow morning Ill meet you in the road between this and theStair outlands and well fare on togetherAfter this he would brook no more delay and when Tomas had fetched hishorse I saw him mount and ride away under the lowhangingmapleswatched him fairly out of sight in the green and gold twilightof the great forest before turning back to my lonely hearth and itssomber remindersI stirred the dying embers throwing on a pine knot for better lightThen I took down my fathers sword from its deerhorn brackets over thechimneypiece and set myself to fine its edge and point with a bit ofScotch whinstone It was a good blade a true old Andrea Ferara got inbattle in the seventeenth century by one of the Nottingham IretonsI whetted it well and carefully It was not that I feared my enemysstrength of wrist or tricks of fence but fighting had been my tradeand he is but a poor craftsman who looks not well to see that his toolsare in order against their time of usingIIWHICH KNITS UP SOME BROKEN ENDSIt was in the autumn of the year 64 as I was coming of age that myfather made ready to send me to England Himself a conscience exile fromEpiscopal Virginia and a descendant of those Nottingham Iretons whosebestknown son fought stoutly against Church and King under OliverCromwell he was yet willing to humor my bent and to use the interest ofmy mothers family to enter me in the kings serviceAccordingly I took ship at Norfolk for home as we called it in thosedays and after a stormy passage and overmuch waiting as my cousinsguest in Lincolnshire had my pair of colors in the Scots Blues latelyhome from garrison duty in the CanadasOf the life in barracks of a young ensign with little wit and lesswisdom and with more guineas in his purse than was good for him theless said the better But of this you may like to know that what with agood fathers example and some small heritage of Puritan decency comedown to me from the soundhearted old Roundhead stock I won out ofthat devils sponginghouse an army in the time of peace with somewhatless to my score than others had to theirsIt was in this barrack life that I came to know Richard Coverdale andhis evil genius the man Francis Falconnet Coverdale was an ensign inmy own regiment and we were sworn friends from the first His was aclean soul and a brave and it was to him that I owed escape from manyof the grosser chargings on that score abovenamedAs for Falconnet he was even then a ruffler and a bully though he wasnot of the army He was a younger son and at that time there were twolives between him and the baronetcy but with a mothers bequeathings topurchase idleness and to gild his iniquities he was a fair example ofthe jeunesse dore of that England a libertine a gamester arakehell brave as the tiger is brave and to the full as pitiless Hewas a boon companion of the officers mess and for a timeandpurposeposed as Coverdales friend and mineSince I would not tell my poor Dicks story to Richard Jennifer I maynot set it down in cold words here for you It was the ageold tragiccomedy of a false friends treachery and a womans weakness a duel andthe wrong man slain And you may know this that Falconnets mostmerciful role in it was the part he played one chill November morningwhen he put Richard Coverdale to the wall and ran him throughAs you have guessed I was Coverdales next friend and second in thisaffair and but for the upsetting news of the Tryon tyranny inCarolinanews which reached me on the very day of the meetingIshould there and then have called the slayer to his accountHow my father who Presbyterian and Ireton though he was had alwaysbeen of the kings side came to espouse the cause of the Regulatorsas they called themselves I know not In my youthful memories of him hefigures as the feudal lord of his own domain more absolute than many ofthe petty kinglings I came afterward to know in the German marches Butthis too I remember that while his rule at Appleby Hundred was sternand despotic enough he was ever ready to lend a willing ear to any taleof oppression And if what men say of the tyrant Tryons taxgatherersand lawcourt robbers be no more than half truth there was need for anyhonest gentleman to oppose themWhat that opposition came to in 71 is now a tale twice told Taken inarms against the governors authority and with an estate well worthreceiving my father had little justice and less mercy accorded himWith many others he was outlawed his estates were declared forfeit anda few days later he with Benjamin Merrill and four more captivated atthe Alamance was given some farce of a trial and hangedWhen the news of this came to me you may well suppose that I had noheart to continue in the service of the king who could sanction andreward such villainies as these of the butcher William Tryon So I threwup my lieutenants commission in the Blues took ship for the Continentand after wearing some halfdozen different uniforms in Germany waslucky enough to come at length to serviceable blows under my oldfieldmarshal on the Turkish frontierTo you of a younger generation born in the day of swift mailcoachesand wellkept postroads the slowness with which our laggard newstraveled in that elder time must needs seem past belief It was early inthe year 79 before I began to hear more than vague campfire tales ofthe struggle going on between the colonies and the mother country andfrom that to setting foot once more upon the soil of my native Carolinawas still another yearWhat I found upon landing at New Berne and saw while riding a jogtrotthence to the Catawba was a province rent and torn by partizan warfareThough I came not once upon the partizans themselves in all that longfaring there were trampled fields and pillaged houses enough to serveas milestones and in my native Mecklenburg a mine full charged withslowmatch well alight for its firingCharleston had fallen and Colonel Tarletons outposts were alreadywidespread on the upper waters of the Broad and the Catawba Thus it wasthat the first sight which greeted my eyes when I rode intoQueensborough was the familiar trappings of my old service and I wasmade to know that in spite of Mr Jeffersons boldly written Declarationof Independence and that earlier casting of the kings yoke by thepatriotic Mecklenburgers themselves my boyhood home was for the momentby swordright a part of his Majestys province of North CarolinaYou are not to suppose that these things moved me greatly As yet I waschiefly concerned with my own affair and anxious to learn at first handsthe cost to me of my fathers connection with the RegulatorsTouching this I was not long kept in ignorance Of all the vast demesneof Appleby Hundred there was no roof to shelter the son of the outlawedRoger Ireton save that of this poor hunting lodge in the mighty forestof the Catawba overlooked with the few runaway blacks inhabiting itin the intaking of an estate so large that I think not even my fatherknew all the metes and bounds of itI shall not soon forget the interview with the lawyer in which I wastold the inhospitable truth Nor shall I forget his truculent leer whenhe hinted that I had best be gone out of these parts since it was notyet too late to bring down the sentence of outlawry from the father tothe sonIt was well for him that I knew not at the time that he was GilbertStairs factor For I was mad enough to have throttled him where he satat his writing table matching his long fingers and smirking at me withhis evil smile But of this man more in his time and place His name wasOwen Pengarvin I would have you remember itFor a week and a day I lingered on at Queensborough for what I knewnot save that all the world seemed suddenly to have grown stale andprofitless and my life a thing of small account One day I would beminded to go back to my old fieldmarshal and the keeping of the Turkishborder the next I would ride over some part of my stolen heritage andswear a great oath to bide till I should come to my own again And onthese alternating days the storm of black rage filled my horizons and Ibecame a derelict to drive on any rock or shoal in this uncharted sea ofwrathOn one of these gallops farthest afield I chanced upon the bridlepaththat led to our old hunting lodge in the forest depths Tracing the pathto its end among the maples I found the cabin so lightly touched bytime that the mere sight of it carried me swiftly back to those happydays when my father and I had stalked the whitetailed deer in the hillglades beyond with this logbuilt cabin for a restcamp I spurred upunder the lowhanging trees The door stood wide and a thin wreath ofblue smoke curled upward from the mouth of the wattled chimneyThen and there I had my first welcome home Old black Dariusold when Ihad last seen him at Appleby Hundred and a very grandsire of ancientsnowwas one of the runaways who made the forest lodge a refuge He hadbeen my fathers bodyservant and notwithstanding all the years thatlay between he knew me at onceThereupon as you would guess I came immediately into some smallportion of my kingdom Though Darius was the patriarch the other blackswere also fugitives from Appleby Hundred and for the son of RogerIreton there was instant vassalage and loyal service But best of allon my first evening before the handful of fire in the great fireplaceDarius brought me a package swathed in many wrappings of Indiantanneddeerskin It contained my fathers sword and more precious than thisa message from the dead My fathers farewell was written upon a leaftorn from his journal and was but a hasty scrawl I here transcribe it     My Son     I know not if this will ever come into your hands but it and     my sword shall be left in trust with the faithful Darius We     have made our illtimed cast for liberty and it has failed and     tomorrow I and five others are to die at the ropes end I     bequeath you my swordtis all the tyrant hath left me to     deviseand my blessing to go with it when you or another     Ireton shall once more bare the true old blade in the sacred     cause of liberty     Thy father          Roger IretonYou may be sure I conned these few brave words till I had them well byheart and later when my voice was surer and my eyes less dim Isummoned Darius and bade him tell me all he knew And it was thus Ilearned what I have here set down of my fathers endThe next day all indecision gone I rode to Queensborough to ascertainif so I might how best to throw the weight of the good old Andrea intothe patriot scale meaning to push on thence to Charlotte when I had gotthe bearings of the nearest patriot forceTwas none so easy to learn what I needed to know though now I soughtfor information a curious thing or two developed One was that thislighthorse outpost in our hamlet was far in advance of the army ofinvasionso far that it was dangersomely isolated and beyond supportAnother was the air of secrecy maintained and the holding of the troopin instant readiness for fight or flightWhy this little handful of British regulars should stick and hang so farfrom Lord Cornwalliss main which was then well down upon the WatereeI could not guess But for the secrecy and vigilance there were goodreasons and sufficient The patriot militia had been called out and wasembodying under General Rutherford but a few miles distant nearCharlotteI had this information in guarded whispers from mine host of the tavernand was but a moment free of the taproom when I first saw MargeryStair and so drank of the cup of trembling with madness in its leesShe was riding unmasked down the high road not on a pillion as mostwomen rode in that day but upon her own mount with a black groom twolengths in the rear I can picture her for you no better than I couldfor Richard Jennifer but this I know that even this first sight of hermoved me strangely though the witching beauty of her face and theproudness of it were more a challenge than a beckoningA blades length at my right where I was standing in front of thetavern three redcoat officers lounged at ease and to one of them mylady tossed a nod of recognition half laughing half defiant I turnedquickly to look at the favored one He stood with his back to me a manof about my own bigness heavybuilt and wellmuscled He wore abobwig as did many of the troop officers but his uniform wastailorfine and the hand with which he was resettling his hat wasbejeweledovermuch bejeweled to my tasteSomething half familiar in the figure of him made me look again In theact he turned and then I saw his facesaw and recognized it thoughnine years lay between this and my last seeing of it across the body ofRichard CoverdaleSo thought I My time has come at last And while I was yet turningover in my mind how best to bait him the lady passed out of earshotand I heard him say to the two his comrades that foul thing which Iwould not repeat to Jennifer a vile boast with which I may not soil mypage here for youOh come Sir Frank thats too bad cried the younger of the twainand then I took two strides to front him fairlySir Francis Falconnet you are a foullipped blackguard I said andlest that should not be enough I smote him in the face so that he felllike an ox in the shamblesIIIIN WHICH MY ENEMY SCORES FIRSTTrue to his promise Richard Jennifer met me in the cool gray birthlightof the new day at a turn in the river road not above a mile or two fromthe rendezvous and thence we jogged on togetherAfter the greetings which as you may like to know were gratefulenough on my part I would fain inquire how the baronet had taken hisseconds defection but of this Jennifer would say little He had brokenwith his principal whether in anger or not I could only guess and oneof Falconnets brother officers that younger of the twain who had criedshame at the baronets vile boast was to serve in his steadIt was such a daydawn as I have sometimes seen in the Carpathians cooland clear but with that sweet dewy wetness in the lower air whichwashes the overnight cobwebs from the brain and is both meat and drinkto one who breathes it On the left the road was overhung by thebordering forest and where the branches drooped lowest we brushed thefragrance from the wildgrape bloom in passing On the right the riverlate in flood eddied softly and sounds other than the murmuring of thewaters the matin songs of the birds and the dustmuffled hoofbeats ofour horses there were none Peace deep and abiding was the keynote ofnatures morning hymn and in all this sylvan byway there was naughtremindful of the fierce internecine warfare aflame in all thecountryside Some rough forging of this thought I hammered out forJennifer as we rode along and his laugh was not devoid of bitternessOld Mother Nature ruffles her feathers little enough for any teapottempest of ours he said But speaking of the cruelties we provincialsavages as my Lord Cornwallis calls us have no monopoly Thepostriders from the south bring bloodcurdling stories of ColonelTarletons doings Tis said he overtook some of Mr Lincolnsreinforcements come too late They gave battle but faintheartedlybeing all unready for an enemy and presently threw down their arms andbegged for quarterbegged and were cut down as they stoodFaugh said I That is but hangmans work And yet in London I heardthat this same Colonel Tarleton was with Lord Howe in Philadelphia andwas made much of by the ladiesJennifers laugh was neither mirthful nor pleasantTis a weakness of the sex he scoffed The women have a fondness fora man with a dash of the brute in himI laughed also but without bitternessYou say it feelingly Do you speak by the bookAye that I do Now here is my lady Madge preaching peace and allmanner of patience to me in one breath and upholding in the next thisbaronet captain who though I would have seconded him at a pinch is buta pattern of his brutal colonelI put two and two togetherSo Falconnet is on terms at Appleby Hundred is heOh surely Gilbert Stair keeps open house for any and all of thewinning hand as I told youThe thought of this unspoiled young maiden having aught to do with sucha thriceaccursed despoiler of women made my blood boil afresh and inthe heat of it I let my secret slip or rather some small part of itSir Francis had ever a sure hand with the women I said and then Icould have bitten my masterless tongueSo queried Jennifer Then this is not your first knowing of himNo So much I said and no moreWe rode on in silence for a little space and then my youthling mustneeds break out again in fresh beseechingsTell me what you know of him and what it was he said of Madge heentreated You cant deny me now JackI can and shall It matters not to you or to any what he is or hasbeenWhyBecause as God gives me strength and skill I shall presently run himthrough and so his account will be squared once for all with allmenand all women as wellGod speed you quoth my loyal ally I knew not your quarrel with himwas so bitterIt is to the deathSo it seems In that case if by any accident heI divined what he would say and broke in upon himNay Dick if he thrusts me out you must not take up my quarrel Iknow not where you learned to twirl the steel or how but you may besure he would spit you like a trussed fowl in the first bout I haveseen him kill a man who was reckoned the best short sword in my oldregiment of the BluesContent yourself said my young Hotspur grandly If you spare him heshall answer to me for that thing he said of Madge Stair this though Iknow not what it was he saidI smiled at his fuming ardor and glancing at the pair of pistolshanging from his saddlebow asked if he could shootIndifferent wellThen make him challenge you and choose your own weapon Tis your onlyhope and poor enough at that I fear I have heard he can clip aguinea at ten pacesFrom that we fell silent again being but a little way from therendezvous and so continued until at a sudden turn in the road wecame in sight of a rude barricade of felled trees barring the wayJennifer saw it first and pulled up short loosing his pistols in theircases as he drew reinWare the wood he said sharply and none too soon for even as hespoke the glade at our left filled as by magic with a motley troopdeploying into the road as to surround usNow who are these I asked friends or foesFoes who will hang you in your own halter strap Jan HowartsToriesthe same that burned the Westcotts in their cabin a fortnightsince Will your horse take that barricade think youAyestanding if need beThen at them in Gods name ChargeIt needed but the word and we were in the thick of it I remembered myold fieldmarshals maxim Von Feinden umringt ist die Zeit zuzerschmettern and truly being so plentifully outnumbered we didstrike both first and hardA line of the ragged horsemen strung itself awkwardly across the road toguard the flimsy barricade and at this we charged stirrup to stirrupIn the dash there was a scattering volley from the wood answeredinstantly by the bellowings of Jennifers great pistols and then wecame to the steelIt was my first fleshing of the good old Andrea and a better balancedblade I had never swung in handtohand mellay As we closed with thehalfdozen defenders of the barrier Jennifer reined aside to give meroom to play to right and left and in the midst of it went nigh todeath because he held his hand to watch a cut and double thrust of mineOver with you I shouted pricking the man who would have mowed himdown with a great scythe handled as a swordOur horses took the barrier in a flying leap straining themselves forthe race beyond When we had pulled them down to a foot pace we weresafely out of rifle shot and there was space to count the costThere was no cost worth counting A saddle horn bulletshattered for meand the back of Jennifers sword hand scored lightly across by anotherof the random missiles summed up our woundings Dick whipped out hiskerchief to twist about the scored hand while I glanced back to see ifany Tory cared to followLord Jack I owe you one to keep and one to pay back quoth myyoungster warmly I never saw a swordsman till this dayMere tricks Dick my lad I have had fifteen years in which to learnthem And these were but country yokels armed with farming tools Thetwo with swords had little wit to use themOh come said he I know a pretty bit of sword play when I see itIf we come whole out of this adventure with the baronet you shall teachme some of these mere tricks of yoursI promised glancing back toward the dustveiled barrier in thedistanceDick you passed this way an hour ago was that breastwork in the roadthenNot a stick of itThen we may dare say our volunteer captain fights unwillinglyHow so he demanded being much too straightforward himself to suspectduplicity in othersTis plain enough This was a trap meant to stop or delay us and Illwager high it was the baronet who set and baited it It would please himwell to be able to say what our failure to come would give him warrantfor Let us gallop a bit lest we be late and so play into his handJennifer smiled grimly and gave his horse the rein I think youdcharge the Fall of Man to him if that would give you better leave tokill him Id hate to own you for my enemy John IretonFor all our swift speeding we were yet a little late at the rendezvousunder the tall oaks When we came on the ground the baronet was walkingup and down arm in arm with his second a broadshouldered young Britonfair of skin and ruddy of faceIf Falconnet had set the Tory trap for us he veiled his disappointmentat its failure His face dark and inscrutable as it always was wasmade more sinister by the plasters knitting up his broken cheek but Iwas right glad to make sure that my blow had spared his eyes Richly ashe deserved his fate I thought it would be ill to think on afterwardthat I had had him at a disadvantage of my own makingThere was little time wasted in the preliminaries When Falconnet saw ushe dropped his seconds arm and began to make ready I gave my sword toJennifer and the seconds went apart together There was some measuringand balancing of weapons and then Richard came backThe baronets sword is a good inch longer than yours in the blade andis somewhat heavier Tybee has brought a pair of French shortswordswhich he offers Will you change your termsNo I am content to fight with my own weaponJennifer nodded So I told him And then There was no surgeon to behad in town Dr Carew having gone with the Minute Men to join MrRutherford Tybee says tis scarce in accordance with the later rulingsto fight without oneTo the devil with their hairsplittings said I Let us have done withthem and be at itFalconnet was removing his coat and I stripped mine The seconds chosethe ground where the turf was short and firm and yet yielding enough togive good footing We faced each other my antagonist baring an armwhich despite the bejeweled hand was to the full as bigmuscled as myown My glance went from his weapon a rather heavy German bladestraight and slenderpointed to his face He was smiling as one whostrives to make the outer man a mask to cover all emotion and theplasters on his cheek drew the smile into a grimace that was all butdevilishThe seconds fell back but when Jennifer would have given the signal Istopped himOne moment if you please Sir Francis Falconnet you know meThe thinlidded eyes were veiled for an instant and then he liedsmoothlyYour pardon Captain Ireton I have not that honorTis a small matter but you do lie this morning as basely as you liedto Richard Coverdale nine years agone said I and then I signedJennifer to give the wordAttention gentlemen On guardMy enemys sword leaped to meet mine and at the same instant I heardanother click of steel betokening that the seconds had fallen to in abit of byplay between themselves as was then the fashion After that Iheard nothing for a time save the sibilant whisperings of the Ferara andthe German longsword and saw nothing save the fierce eyes glaring atme out of the midst of the plastermarred smileRecreant though he was I must do my adversary the justice to say thathe was a skilful master of fence agile as a French dancer and withalwellbreathed and persevering Twice nay thrice before I found myadvantage he had pricked me lightly with that extra inch of slenderpoint But when I had fairly felt his wrist I knew that his heavierweapon would shortly prove his undoing knew that the quick parry andlightninglike thrust would presently lag a little and then I shouldhave himSomething of this prophecy of triumph he must have read in my eyes foron the instant he was up and at me like a madman and I had my work wellcut out to hold him at the blades length I was so holding him was inmy turn beginning to press him slowly when there came a drumming ofhoofbeats on the soft turf and then a womans cryI looked aside and to my dying day I shall swear that my antagonist didlikewise What I saw was Mistress Margery Stair riding down upon us at ahandgallop and I lowered my point as any gentleman wouldIn the very acttwas while Jennifer was clutching at her bridle reinto stay her from riding fair between usI felt the hotwire prick ofthe steel in my shoulder and knew that my enemy had run me through as IstoodOf what befell afterward I have but dim memories There were morehooftramplings and then I felt the dewy turf under my hands and softfingers tremblingly busy at my neckerchief Then I saw swimmingly asthrough a veil of mist a womans face just above my own and it wasfull of horror and I heard my enemy say Twas most unfortunate and Ido heartily regret it Mr Jennifer I saw not why he had lowered hispoint Can I say moreHow Richard Jennifer made answer to this lie I know not nor do I knowaught else save by hearsay of any further happening in that grassyglade beneath my fathers oaks For the big German blade was a shrewdbloodletter and I fell asleep what time my lady was trying to stanchwith her kerchief the ebbing tide of lifeIVWHICH MAY BE PASSED OVER LIGHTLYWhen I came back to some clearer sensing of things I found myself abedin a room which was strange and yet strangely familiar Barring a greatoaken clothespress in one corner a rareeshow of curious china on theshelves where the books should have been and the face of an armoredsoldier staring down at me from its frame over the chimney piece whereI should have looked to see my mothers portrait the room was acounterpart of my old bedchamber at Appleby Hundred There was even afaint odor of lavender in the bedlinen and the sense of smell whichhath ever a better memory than any other carried me swiftly back to myboyhood and to the remembrance that my mother had always kept a sprayor two of that sweet herb in her linen closetAt the bedside there was a clawfooted table which also had the look ofan old friend and on it a dainty porringer filled with cuttings offragrant sweetbriar This was some womanly conceit I said to myselfand then I laughed though the laugh set a pair of wolfs jaws at workon my shoulder For you must know that I had lived the full half of KingDavids span of threescore and ten years and more and what womanlysoftness had fallen to my lot had been well got and paid forI closed my eyes the better to remember what had befallen and when Iopened them again was fain to wonder if the moment of backreachingstood not for some longer time In the deep bay of the window was agreat chair of Indian wickerwork and I could have sworn it had but nowbeen empty Yet when I looked again a woman sat in itNow of a truth I had seen this womans face but twice and once it worea smile of teasing mockery and once was full of terror but I thought Ishould live long and suffer much before the winsome challenging beautyof it would let me be as I had been before I had looked upon itShe knew not that I was awake and slaking the thirst of my eyes upon thesweetness of her and so I saw her then as few ever saw her I thinkwith the womanly barriers of defense all down Tis a hard test and onethat makes a blank at rest of many a face beautiful enough in actionbut though this ladys face was to the full as changeful as any Aprilsky it was never less than triumphantly beautifulI had said her eyes were blue but now they were deep wells reflectingthe soft gray of the clouded sky beyond the windowpanes I had madesure that her lips lent themselves most readily to mocking smilesscornful of any wit less trenchant than her own but now these mockinglips were pensive and with the rounded cheek and chin gave her the lookof a sweet child wanting to be kissed I had said her hair was bright inthe sunlight and so indeed it was but lacking the sun it still heldthe dull luster of burnished copper in its masses and her simplecarefree dressing of it at a time when les grandes dames werefrizzing and powdering and adding art to art to mar the womans crown ofglory gave her yet more the look of a childLastly I had called her small and certainly her figure was girlishbeside those grenadier dames of Maria Theresas court to whom my oldfieldmarshal had once presented me But when she rose and went to standin the windowbay I marked this that not any duchess or margravine ofthem all had a more queenly bearing or with all their stays andfurbelows could match her supple grace and lissom figureWhat with the bloodlettings and the wound fever coupled with thesubtle witchery of her presence thus in my sick room it is little to bewondered at that a curious madness came over me or that I forgot forthe moment the loyalty due to my dear lad Could I have stood before herand reading but half consent in the deepwelled eyes have clipt her inmy arms and laid my lips to hers I would have run to pay the price inearth or heaven or hell I thought deeming the fierce joy of it wellworth any penaltyAt this I should have stirred I suppose for she came quickly andstood beside meYou have slept long and well Captain Ireton she said and in all thethrilling joy of her nearer presence I found space to mark that hervoice had in it that sweet quality of sympathy which is all womanlyThey say I am good only to fetch and carrymay I fetch you anythingI fear the madness of the moment must still have been upon me for Isaid Since you are here yourself dear lady I need naught elseAt a flash I had my whipping in a low dipped curtsy and a mocking smilelike that she had flung to FalconnetMerci mon Capitaine she said and for all my wincings under thesharp lash of her sarcasm I was moved to wonder how she had the Frenchof it And then she added Is it the custom for Her Apostolic Majestysofficers to come out of a deathswound only to pay pretty complimentsTwas no compliment I denied and indeed I meant it Then I askedwhere I was and to whom indebted though I had long since guessed theanswer to both questionsIn a trice the mocking mood was gone and she became my lady hostesssteeped to her fingertips in gracious dignityYou are at Appleby Hundred sir Twas here they fetched you becausethere was no other house so near and you were sorely hurt RichardJennifer and my black boy made a litter of the saddlecloths and withSir Francis and Mr Tybee to helpI think she must have seen that this thrust was sharper than that of theGerman longsword for she stopped in midsentence and looked away fromme And surely I thought it was the very irony of fate that I shouldthus be brought half dead to the house that was my fathers with myenemy and his second to share the burden of meBut your father I queried when the silence had grown overlongMy father is away at Queensborough so you must een trust yourself tomy tender mercies Captain Ireton Are you strong enough to have yourwound dressedShe asked but waited for no answer of mine Summoning a black boy tohold the basin of water she fell to upon the wounddressing with aslittle ado as if she had been a surgeons apprentice on a battlefieldand I a bloodless ancient too old to thrill at the touch of a womanshandsDear heart tis a monstrous ugly hurt she declared replacing thewrappings with deft fingers How came you to go about picking a quarrelwith Sir FrancisTwas not of my seeking I returned and then I could have cursed myfoolish tongueIs that generous Captain Ireton We hear something of the talk of thetown and that saysThat says I struck him without sufficient cause I am content to let itstand soNay but you should not be content Is there not strife enough in thisunhappy land without these causeless bickeringsHere was my lady turned preacher all in a breath and I with no words toanswer her But I could not let it go thusI knew Sir Francis Falconnet in England said I hoping by this toturn her safe asideAh then there was a cause Tell it meNay that I may notThough she was hurting me sorely in the wounddressing and knew it shelaughedTis most ungallant to deny a lady sir But I shall know without thetelling twas about a woman Tell me Captain Ireton is she fairSeeing that her mood had changed again I tried to give her quip forjest but what with the pain of the swordthrust and the sweet agony ofher touches I could only set my teeth against a groan She went ondrawing the bandagings little heedful how she racked me I thought andyet when all was done she stood beside me all of a tremble as anytenderhearted woman mightThere she said tis over for a time and I make no doubt you areglad enough Now you have nothing to do save to lie quiet till ithealsAnd how long will that be think youWe shall see a long time I hope You shall be punished properly foryour hot temper I promise you Captain IretonWith that she left me and went to stand in the windowbay and fromlying mousestill and watching her oversteadily I fell asleep againWhen I awoke the day was in its gloaming and she was goneAfter this I saw her no more for six full circlings of the clockhandsand grew fair famished for a sight of her sweet face But to atone sheor some messenger of Richard Jennifers brought me my faithful Dariusand he it was who fetched me my food and drink and dressed my woundFrom him I gleaned that the master of Appleby Hundred had returned fromQueensborough and that there were officers in red coats continuallygoing back and forth always with a hearty welcome from Gilbert StairNow though the master of my stolen heritage had little cause to loveme I thought he had still less to fear me so it seemed passing strangethat he came not once to my bedchamber to pass the time of day with hisunbidden guest or to ask how he fared But in this as in many otherthings I reckoned without my enemy though I might have known that SirFrancis would be oftenest among the redcoated officers coming andgoingBut stranger than this or than my ladys continued avoidance of me wasthe lack of a visit from Richard Jennifer Knowing well my dear ladsloyalty to the patriot cause I could only conjecture that he hadfinally broken Margerys enforced truce to go and join Mr Rutherfordsmilitia which as Darius told me was rallying to attack a Torystronghold at Ramsours MillWith this surmise I was striving to content myself on that evening ofthe third day when Mistress Margery burst in upon me brighteyed andwith her cheeks aflameCaptain Ireton I will know the true cause of this quarrel whichfailing in yourself you pass on to Richard Jennifer she cried Wasit not enough that you should get yourself half slain without sendingthis headstrong boy to his deathNow in all my surmisings I had not thought of this and truly if she hadsought far and wide for a whip to scourge me with she could have foundno thong to cut so deepGod help me I groaned Has this fiend incarnate killed my poor ladNo he is not dead she confessed relenting a little But he has thebaronets bullet through his swordarm for the sake of your overseasdisagreement with Sir FrancisI could not tell her that though my quarrel with this villain was butthe avenging of poor Dick Coverdales wrongs Richard Jennifers was forthe baronets affront to her So I bore the blame in silence gladenough to be assured that my dear lad was only woundedWhy dont you speak sir she snapped flying out at me in a passionfor my lack of wordsWhat should I say I have not forgot that once you called meungenerousYou should defend yourself if you can And you should ask my pardonfor calling my fathers guest hard namesThe last I will do right heartily Twas but the simple truth but itwas illspoken in your presence Mistress StairAt this she laughed merrily and in all my worldwanderings I had neverheard a sound so gladsome as this sweet laugh of hers when she would beon the forgiving handSurely any one would know you are a soldier Captain Ireton No othercould make an apology and renew the offense so innocently in the samebreath Then her mood changed again in the dropping of an eyelid andshe sighed and said Poor DickAs ever when she was with me my eyes were devouring her and at thesigh and the trembling of the sweet lips in sympathy I found thatcurious lovemadness coming upon me again Then I saw that I muststraightway dig some chasm impassable between this woman and me as Ishould hope to be loyal to my friend So I said He loves you wellMistress MargeryShe glanced up quickly with a smile which might have been mocking orloving I could not tell which it wasDid he make you his deputy to tell me so Captain IretonNow I might have known that she was only luring me on to some pitfall ofmockery but I did not and must needs burst out in some clumsydisclaimer meant to shield my dear lad And in the midst of it shelaughed againOh you do amuse me mightily mon Capitaine she cried I doprotest I shall come to see you oftener Tis as good as any playSaw you ever a play in this backwoods wilderness I asked glad of anyexcuse to change the talk and keep her by meNo indeed But you are not to think that no one has seen the greatworld save only yourself Captain Ireton What would you say if I shouldtell you that I too have seen your London and even your ParisHere I must blunder again and say that I had been wondering how else shecame by the Parisian French but at this her jesting mood vanishedsuddenly and she spoke softlyI had it of my mother who came of the Huguenots She spoke it alwaysto me But my father speaks it not and now I am losing it for want ofpracticeHow is it that love transforms the once contemptible into a thing mosthighly to be prized My eight years of campaigning on the Continent hadgiven me the French speech or so much of it as the clumsy tongue of mecould master and I had always held it in hearty English scorn Yet nowI was eager enough to speak it with her and to take as my very own thelittle cry of joy wherewith she welcomed my hesitant mouthing of itFrom that we fell to talking in her mothers tongue of the hardships ofthose same Huguenot migrs and when I looked not at her I couldspeak in terms dispassionate and cool of this or aught else and when Ilooked upon her my heart beat faster and my blood leaped quickly and Iknew not always what it was I saidAfter a timetwas when Darius fetched me my supper and thecandlesshe went away and so ended a day which saw the beginning of astruggle fiercer than any the turbaned Turk had ever given me For whenI had eaten and was alone with time to think I knew well that I lovedthis woman and should always love her this in spite of honor orloyalty to Richard Jennifer or any other thing in heaven or earthVHOW I LOST WHAT I HAD NEVER GAINEDThough I dared not hope she would keep her promise and was sometimes sosorely beset as to tremble at her coming Margery looked in upon meoftener and soon there grew up between us a comradeship the like ofwhich I think had never been between a woman loved and a man wholoving her was yet constrained to play the part of her true loversfriendIf I played this part but stumblingly if at times the madness of mypassion would not be denied the look or word or handclasp not of poorcool friendship I have this to comfort me that in after time when mydear lad came to know he forgave me freelynay held me altogetherblameless as I was notOf what these looks and words and handclasps meant to Margery I had nohint But in my hours of sanity when I would pass these slippings inreview I could recall no answering flash of hers to salt the woundingsof the consciencewhip So far from it it seemed as this sweetcomradeship budded and blossomed on the stock of a better acquaintanceshe came to hold me more as if I were some cross between a father or anelder brother and some closer confidant of her own sexYou are not to understand that she was always thus nor overoften Morefrequently that side of her which I soon came to call the mothers wasturned to me and I was made to stand a target for her wit and railleryBut she was ever changeful as a child and in the midst of some lightjesting mood would sober instantly and give my age its dueIn some of these her soberer times I felt her lean upon me as mysister might had I had one at others she would frankly set me in herfathers place declaring I must tell her what to say or do in this orthat entanglement Again and this came oftener as our friendship grewshe would talk to me as surely woman never talked to any but a kinsmantelling me navely of her conquests and sparing no gallant of them allsave only Richard JenniferAnd of Dick and his devotion she spoke now and then as well thoughnever mockingly as of the others Nay once when I pressed her on thispoint asking her plainly if my dear lad had not good cause to hope shewould only smile and turn her face away and say that of all the men sheknew the hopeful ones pleased her best So I was thus assured that if itwere a scale for love to tip my ladys heart would fall to RichardNow I took this to be a hopeful sign that she would tell me freely ofthese her little heart affairs and seeing her so safe upon the side offriendship held the looser rein upon my own unchartered passion Solong as I could keep my love well masked and hidden what harm could cometo her or any if I should give it leave to live in prison None Ithought and yet at times was made a very coward by the thought Forlove like other living things will grow by what it feeds upon andonce fullgrown may haply come to laugh at bonds however strong orcunningly devisedWith such a fever in my veins it was little wonder that my wound healedslowly As time passed by with never a word of news from the worldwithoutif Margery knew aught of the fighting she would never lisp asyllable to meand with Gilbert Stair still keeping churlishly beyondthe sight or sound of me I fretted sorely and would be goneYet this was but a passing mood When Margery was with me I was notillcontent to eat the bread of sufferance in her fathers house andangry pride had scanty footing But when she was away this same pridetook sharp revenges getting me out of bed to bully Darius into dressingme that I might foot it up and down the room while I was still unfit forany useful thingOne morning in the summer third of June my lady came early and surprisedme at this business of pacing back and forth Whereat she scolded me aswas her wont when I grew restiveWhat weighty thing have you to do that you should be so fierce to beabout it Monsieur Impetuous she cried Fi donc youd try thepatience of a saintWhich you are not I ventured But truly Margery I am growingstronger now and the bed does irk me desperately if you must knowBesidesWell what is there else besides Do I not pamper you enoughI laughed Ill say whatever you would have me sayso it be not thetruthIll have you say nothing until you sit downShe pushed the great chair of Indian wickerwork into place before thewindowbay and when I was at rest she drew up a low hassock and sat atmy feetNow you may go on she saidYou have not told me what you would have me sayThe truth she commandedWhat is truth said jesting Pilate I quoted Why do you supposemy Lord Bacon thought the Roman procurator jested at such a time andplaceYou are quibbling Monsieur John I want to know why you are soimpatient to be goneSaw you ever a man worthy the name who could be content to bideinactive when duty callsThat is not the whole truth she said half absently You think youare unwelcome hereTwas you said that not I But I must needs know your father will berelieved when he is safely quit of meTwas you said that not I Monsieur John she retorted giving meback my own words Has ever word been brought you that he would speedyour partingSurely not since I am still here But you must know that I have neverseen his face as yetAnd is that strange You must not forget that he is Gilbert Stair andyou are Roger Iretons sonI am not likely to forget it But still a word of welcome to theunbidden guest would not have come amiss And it was none of myseekingthis asylum in his houseTrue but that has naught to do with any coolness of my fathersWhat is it thenbesides the fact that I am Roger Iretons sonI think twas what you said to Mr PengarvinThat little smirking wretch What has he to say or do in thisShe looked away from me and said He is my fathers factor and man ofaffairsAh I have always to be craving your pardon Margery But I said naughtto this parchmentfacedto this Mr Pengarvin that might offend yourfather or anyHow then will you explain this that you swore to drive my fatherfrom Appleby Hundred as soon as ever you had raised a following amongthe rebelsTis easily explained this thriceaccursedoh pardon me again Ipray you I will not name him any name at all What I meant to say wasthat he lied I made no threats to him to tell the plain truth I wastoo fiercely mad to bandy words with himWhat made you mad Monsieur JohnTwas his threat to meto taint me with my fathers outlawry Do yougreatly blame me MargeryNoThereat a silence came and sat between us and I fell to loving her themore because of it but when she spoke I always loved her more forspeakingMy father has had little peace since coming here she said at lengthHe is old and none too well and as for king and Congress asks nothingbut his right to hold aloof And this they will not give himRemembering what Jennifer had told me of Gilbert Stairs trimming Ismiled withinThat is the way of all the world in wartime ma petite A partizanmay suffer once for all but both sides hold a neutral lawful preyTwas as the spark to tinder my word the spark and in her eyes theanswering flashI tell him so she cried I tell him always that the king will havehis own again But still he halts and hesitates and when these rebelscome and quarter on usI fear she must have seen my inward smile this time for she broke offin the midst and I made haste to forestall her flying out at meOh come my dear you should not be so fierce with him when youyourself have brought a rebel to his house to nurse aliveShe looked me fairly in the eye You should be the last to remind me ofmy treason Monsieur JohnThen you are free to call it treason are you Margery I saidShe looked away from me again How can it well be less than treasonThen suddenly she turned and clasped her hands upon my knee You mustnot be too hard upon me Monsieur John Ive tried to do my duty as Isaw it and I have asked no questions And yet I know much more than youhave told meWhat do you knowI know your wound has been your safety If you should leave this roomand house today you would never wear the buff and blue again CaptainIretonYou mean they would hang me for a spy Will you believe me Margery ifI say I have not yet worn the buff and blue at allOh The little exclamation was of pure delight Then they were allmistaken You are no rebel after allWas ever man so tempted since the fall of Adam As I have writ it downfor you in measured words I was no more than half a patriot at thistime And love has made more traitors than its opposites of lust orgreed In no uncertain sense I was a man without a country and thisfair maiden on the hassock at my feet was all the world to me I saw inbriefer time than any clock hands ever measured how much a yielding wordmight do for me and then I thought of Richard Jennifer and was myselfagainNay little one I said there has been no mistake For their ownpurposes my enemies have passed the word that I am here as the Baron deKalbs paid spy That is no mistake tis a lie cut out of whole clothI came here straight from New Berne and back of that from London andthe Continent and scarcely know the buff and blue by sight But I amCarolina born dear lady and this King Georges governor hanged myfather So when God gives me strength to mount and rideNow who is fierce she cried And then like lightning Will youraise a band of rebels and come and take your own againYou know I will not I protested so gravely that she laughed againthough now there were tears from what wellspring of emotion I knewnot in her eyesOh mercy me Have you never one little grain of imagination MonsieurJohn You are too monstrous literal for our poor jesting age Then shesobered quickly and added this And yet I fear that this is what myfather fearsI did not tell her that he might have feared it once with reason orthat now the houseless dog she petted should have life of me though mineenemy should sick him on But I did say her father had no present causeto dread meHe thinks he has And surely there is cause enough she addedI smiled and loving her the more for her fairness must smile againNay you have changed all that dear lady Truly I did at first flyout at him and all concerned for what has made me a poor pensioner in myfathers houseor rather in the house that was my fathers But thatwas while the hurt was new I have been a soldier of fortune too long tothink overmuch of the loss of Appleby Hundred Twas my fatherscertainly but twas never mineAnd yetand yet it should be yours John Ireton She said it bravelywith uplifted face and eloquent eyes that one who ran might readTis good and true of you to say so little one but there be two sidesto that as well So my fathers acres come at last to you and RichardJennifer I shall be well content I do assure you MargeryShe sprang up from her low seat and went to stand in the windowbayAfter a time she turned and faced me once again and the warm blood wasin cheek and neck and there was a soft light in her eyes to make themshine like starsThen you would have me marry Richard Jennifer she askedTwas but a little word that honor bade me say and yet it choked me andI could not say itDick would have you Margery and Dick is my dear friendas I am hisBut you she queried Were you my friend as well is this as youwould have itMy look went past her through the leadrimmed windowpanes to the greatoaks and hickories on the lawn to these and to the white road windingin and out among them While yet I sought for words in which to give herunreservedly to my dear lad two horsemen trotted into view One of themwas a kings man the other a civilian in sober black The redcoat rodeas English troopers do with a firm seat as if the man were master ofhis mount but the smaller man in black seemed little to the mannerborn and daylight shuttled in and out beneath him keeping time to thejogtrot of his beastI thought it passing strange that with all good will to answer herthese coming horsemen seemed to hold me silent And indeed I did notspeak until they came so near that I could make them outI am your friend Margery mine as good a friend as you will let me beAnd as between Richard Jennifer and another I should be a sorry friendto Dick did I notShe heard the clink of horseshoes on the gravel and turned signing tome for silence while she looked below The window overhung the entranceon that side and through the opened aircasement I heard somebabblement of voices though not the wordsI must go down she said Tis company come and my father is awayShe passed behind my chair and hearing her hand upon the latch I hadthought her gonegone down to welcome my enemy and his riding mate thefactor But while I was cursing my unready tongue and repenting that Ihad not given her some small word of warning she spoke againYou say Richard Jennifer or another What know you of any otherMonsieur JohnNay I know nothing save what you have told me and from that I havebeen hoping there was no otherBut if I say there may beMy heart went sick at that True I had thought to give her generouslyto Dick whose right was paramount but to anotherMargery come hither where I may see you And when she stood before melike a bidden child Tell me little comrade who is that otherBut now her mood was changed again and from standing sweet and pensiveshe fell alaughingWhat impudence she cried Ma foi You should borrow PreMatthieus cassock and breviary then mayhap I might confess to youBut not beforeBut still I pressed herTell me MargeryShe tossed her head and would not look at me Dick Jennifer is but aboy suppose this other were a man fullgrownYesAnd a soldierThe sickness in my heart became a fireO Margery Dont tell me it is this fiend who came just nowAll in a flash the jesting mood was gone but that which took its placewas strange to me Tears came her bosom heaved And then she would havepassed me but I caught her hands and held them fastMargery one moment for your own sweet sake if not for Dicks ormine have naught to do with this devils emissary of a man If you onlyknewif I dared tell youBut for once it seemed I had stretched my privilege beyond the limitShe whipped her hands from my hold and faced me coldlySir Francis says you are a brave gentleman Captain Ireton and thoughhe knows well what you would be about he has not sent a file of men toput you in arrest And in return you call him names behind his back Ishall not stay to listen sirWith that she passed again behind my chair and once again I heard herhand upon the latch But I would say my sayForgive me Margery I pray you twas only what you said that made memad Tis less than naught if youll deny itI waited long and patiently and thought she must have gone before heranswer came And this is what she saidIf I must tell you thentis now two weeks and more since Sir FrancisFalconnet asked me to marry him II hope you do feel better CaptainIretonAnd with these bitterest of all words to her leavetaking she left meto endure as best I might the hell of torment they had lighted for meVISHOWING HOW RED WRATH MAY HEAL A WOUNDIt was full two days after the coming of the baronet and thefactorlawyer Pengarvin before I saw my ladys face nearhand again andsometimes I was glad for Richard Jennifers sake but oftener wouldcurse and swear because I was bound hand and foot and could not balk myenemyI knew Sir Francis and the lawyer still lingered on at ApplebyHundredindeed I saw them daily from my windowand Darius would betelling me that they waited upon the coming of some courier from thesouth But this I disbelieved Some suchlike lie the baronet might havetold I thought but when I saw him walk abroad with Margery on his armpacing back and forth beneath the oaks and bending low to catch herlightest word with grave and courtly deference that none knew better howto feign I knew wherefore he stayedknew and raged afresh at my ownimpotence and for the thought that Margery was wholly at the mercy ofthis devilYours is a colder century than was ours my dears Your art has temperedlove and passion into sentiment and hate you have learned to callaversion or dislike But we of that simplehearted elder time were moredownright and I have writ the word I mean in saying that my love was atthe mercy of this fiendI know not how it is or why but there are men who have this giftsomewinning way to turn a womans head or touch her heart and I knew wellthis gift was his Twas not his face for that was something less thanhandsome to my fancy nor yet his figure though that was big andsoldierly enough It was rather in some subtlety of manner some powerof simulation whereby in any womanly heart he seemed to stand at willfor that which he was notAs I have said I knew him well enough knew him incapable of love apartfrom passion and that to him there was no sacredness in maiden chastityor wifely vows So he but gained his end he cared no whit what followedafter ruin broken hearts lost souls a man slain now and then to keepthe scale from tippingall were as one to him or to the FrancisFalconnet I knewAnd touching marriage with Margery or any other I feared that lovewould have no word to say Passion there might be and that fiercedesire to have and wear which burns like any misers fever in the bloodbut never love as lovers measure it Why then had he proposed toMargery The answer did not tarry Since he was now but a gentlemanvolunteer it was plain that he had squandered his estate and so mightbrook the marriage chain if it were linked up with my fathers acresIt was a bait to lure such a gamester strongly As matters stood with usin that wan summer of exhaustion and defeat the kings cause waxed andgrew more hopeful day by day And in event of final victory a landlessbaronet marrying Margerys dower of Appleby Hundred might snap hisfingers at the Jews who haply had driven him forth from EnglandAnd as for Margery Truly she had told me or as good as told me thather maiden love had pledged itself a pawn for Jennifers redeeming Butthere be other things than love to sway a womans will This volunteercaptain with the winning way was of the haute noblesse and he couldmake her Lady Falconnet Moreover he was with her day by day and youmay mark this as you will that a present suitor hath ever the trumpcards to play against the absent loverSo brooding over this I wore out two most dismal daysthe first inmany I had had to pass alone But on the morning of the third the skywas lightened though then the light was but a flash and darknessfollowed quickly after She came again and brought me a visitor it wasthis same Father Matthieu with whom she had jestingly compared me andlest I should take my punishment too lightly stayed but to make thegood priest known to meNow I was born and bred an heretic by any papists reckoning but Ihave ever held it witless in that man who lets a creed obstruct afriendship Moreover this sweetfaced cleric was the friendliest ofmen friendly and yet the wiliest Jesuit of them all since he read meat a glance and fell straightway to praising MargeryA truly sweet young demoiselle he said by way of foreword no soonerwas the door closed behind her and while he preached a sermon on thistext I grew to know and love himHe was a little man as bone and muscle go with deepset eyes andfeatures kind and mild and fine as any womans some such face asLeonardo gave St John could that have been less youthful I could nottell his order though from his wellworn cassock girded at the waistwith a frayed bit of hempen cord he might have been a Little Brother ofthe Poor But this I noted that he was not tonsured and his whitehair soft and fine as Margerys was like an aureole to the finelychiseled features As missionary men of any creed are apt he looked farolder than he really was and when he came to tell me of his life amongthe Indians it was patent how the years had multiplied upon himI listened well enough content to learn him better by his own reportBut you must find it thankless work this gospeling in the wildernessI ventured when all was said Tis but a hermits life for any man ofparts and after all when you have done your utmost your converts arebut savages as they wereAt this he smiled and shook his head Non Monsieur not so You area soldier and can not see beyond your point of sword Mais mon amithey have souls to save these poor children of the forest and they arefar more sinned against than sinning I find them kind and true andfaithful and some of them are noble in their wayI laughed Ive read about those noble ones I said Twas in a bookcalled Hakluyts Voyages Truly I know them not as you do for in myyouth I knew them most in war We called them brave but cruel then andwhen I was a boy I could have shown you where within a mile of thisthey burned poor Davie Davidson at the stakeAh yes there has been much of that he sighed But you mustconfess Captain Ireton that you English carry fire and sword amongthem tooFrom that he would have told me more about the savages but I wasinterested nearer home As I have said I was like any prisoner in adungeon for lack of news and so by degrees I fetched him round totelling me of what was going on beyond my windowsight of lawn andforestBrave deeds were to the fore it seemed At Ramsours Mill a few milesnorth and west some little handful of determined patriots had bestedthrice their number of the kings partizans and that without a leaderbigger than a county colonel Lord Rawdon in command of LordCornwalliss van had come as far as Waxhaw Creek but beingunsupported had withdrawn to Hanging Rock Our Mr Rutherford was onhis way to the Forks of Yadkin to engage the Tories gathering underColonel Bryan As yet it seemed we had no force of any consequence totake the field against Cornwallis though there were flying rumors of anarmy marching from Virginia with a newappointed general at its headOn the whole it was the kings cause that prospered and the rising waveof invasion bade fair to inundate the land So thought my kindly gossipand having naught to gain or lose in the great war or rather havingnaught to lose and everything to gain whichever way these worldly cardsmight run he was a fair impartial witnessAs you may well suppose this news awoke in me the lust of battle and Imust chafe the more for having it And while my visitor talked on and Iwas listening with the outward ear my brain was busy putting two andtwo together How came it that the British outpost still remained atQueensborough with my Lord Rawdon withdrawn and the patriot home guardwell down upon its rear Some urgent reason for the stay there must beand at that I remembered what Darius had told me of its captainswaiting for some messenger from the southI scored this matter with a question mark putting it aside to think onmore when I should be alone And when the priest had told me all thenews at large we came again to speak of MargeryI go and come through all this borderland he said when I had askedhim how and why he came to Appleby Hundred but it was mamsellesmessage brought me here She is my one ewe lamb in all this region andI would journey far to see herI wondered pointedly at this for in that day the West was fiercelyProtestant and the Mother Church had scanty footing in the borderlandBut Mistress Margery is not a Catholic said IHis look forgave the protest in the wordsIndeed she is my son Has she not told youNow truly she had not told me so in any measured word or phrase and yetI might have guessed it since she had often spoken lovingly of thissame Father Matthieu And yet it was incredible to meBut howI do not understand how that can be I stammered Surelyshe told me she was of Huguenot blood on the mothers side and thatisThe missionarys smile was lenient still but full of meaningNot all who wander from the Catholic fold are lost forever CaptainIreton The mother of this demoiselle lived all her life a Protestant Ithink but when she came to die she sent for me And that is how herchild was sent to France and grew up conventbred Monsieur Stair gavehis promise at the mothers deathbed and though he liked it not hekept itAha I see And for this single lamb of your scant fold you brave theterrors of our heretic backwoods It does you credit Father MatthieuThe war fills all horizons now mayhap but I have seen the time inMecklenburg when your cassock would have been a challenge to the mobHis smile was quite devoid of bitterness The time has not yet passedhe said gently I have been six weeks on the way from Maryland hitherhiding in the forest by day and faring on at night Indeed I was inhiding on a neighboring plantation when our demoiselles messenger foundmeThis put me keen upon remembering what had gone before how he had saidat first that she had sent for him I thought it strange knowing howperilous the time and place must be for such as he But not until herose and bidding me good day left me to myself did I so much as guessthe thing his coming meant When I had guessed it when I put this tothather telling me Sir Francis had proposed for her and this hersending for the priestthe madness of my love for her was as naughtcompared to that anger which seized and racked meI know not how the hours of this black day were made to come and gogrinding me to dust and ashes in their passage yet leaving me alive andkeen to suffer at the endA thousand times that day I lived in torment through the scene in whichthe priest had doubtless come to play his part of joiner The stage forit would be the great room fronting south the room my father used tocall our castle hall For guests I thought there would be space enoughand some to spare for as you know our Mecklenburg was patriot to thecore But as to this the bridegrooms troopers might fill out the taleand in my heated fancy I could see them grouped beneath thecandlesconces with belts and baldrics fresh pipeclayed and shakosdoffed and sabretaches well in front A man fullgrowna soldiershe had said and trooperguests were fitting in such caseFrom serving in a Catholic land I knew the customs of the Mother ChurchSo I could see the priest in cassock alb and stole as he would standbefore some makeshift altar lit with candles And as he stands they cometo kneel before him my winsome Margery in all her royal beauty a childto love and yet an empress peerless in her womans realm and at herside with his knee touching hers this man who was a devilWhat wonder if I cursed and choked and cursed again when the maddeningthought of what all this should mean for my poor wounded Richardandlater on for Margery herselfpossessed me In which of these hotfevergusts of rage the thought of interference came I know not Butthat it came at lengtha thought and plan fullgrown at birthI doknowThe pointing of the plan was desperate and simple It was neither morenor less than this I knew the house and every turn and passage in itand when the hour should strike I said I should go down and skulk amongthe guests and at the crucial moment find or seize a weapon and flingmyself upon this bridegroom as he should kneel before the altarWith strength to bend him back and strike one blow I saw not why itmight not win And as for strength I have learned this in war that sothe rage be hot enough twill nerve a dying man to hack and hew and stabas with the strength of tenAlthough it was most terribly overlong in coming the end of that blackday did come at last and with it Darius to fetch my supper and thecandles You may be sure I questioned him and if you know the blacksyoull smile and say I had my labor for my painsthe which I had Hisplace was at the quarters and of what went on within the house he knewno more than I But this he told me that company surely was expectedand that some air of mystery was abroadWhen he was gone I ate a soldiers portion knowing of old how ill athing it is to take an empty stomach into battle For the same cause Idrank a second cup of winetwas old madeira of my fatherslayinginand would have drunk a third but that the bottle would notyield itIt was fully dark when I had finished and thinking ever on my planwould strive afresh to weld its weakest link This was the hazard of theweapongetting With fullblood health and strength I might have gonebarehanded but as it was I feared to take the chance So with acandle I went aprowling in the deep drawers of the old oakenclothespress and in the escritoire which once had been my mothers andfound no weapon bigger than a hairpinIt was no great disappointment for I had looked before with daylight inthe room Besides the wine was mounting and when the search was donethe hazard seemed the less So I could rush upon him unawares and put myknee against his back I thought the Lord of Battles would give mestrength to break his neck across itAt that I capped the candles and taking post in the deep bay of thewindow set myself to watch for the lighting of the great room at thefront This had two windows on my side and while I could not see themI knew that I should see the sheen of light upon the lawnThe night was clear but moonless and the thickleafed masses of theoaks and hickories rose a wall of black to curtain half the hemisphereof starry sky As always in our forest land the hour was shrilly vocalthough to me the chirping din of frogs and insects hath ever stood forsilence Somewhere beyond the thicketwall an owl was callingmournfully and I bethought me of that superstitionold as man foraught I knowof how the hooting of an owl betokens death And then Ilaughed for surely death would come to one or more of those beneath myfathers roof within the compass of the nightBehind the closedrawn curtain though I could see it not the virginforest darkened all the land and from afar within its secret depths Iheard or thought I heard the dismal howling of the timber wolvesBelow the house was silent as the grave and this seemed strange to meFor in the time of my youth a wedding was a joyous thing Yet I wouldremember that these present times were perilous and also that mybridegroom captained but a little band of troopers in a land but nowbecome fiercely debatableIt must have been an hour or more before the sound of distancemuffledhoofbeats on the road broke in upon the chirping silence of the night Ilooked and listened straining eye and ear hearing but little andseeing less until three shadowy horsemen issued from the curtainwall ofblack beneath my windowIt was plain that others watched as well as I for at their coming asheen of light burst from the opened door below at which there wereswordclankings as of armed men dismounting and then a few lowvoicedwords of welcome Followed quickly the closing of the door and silenceand when my eyes grew once again accustomed to the gloom I saw belowthe horses standing head to head and in the midst a man to hold themSo I thought but three in all and one of them a servant Twill bea scantly guested wedding And then I raged within again to think ofhow my love should be thus dishonored in a corner when she should havethe world to clap its hands and praise her beautyAt that and while I looked the lawn was banded farther on by twobroad beams of light and then I knew my time was comeFeeling my way across the darkened chamber I softly tried thedoorlatch It yielded at the touch but not the door I pulled andbraced myself and pulled again Twas but a waste of strength The doorwas fast with that contrivance wherewith my father used to bar me inwhat time I was a boy and would go raccooning with our negro hunters Myenemy was no fool He had been shrewd enough to lock me in against thechance of interruptionI wish you might conceive the helpless horror grappling with me therebehind that fastened door but this indeed you may not having felt itnot For one dazed moment I was sick as death with fear and frenzy and Iknow not what besides and all the blackness of the night swam suddenred before my eyes Then in the twinkling of an eye the madness leftme cool and sane as if the fit had been the travailpain of some newbirth of soul And after that as I remember I knew not rage nor hastenor weaknessknew no other thing save this that I had set myself atask to do and I would do itMy window was in shape like half a cell of honeycomb and close besideit on the outer wall there grew an ancient ivyvine which more than oncehad held my weight when I was younger and would evade my fathersvigilanceI swung the casement noiselessly and clambered out with hand and footin proper hold as if those youthful flittings of my boyhood days hadbeen but yesternight A breathless minute later I was down and afoot onsolid ground and then a thing chanced which I would had not The manwhom I had called a servant turned and saw meHalt Who goes there he criedA friend said I between my wishings for a weapon For this servantof my prefigurings proved to be a trooper booted spurred and armedBy God I think you lie he said and after that he said no more forhe was down among the horses hoofs and I upon him kneeling hard toscant his breath for shoutingsIt grieves me now through all these years to think that I did kneel toohard upon this man He was no enemy of mine and did but door seek todohis duty But he would fight or die and I must fight or die and soit ended as such strivings will with some grim crackling of ribsandwhen I rose he rose not with meWith all the fierce excitement of the struggle yet upon me I stayed toknot the bridle reins upon his arm to make it plain that he had fallenat his post That done I took his sword as surer for my purpose than apistol and hugging the deepest shadow of the wall approached thenearer window It was open wide for the night was sultry warm and fromwithin there came the clink of glass and now a toast and now a troopersoathI drew myself by inches to the casement which was high finding somefoothold in the wall and when I looked within I saw no wedding guestsno priest no altar only this a table in the midst with bottles on itand round it five men lounging at their ease and drinking to the kingOf these five two the baronet and the lawyer were known to me and Ihave made them known to you A third I guessed for Gilbert Stair Theother two were strangersVIIIN WHICH MY LADY HATH NO PARTSeeing that I had taken a mans life for this the chance of looking inupon a drinking bout you will not wonder that I went aghast and wouldhave fled for very shame had not a sudden weakness seized me But in themidst I heard a mention of my name and so had leave I thought to stayand listenIt was one of the latecomers who gave me this leave a man well on inyears grizzled and weatherbeaten a seasoned soldier by his look andgarb Though his frayed shoulderknot was only that of a captain offoottwas plain enough he ranked his comrade and the knight as wellYou say youve bagged this Captain Ireton Who may he be Surely notold Rogers sonThe same said the baronet shortly and would be filling his glassagain He could always drink more and feel it less than any sot I everknewBut how the devil came he here The last I knew of himtwas somehalfscore years ago though come to thinkhe was a lieutenant in theRoyal ScotsMine enemy nodded So he was But afterward he cut the service andlevanted to the ContinentThe questioner fell into a muse then he laughed and clapped his legEcod I do remember now There was a damned good messroom joke abouthim When he was in the Blues they used to say his solemn face wouldstop a merrymaking Well after he had been in Austria a while theytold this on him that his fieldmarshal had him listed for a majorityand so he was presented to the empress But when Maria Theresa saw himshe shrieked and cried out Il est le pre aux ttes rondes luimmeLe portezvous dehors So he got but a captaincy after all ha hahaNow this was but a messroom gibe as he had said cut out of unmarredcloth at that Our Austrian Maria ever had a better word thanroundhead for her soldiers But yet it stung and stung the morebecause I had and have the Ireton face and that is unbeloved of womenand glum and curst and solemn even when the man behind it would bekindly So when they laughed and chuckled at this jest I lingered onand listened with the better graceWhat brought him overseas Sir Francis Twas not the grizzled jesterwho asked but the younger officer his comradeFalconnet smiled as one who knows a thing and will not tell and turnedto Gilbert StairWhat was it think you Mr Stair he said passing the question onAt this they all looked to the master of Appleby Hundred and I lookedtoo He was not the man I should have hit upon in any throng as thereaver of my fathers estate still less the man who might be Margerysfather He had the face of all the Stairs of Ballantrae without itssimple Scottish ruggedness a sort of weasel face it was with palegrayeyes that had a trick of shifty dodging and deepfurrowed about themouth and chin with lines that spoke of indecision It was not of himthat Margery got her firm round chin or her steadfast eyes that knewnot how to quail nor aught of anything she owed a father save only herpaternity youd say And when he spoke the thin falsetto voice matchedthe weak chin to a hairI Damme Sir Francis I know not why he camehow should I know hequavered Appleby Hundred is minemine I tell you His title was wellhanged on a tree with his damned rebel fatherA laugh uproarious from the three soldiers greeted his petulantoutburst after which the baronet enlightened the othersAs you know Captain John Appleby Hundred once belonged to the rebelRoger Ireton and Mr Stair here holds but a confiscators title Tislikely the son heard of the war and thought he stood some chance to comeinto his own againOh aye sure enough quoth the elder officer tilting his bottleafresh And then Of course he promptly listed with the rebels when hecame Trust Roger Iretons son for thatMy baronet wagged his head assentingly to this then clinched the lie inwordsOf course we have his commission He is on De Kalbs staff detachedfor special dutyA spy roared the jester And yet you havent hanged himSir Francis shrugged like any Frenchman All in good time my dearCaptain There were reasons why I did not care to knot the rope myselfBesides we had a little disagreement years agone across the watertwas about a womanoh she was no mistress of his I do assureyouthis to quench my jesters laugh incredulous He was keen uponme for satisfaction in this old quarrel and I gave it him thinkinghed hang the easier for a little blooding firstHere the factorlawyer cut in anxiously But you will hang him SirFrancis Youve promised that you knowI did not hate my enemy the more because he turned a shoulder to thislittle bloodhound and quite ignored the interruptionSo we fought it out one morning in Mr Stairs woodfield and he hadwhat he came for Not to give him a chance to escape we brought himhere and as soon as he is fit to ride Ill send him to the colonelTarleton will give him a short shrift I promise you and thenthisto the master of Appleby Hundredthen your title will be well quietedMr StairAt this the weatherbeaten captain roared again and smote the table tillthe bottles reeledI say Sir Frank thats gooddamned good So you have him crimpedhere in his own house stuffing him like a penned capon before you wringhis neck Ah ha ha But tis to be hoped you have his legs well tiedIf he be any son of my old madbull Roger Ireton youll hardly hang himpeacefully like a trussed fowl before the fireThe baronet smiled and said Ill be your warrant for his safety Wevehad him well guarded from the first and tonight he is behind a barreddoor with Mr Stairs overseer standing sentry before it But as forthat hes barely out of bed from my pinprickHaving thus disposed of me they let me be and came to the graverbusiness of the moment with a toast to lay the dust before it It wasFalconnet who gave the toastHeres to our bully redskins and their kingHow do you call himCaptain Stuart OconOconaOconostota is the Chelakee of it though on the border they know himbetter as Old Hop Fill up gentlemen fill up tis a dry businessthis Allow me Mr Stair and you MrerahPengarden This sameold heathen is the kings friend now but gentlemen all I do assureyou hes the very devil himself in a coppercolored skin Twas he whoambushed us in 60 and but for AttakullakullaOh Lord groaned Falconnet I say Captain drown the names in thewine and well drink them so Tis by far the easiest way to swallowthemBy this the grizzled captains mention of the old Fort Loudon massacreI knew him for that same John Stuart of the Highlanders who withCaptain Damar had so stoutly defended the frontier fort against thesavages twenty years before knew him and wondered I had not soonerplaced him When I was but a boy as I could well remember he had beenkings man to the Cherokees a sort of gobetween in times of peace andin the border wars a man the Indians feared But now as I was soon tolearn he was a man for us to fearTis carried through at last he went on when the toast was drunkAnd then he stopped and held up a warning finger This business willnot brook unfriendly ears Are we safe to talk it here Mr StairIt was Falconnet who answeredSafe as the clock You passed my sentry in the roadYesHe is the padlock of a chain that reaches round the house Lets haveyour news CaptainAs I was saying the Indians are at one with us Twas all fair sailingin the council at Echota the Chelakees being to a man fierce enough todig the hatchet up But I did have the devils own teapot tempest withmy Lord Charles He says we have more friends than enemies in the bordersettlements and these our redskins will tomahawk them all alikeI made a mental note of this and wondered if my Lord Cornwallis had metwith some new change of heart He was not oversqueamish as I had knownhim Then I heard the baronet sayBut yet the thing is doneAs good as done The Indians are to have powder and lead of us afterwhich they make a sudden onfall on the overmountain settlements Andthat fetches us to your part in it Sir Frank and to yours Mr StairYour troop Captain will be the convoy for this powder and you MrStair are requisitioned to provide the commissaryThere was silence while a cat might wink and then Gilbert Stair brokein upon it shrillyI can not Captain Stuart that I can not he protested starting fromhis chair Twill ruin me outright The place is strippedyou know itwell Sir Francisstripped bare and clean by these thieving rebelmilitiamen bare as the back of your hand I tell you IBut the captain put him down in briefEnough Mr Stair well not constrain you against your will But tishinted at headquarters that you are but a fairweather royalist atbestnay that for some years back you have been as rebel as the restin this nestingplace of traitors As a friendmind you as a friendIwould advise you to find the wherewithal to carry out my Lordscommands Do you take me Mr StairThe trembling old man fell back in his chair nodding his yes dumblylike a marionette when the string has been jerked a thought tooviolently and his weasel face was moist and clammy I know not whatdoubledealing he would have been at before this but it was surelysomething with the promise of a rope at the publishing of itSo he and his factor fell to ciphering on a bit of paper reckoning waysand means as I took it while Falconnet was asking for more particularordersYoull have them from headquarters direct said Stuart Oconostotawill furnish carriers a Cherokee escort and guides The rendezvouswill be hereabouts and your route will be the Great TraceThen we are to hold on all and wait still longerThats the word wait for the Indians and your cargoFalconnets oath was of impatienceWeve waited now a month and more like men with halters round theirnecks The country is alive with rebelsWhereupon Captain Stuart began to explain at large how the northernroute had been chosen for its very hazards the better to throw thepartizans off the scent I listened eager for every word but when thehorses stirred behind me I was set back upon the oftrecurrentunderthought of how the gloom did also hide a silent figure lyingprone with the three bridle reins knotted round its wristBut though the unnerving underthought would not begone the scenewithin the great room held me fast by eye and ear The master and hisfactor sat apart their heads together over the knotty problem ofsubsistence for the convoy troop At the tableend with the bottlegurgling now at one right hand and now at another the three kings mendrank confusion to the rebels and in the intervals discussed thepowderconvoys route across the mountains The senior plotter had somemap or chart of his own making and he was pricking out on it forFalconnet the route agreed upon in council with the CherokeesAt this cool outlaying of the working plan some proper sense of whatthis plot of savagearming meant to every undefended cabin on thefrontier seized and thrilled me I knew as every borderborn among usknew the dismal horrors of an Indian massacre and this these men wereplanning was treacherous murder on an unwarned people All was to bedone in midnight secrecy Supplied with ammunition the Cherokees ledby this Captain Stuart or some other were first to fall upon theovermountain settlements These laid waste the Indians were to form ajunction with the army of invasion and so to add the torch and tomahawkand scalping knife to British swords and musketsIt was a plot to make the blood run cold in my veins or in the veins ofany man who knew the cruel temper of these savages and when I thoughtupon the fate of my poor countrymen beyond the mountains I saw what laybefore meThe settlers must be warned in time to fight or flyBut while I listened with every faculty alert to reckon with the taskof rescue I take no shame in saying that the problem balked me Lackingthe strength to mount and ride in my own proper person there wasnothing for it but to find a messenger and who would he be in a regionat the moment distraught with wars alarums and needing every man forselfdefenseAt that I thought of Jennifer True he was wounded too but he wouldknow how best to pass the word to those in peril I made full sure hedfind a way if I could reach him and when I had it simmered down tothis the problem simplified itself I must have speech with Dick beforethe night was out though I should have to crawl on hands and knees thehalfscore miles to Jennifer HouseHaving decided I was keen to be about it while the night shouldlastthe friendly darkness and some fine flush of excitement whichagain had come at need to take the place of healthful vigor But when Iwould have quit the window to begone upon my errand a sober secondthought delayed me If my simple counterplot should fail some knowledgeof the powderconvoys route would be of prime importance Lacking thetime to warn the overmountain men the next best thing would be to setsome band of patriot troopers upon the trail and so to overtake theconvoy Nay on this second thoughts rehearsing the last expedientseemed the better of the two since thus the plot would come to naughtand we would be the gainers by the capture of the powderSo now you know why I should stick and hang by toe and fingertip andglare across the little space that gaped between my itching fingers andthe bit of parchment passed from hand to hand around the tables end IfI could make a shift to rob them of this mapIt was a desperate chance but in the frenzy of the moment I resolved totake it Their placings round the table favored me Gilbert Stair andthe lawyer sat fair across from me but they were still intent upontheir figurings Of the trio at the tables end the baronet and thecaptain had their backs to me The younger officer sat across and hewas staring broadly at my window though with winefogged eyes that sawnot far beyond the bottleneck I thoughtMy one hope hinged upon the boldness of a dash If I could spring withinand sweep the two candlesticks from the table there was a chance that Imight snatch the parchment in the darkness and confusion and escape as Ihad comeSo I began by inches to draw me up and feel for some better launchinghold But in the midst for all my care and caution I slipped and lostmy grip upon the casement lost that and got another on the woodenshutter opened back against the outer wall and then went down pullingthe shutter from its rusted hinges in crashing clamor fit to rouse thedeadAs if they were quick echoes other crashings followed as of chairsflung back and then the window just above me filled with crowdingfigures I marvel that I had the wit to lie quiet as I had fallen but Ihad and those above looking from a lighted room into the belly of thenight saw nothing Then Captain Stuart shouted to his dragoonhorseholderHo Tom Garget this way man he cried and when he had no answerput a leg across the window seat to clamber out Twas in the very actwhile I was watching catlike every movement that I saw the preciousscrap of parchment in his handHere was the chance I had prayed for Tom Gargets sword had clattereddown beside me and with it I sprang afoot and cut a whizzing circle bymy doughty captains ear that made him cringe and gasp and all buttumble out upon me The bit of parchment fluttered down and in a trice Ihad it safeYou may think small of me if so you must my dears when I confess whatfollowed after No man is braver than his opportunity and I had littlestomach for a fight with three unwounded men Hence it was narrowed nowto a bold sortie for the horses and this I made while yet the captainhung in air and sought his footholdWith all my breathless haste it was not done too soon nor soon enoughWhen I had quickly freed a horse from the dead hand that held ittethered and was making shift to climb into the saddle they throngedupon me the captain from his window the others pouring hotly throughthe gaping doorwayI made shift to get astride the horse to prick the poor beast with thepoint of sword and so to break away in some brief dash beneath theoaks But it was a chase soon ended As I remember I was reeling in thesaddle what time the foremost of them overtook me I held on grimly tillthe horse pursuing lapped the one I rode by head by neck and presentlyby withers Then I turned and would be making franticfeeble passes withthe sword at the man upon his backIt was my plotting captain who rode me thus to earth and when I thrusthe laughed and swore and turned the blade aside with his bare handThen pressing closer he struck me with his fist and thereupon thenight and all its happenings went blank as if the blow had been a cannonshot to crush my skullVIIIIN WHICH I TASTE THE QUALITY OF MERCYTwo ways there be to fetch a stunned man to his senses as they willtell you who have seen the rack applied one is to slack the tension onthe cracking joints and minister cordials to the victim the other togive the straining winch a crueller twist It was not the gentler way mycaptors took as you would guess and when I came to know and see andfeel again a pair of them were kicking me alive and I was sore andaching from their buffetingsHow long a time came in between my futile dash for liberty and thisharsh preface to their dragging of me back to the manor house I couldnot tell It must have been an hour or more for now a gibbous moon hungpale above the treetops and all around were bivouac fires and horsestethered to show that in the interval a troop had come and campedThe scene within the great foreroom of the house had been shifted tooA sentry was pacing back and forth before the doora Hessian grenadierby the size and shako of him and when the two trooper bailiffs thrustme in and I had winked and blinked my eyes accustomed to thecandlelight I saw the table had been swept of its bottles and glassesand around it sitting as in council were some halfscore officers ofthe British lighthorse with their colonel at the headAs it chanced this was my first sight near at hand Of that Britishcommander whose name in after years the patriot mothers spoke to frighttheir children He did not look a monster As I recall him now he was ashort squarebodied man younger by some years than myself and yetwith an old campaigners head well set upon aggressive shoulders Hiseyes were black and ferrety and his face well seasoned by the Carolinasun was swart as any Arabs A man I thought who could begentleharsh or harshrevengeful as the mood should prompt who couldmake wellturned courtier compliments to a lady and damn a trooper inthe selfsame breathThis was that Colonel Banastre Tarleton who gave no quarter tosurrendered men and when I looked into the sloeblack eyes I saw inthem for me a waiting gibbetSo he rapped out when I was haled before him Youre the spyingrebel captain eh Are you alive enough to hangHis lack of courtesy rasped so sorely that I must needs give place towrath and answer sharply that there was small doubt of it since I couldstand and curse himHe scowled at that and cursed me back again as heartily as anyfishwife Then suddenly he changed his tuneThey tell me you were in the service once and left it honorably I amloath to hang a man who has worn the colors Would it please you best todie a soldiers death Captain IretonI said it would most surelyHe said I should have the boon if I would tell him what an officer onthe Baron de Kalbs staff should know the strength of the Continentalsthe generals designs and dispositions and I know not what besides Ithink it was my laugh that made him stop short and damn me roundly inthe midstBy God Ill make you laugh another tune he swore You rebels areall of a piece and clemency is wasted on youYour mercy comes too dear you set too high a price upon it ColonelTarleton If for the mere swapping of a rope for a bullet I could bethe poor caitiff your offer implies hanging would be too good for meIf that is your last wordBut stay Ill give you an hour to think itoverIt needs not an hour nor a minute I replied If I knew aught aboutthe Continental armywhich I do notId see you hanged in your ownstirrupleather before Id tell you Colonel Tarleton Moreover Imarvel greatlyAt what he cut in rudelyAt your informants lack of invention He might have brought mestraight from General Washingtons headquarters while he was about itTwould be no greater lie than that he told youHe heard me through then fell to cursing me afresh and would besending an aidedecamp hotfoot for FalconnetWhile the messenger was going and coming there was a chance for me tolook around like a poor trapped animal in a pitfall loath to diewithout a struggle yet seeing not how any less inglorious end shouldoffer The eyesearch went for little of encouragement there was nochance either to fight or fly But apart from this the probing of theshadows revealed a thing that set me suddenly in a fever first of rageand then of apprehensionAs I have said this gatheringroom of our old house was in size like anancient banquet hall It had a gable to itself in breadth and heightand at the farther end there was a flight of some few steps to reach theolder portion of the house beyond The upper end of this low stairpierced the thick wall of the older house and in the shadows of theniche thus formed I saw my lady MargeryShe was standing as one who looks and listens and my ragefit blazedout upon the descrying of a shadowy figure of a man behind her a man Iguessed in jealous wrath to be the baroneta reasonless suspicionsince the volunteer captain would certainly have made his presence knownwhen his colonel had called for him But while my heart was yet afire mylady moved aside as if to have a better sight of us below and then Isaw it was the priest behind herWhile I was watching her and we were waiting yet upon theaidedecamps return there was a stir without and when it reached thedoor the sentry challenged Some confab followed and I overheard enoughto tell me that a scouting party had come in bringing a prisoner Thecolonel bade me stand aside and passed the word to fetch the prisonerbefore him When the thing was done I set my teeth upon a groan For itwas Richard JenniferLuckily he did not single me out among the bystanders being fresh comefrom the night without to the glare of candlelight within and whilethe swartfaced colonel plied him with questions I had a chance to lookhim up and down Though his arm was still in its sling he was seeminglythe better of his wound There was a glow of health and strengthreturning in cheek and eye and I thought him handsomer than ever whattime he stood forth boldly and fronted down the bullying colonelKnowing the Jennifer stock and its fine scorn of subterfuge I feared itwould go hard with Richard and so indeed it had gone lacking a wordin season from an enemy When Tarleton would have made him choosebetween the taking of the kings oath and captivity in the hulks atCharleston a burly Hessian captain at the table spoke the word inseasonVerdammt mine Colonel I vill know dis Mr Yennifer He is a praveyoong schalavags and he is not gone out mit der rebels Give him to mefor mine plundersThe colonel laughed and showed his teeth Having one man to hang hecould afford to be lenient with anotherWhat will you do with him Captain Lauswoulter By the look of him hedmake but indifferent sausagemeatVat shall I do mit him I shall make him mine best bows and send himhome py Gott Ve did had some liddle troubles mit der cards and venmine foot was slipped on dis verdammt greasegrass he did not run metrough so like he mightOh an affair of honor Well well count that in his favor Take himaway Trelawny and quarter yourself and twenty men upon him at JenniferHouse You have your parole Mr Jennifer but by the Lord if you breakit by so much as a wink or a nod Trelawny will hang you to your ownridgepoleGiven a hearing Jennifer would have spoiled it all by swearing hotly hehad given no parole but at the word the colonel roared him down like abull of Bashan and in the hubbub my brave lad was hustled outThough I was full to bursting with my news there was nothing I could doand when it was fairly over and he was gone I was right glad he had notseen me For I knew well his steeltrue loyalty and that at sight of mein trouble he would have lost his slender chance of guarded libertyand with it my last hope of sending word across the mountains thoughas for that the hope was wellnigh dead at any rateWhile Jennifers guard and quota were mounting at the door theaidedecamp returned and that without the baronet I caught but hereand there a word of his report enough to gather that the captainknightwas not yet in from posting out the sentriesI made no doubt his absence was designed He would have Margery believethat he had spared me honorably as an enemy wounded and so had left meto the tender mercies of his colonel well assured that Tarleton wouldnot spare me And this the colonel did not mean to do as I was now tohear in briefYou put a bold front on Captain Ireton but tis to no purpose thistime he began Tis charged against you that you rode here from thebarons camp with your commission in your pocket and came and wentwithin our lines like any other spy You are a soldier sir and youknow thats hanging Yet I will hear you if youve anything to sayI made so sure that I should hang in any case that it seemed foolish toanswer and so I saved my breath Withal he was the terror of ourSouthland this tyrant colonel gave me time to consider and while hewaited grim and silent the candles on the table guttered and ran downand the dim light failed till I could no longer see the face of her Iloved framed in the archway of the stairI thought it hard that I had seen my last of her sweet face thus throughthickening shadows as a dream might fade Nevertheless I would be gladthat I had seen her thus since otherwise I thought I must have gonewithout this last or any other sight of herIt was while I was still straining my eyes for one more glimpse of herand while the court room silence deepened dense upon us like theshadows that Colonel Tarleton signed to those who guarded me A handwas laid upon my shoulder but when I would have turned to go with thema womans cry cut sharp into the stillness Then before any one couldsay a word or think a thought my dauntless little lady stood beside meher eyes alight and all her glorious beauty heightened in a blaze ofgenerous emotionFor shame Colonel Tarleton she cried Do you come thus into myfathers house and take a wounded guest and hang him You say he is aspy but that he can not be for he has lain abed in this same house amonth or more You shall not hang himAt this there was a mighty stir about the table as you may guess andsome would smile and some would snuff the candles for a better sight ofher sweet face And through it all the while my heart went near tobursting at this fresh proof of her most fearless loyalty I ground myteeth in wrath that all those men should look their fill and say by winkand nod and covert smile that this were somewhat more than hostessloyaltyBut it was the colonels mocking smile that lashed me sharpest hissmile and what he said and yet not that so much as what he left to beinferredHa How is this Mistress Margery Do you keep open house for thekings enemies That spells treason my dear young lady and hath anugly look for you besidesIt should have no look at all save that of hospitality sir shecountered bravely Surely I may plead for justice to a wounded man whowas and is my fathers guestAnd yet he is a spy and spies must hangHe is no spyThe colonels bow made but a mock of true politenessYou should not make me contradict a lady Mistress Margery Tisevident you have not all his confidence He was captured redhanded inthe act at yonder window listening to that which he may never know andlive to prate about Besides he killed a sentry for his chance tolisten and for that Id hang him if he were my own fathers guestSo much he said as mild as if he had not left his reading of the law tofigure in our annals as King Georges butcher Then in a sudden gust ofrage he turned upon the priest cursing him brutally and threateningvengeance for his bringing of the lady to the court roomMy brave one stood a moment shocked as she had warrant for Thenbefore the priest or I or any one could stop her she ran to throwherself upon her knees at Colonel Tarletons feetto kneel and pleadfor me as I would gladly have died a thousand deaths rather than haveher plead for life for me or if not that at least for some briefrespite that the priest might shrive meAnd in the end she won the respite though I did think it far too dearlybought When he granted it the colonel lifted her and took her handbowing low over it with courtly deference For your sake MistressMargery it shall be put off till morning he said then gave theorder At dawn they would march me out and hang me and I would best beready For later than the sunrise of a new day the king himself mightnot delay my taking offYou know too much my cursing Captain was his parting word Were itnot for Mistress Margery and my promise you should not keep the breathto tell it over nightIXHOW A GOLDEN KEY UNLOCKED A DOORHaving my dismissal and reprieve I was remanded to the custody of thatyoung Lieutenant Tybee whom you have met and known as Falconnets secondin the duel Interpreting his orders liberally he suffered me to keepmy own room for the night I had expected manacles and a roommate guardat the least but my gentlemanly jailer spared me both When he had mesafe abovestairs he barred the door upon me set a sentry pacing backand forth in the corridor without and another to keep an eye upon thewindow from below and so left meThere was no great need for either sentry or for bolts and bars Whatwith the nights adventures and my scarcehealed wound I was far spedon that road which ends against the blind wall of exhaustion as you maywell suppose For while a man may borrow strength of wine or rage orpassion these lenders are but pitiless usurers and will demand theirpound of flesh aye and have it too when all the principal is spentSo when Tybee barred the door and left me with a single candle to mylighting I was fain to fall upon the bed in utter weariness thinkingthat the respite bought by my sweet ladys humbling was more dearlybought than ever and that the truest mercy would have been the rope andtree without this interval of waitingTo me in this grim Doubting Castle of despair the priest came He was agood man and a true this lowvoiced missioner to the savages and hewould be a curster man than I who failed to give him his due meed ofpraise and love For in this dismal interval of waiting with death sosure and near that all the air was growing chill and lifeless at itspresence he was a ready help in time of need If I were heretic tohim I swear I knew it not for aught he said or did and though Itrusted that when my time was come I should stand forth with some smallsimplehearted show of courage yet when he went away I felt I was thestronger for his coming And this mark you though I was stillunshriven and he had never named the churchly rite to meWhen he was gone I fell to wearing out the time afoot and lest youthink me harder than I was it may be said that while I did not makeconfession to the kindly priest I hope I tried to make my peace withGod in some such simpler fashion as our forebears did Twas none sogreat a matter for one who lives a soldiers life must needs be ripefor plucking hastilyBut in the final casting of accounts there was an item written down inred and one in black and these would not be scored across for all thetravail of a soul departing The one in black was bitter sorrow for thefate from which I might not live to save my loved one the one in redwas this that I should die and carry hence the knowledge that mightelse nip the Indian onfall in the budNo sooner was the priest away than I began to upbraid myself because Ihad not told him of this BritishIndian murder plan And yet on secondthought twas clear that it had been but a poor shifting of the burdento weaker shoulders and thankless too for Tarleton would be sure toput him on the questionrack to make him tell of all that passed betweenusAs I had let him go he would have naught to tell and so was safewhere otherwise he might be hanged or buried in the hulks for knowingwhat I knew No it were best he knew it not but how was I to rid me ofthis burdenof this and of that other laid upon me for my loveThe question asked itself a many a time and was as often answerlessbefore there came a stir without and voices in the corridor It was thechanging of the guard I guessed and so it proved since presently Iheard the clanking of the officers sword and double footfallsminishing into silenceThe sentry newly come paced back and forth to a lowhummed quickstep ofhis own bestirring himself as one who roused but now from sleepwould wake himself and be alert He made more noise than did the otherand that is why I marked it when the footfalls ceased abruptly A momentafterward the bar was lifted cautiously from its socket the latchclicked gently and the door swung open I looked and must needs lookagain to make assurance sure For on the threshold stood my ladyMargery and just behind her some broad figure of a woman whom I knewfor her stout Norman tiringmaidShe gave me little time for any word of welcome or of deprecation Whilestill I stood amazed she dragged the woman in with her and closed thedoor At that I found my tongueMargery Why have you come I spoke in French and she was quick tolay a finger on her lipSpeak to me in English if you please she whispered Jeanne knowsnothing and she need not know But you ask why I come could I do lessthan come dear friendI had always marveled that she could be so mocking hard at times and atother timesas nowso soft and gentle And though I thought it cruelthat I should have to fight my battle for the losing of her over againI had not the heart to chide herYou could have done much less dear lady I said taking her hands inmine much less and still be blameless You have done too much for mealready I would you had not done so much I would to God I had beenhanged before you went upon your knees to thatShe freed one hand and laid a finger on my lipnay it was her palmand if I took a dying mans fair leave and kissed it softly I think sheknew it notHush she commanded Is this a time to harbor bitter thoughts Ithought you might have other things to say to me Monsieur JohnThere is no other thing that I may sayNot anything at allNaught but a parting hope for you I hope you will be true and loyal toyourself Margery miaTo myself I do not understandI think you doI think you mustBut I do notI turned it over more than once in my mind if I should tell her all Ihad feared should tell her how I came to kill a man and was fair set tokill another had I found a wedding afoot in the great foreroom I couldnot bring myself to do it and yet I thought it would go hard with me ifI should leave her still unwarnedIf I should try to make you understand you will be angry as you werebeforeThe wicker chair was close beside the table and she sat down And whenshe spoke she had her hands tightclasped across her knee and would notlook at meIs itaboutSir FrancisIt is said I pausing once more upon the brink of full confessionShe waited patiently for me to speak further waited and let me fight itout in slow pacings up and down before her chair Without the night wascalm and still and through the opened casement came the measured beatof footfalls on the gravel where the outer sentry kept his watch beneaththe window Within the single candle battled feebly with the gloom andlighted naught for me save my dear ladys face pensive now and saintlysweet as it had been that morning when I had dwelt upon it the while sheknew it not And in the background stood the sleepy tirewoman givingno sign of life save now and then a tortured yawn behind her handI think my lady must have known how hard it was for me to speak forwhen the silence had grown overlong she said gently I bought theseflying minutes of the sentry Monsieur John Will you not use themIf I should say the thing I ought to say youll think the minutesdearly bought I fearNo that I shall not if it will ease your mindThen tell me why you sent for Father MatthieuThe light was dim as I have said yet I could see the faint flushspread from neck to cheekYou are not of the Church Monsieur John You would not understand if Ishould tell youI think I understand without your telling You said Sir FrancisFalconnet had asked for youTwas you who drove me to say itBecause I tried to warn youBecause you would be vengeful when you should have been forgivingTwas not revenge just then though while I live I shall have amplecause to hate this manWhat was it thenIt was love love for you andand Richard JenniferShe rose and I could see her eyes ashine for all the halfgloom of thecandlelightYou are a loyal friend she said and there was that within the wordsto make me glad whatever fate the dawn should have in store for meYou always think of others first you think of others now whenwhendeathOh Monsieur John what can I do for you Say quick The man iscoming to the doorNow I have told you this there is but one other thing Margery dearone little thing that will not let me die in peace If I might have tenwords with Richard JenniferShe left me in a feverflutter of excitement whipped to the door andhad a word with him who stood without I heard the chink of coin andthen she hastened back to me all eagerness and tremulous impatienceTell metell me instantly what I must do I am not afraid Shall Iride down to Jennifer House and fetch Dick hereHe is a prisoner and if he were not they would not let him see meBesides I would not let you go on such an errand And yetGod help meMargery there is many an innocent life hanging on this the lives ofhelpless women and little children Have you ever a messenger to send aman who will risk his life and can be trusted fullyYes yes she cried Write it down for me and Dick shall have itQuick for Our Ladys sake be quick about it O Sancta Maria materDeiThe low impassioned chant of the Roman litany was ringing in my ears asI sat down to the table to write my message to Richard Jennifer Therewere quills and an inkpot at hand but no paper I felt mechanically inmy pocket and found not some old letter as I hoped but the crumpledparchment map snatched and hidden when Captain Stuart had winced anddropped it at the bidding of the whistling sword about his earsHow it was they had not searched me for it I know not though haply thecaptain did not guess how he had lost it Be that as it might I had itsafe and Dick should have it safe and use it too to some goodpurpose as I fondly hopedYoud hardly think from the slow and clumsy spinning of this tale that Icould crowd the narrative of all that I had seen and heard into aniggard threescore words or less But this I did writing them upon themargin of the captains map and noting in an added line the prickingout of the powder convoys route And while my pen was looping on theflourish to my name my eager little lady seized the pouncebox sandedme the heavy trailings of the quill snatched and hid the parchment inher bosom and was goneAnd but for this that I heard the doorlatch click behind her and thenthe heavy wooden bar fall into place I might have thought thehappenings of the hour the unsubstantial fancies of a dreamXHOW A FORLORN HOPE CAME TO GRIEFAlthough I could not hope to know the outcome of this desperate cast tospeed the warning to the overmountain settlementscould never live toknow it as I thoughtI screened the candle and stood beside the openwindow not to see or hear but rather from the lack of sight or soundto gather some encouragement For sure I reasoned if Margerysmessenger should fail to pass the sentries there would be clamor enoughto tell me of itSo while the minutes of this safetysilence multiplied and there wasspace for sober afterthought I fell to casting up the chances ofsuccess Now that Margery was gone and with her all the fine enthusiasmthat such devoted souls as hers do always radiate it was plain enoughthat nothing less than a miracle could bring success Tarletons Legionwas made up of veterans schooled well in border warfare and though thebivouac seemed but a camp of motionless figures fast manacled insleepI could see them strewn like dead men round the smolderingfiresI made no doubt the sentries were alert and wakeful How thenwas any messenger of Margerys to pass the lines or passing them tocome at Jennifer who by this time would be at Jennifer House aprisoner in all but nameChewing such wormwood thoughts as these I watched and listened whilethe measured minutes circling slow on leaden wings pecked at my heartin passing and despair cold like a winter fog had chilled me to thebone For now it came to me that while I would be saving life mayhap Ihad been periling it again There was small doubt that if the messengerwere taken with my letter his life would pay the forfeit And if thefear of death should make him tell who sent him and to whom he wassentI had been careful so to word the letter as to shield mycorrespondentboth Margery and Dick would be involvedTis worthy of remark how building on the simplest supposition weseldom prophesy aright For all my finespun theories the manner of thething that happened was all unlike the forecast Suddenly and insilence out of the ghostly shadows of the trees and into the wanmoonlight of the open space beneath my window with neither shout norcrash of sentrygun to give me warning came three figures ridingabreasta man in trooper trappings on either hand and on the led horsesandwiched in between a womanYou may believe my heart went cold at the sight I knew at once what shehad donethis fearless maid who would be loyal to her friend at anycost Having no messenger she could trustshe knew it well when she hadpromised meshe had taken the errand upon herself braving a hazardthat would have daunted many a manI thought the worst had surely now befallen and wished a hundred timesthat I had died before it came to this But there was worse in storeHer captors passed the word while yet I looked and choked with rage andgrief and then the bivouac buzzed alive and men came running somewith arms and some with torches these last to flash the light upon herand to jeer and laugh At lengthit seemed an age to mean officerappeared to flog the rabble into order then she was taken from herhorse and led into the houseAnon the windows of the great foreroom flung bands of yellow torchlightout upon the lawn and I knew that Tarletons court was set again Atthat the pains of hell gat hold upon me and I did pray as I had neverprayed before that God would grant me this one boonto stand beside herin this time of trial to give me tongue of eloquence to tell them allthat she was innocent to give me breath to swear she knew not why shewent or what the message was she carriedYours is a skeptic age my dears and you have learned to scoff atthings you do not understand But so long as I shall live I mustbelieve that agonizing plea was answered While yet the anguish of itwrung my soul there came a hasty trampling in the corridor thesentrys challenge and then a quick unbarring of the door I turnedupon my heel to face a young ensign come with two men at his back totake me to the colonelThey bound me well and strongly with many wrappings of stout cord beforethey led me down Nor must you think me brokenspirited because I letthem In any other cause but this I hope I should have fought to dieunmanacled but now I suffered gladly this little seeing I had made mydear lady suffer so greatlyWhen we were come into the room below they let me stand beside her as Ihad prayed God they might and when I stole a glance at her I was fainto think my coming gave her courage and support For you must know theplace was fair alive with men and flaring light with torches and theyhad never offered her a chairThe colonel stood apart the center of a group of officers andFalconnet was with him Hovering on the edges of the group as if afraidto show themselves too boldly in such a coil were Gilbert Stair andthat smooth parchmentvisaged knave his factor The while they thrustme forth to take my place at Margerys side the good old priest cameand would have joined us but they would not suffer him[Illustration]So we two stood alone together as we had stood before but now my ladyseyes were downcast and her lips and cheeks were pale Yet she was morebeautiful than I had ever seen herso beautiful that I would swearthe sum of all the precious gifts in Gods great universe might beexpressed for me in this that I might die to save her from this shameand agonyWhen my guards had thrust me forward the colonel made short work of ourfresh offenseTwas a dastards trick my Captainthis tangling of the lady in yourtreason he began How did you get your speech with herThat is none of your affair Colonel Tarleton I retorted boldlythinking that with such a man the shortest word were ever the best YetI may say that the lady knew not what she did nor why As for mygetting speech with her she was not any way to blame I tampered withyour sentryBy God you lie was his comment on this She might have tamperedwith the guard and so got leave to keep a midnight tryst with you butnot you And then to my poor frighted love Have you no shameMistress Margery StairNow I have said that she was changeful as any child or April sky butnever had I seen her pass from mood to mood as she did then One momentshe stood a woman tremulous and tearful as any woman caught in desperatedeed the next she became a goddess vilified and if her look had been adagger I think her flashing eyes had killed him where he stoodYouve found a way to make me speak sir and I wish you joy of itTwas I who bribed your sentry and I did go to Captain Iretons roomThe colonel laughed and shot a gibe sharp at my enemyHow is this Sir Francis Did I not tell you you had thrust an inch orso too high By God sir I think you will come overlate if ever youdo come at all This captainemeritus hath forestalled you beautifullyAs more than once before in this eventful night the air went flamingred before my eyes and helpless wrath came uppermost I saw no way toclear her and had there been the plainest way dumb rage would stillhave held me tonguetied So I could only mop and mow and stammer andwhen the words were found make shift to blunder out that such anaccusation did the lady grievous wrong that she had come attended andat my beseeching to take a message from a dying man to one who was hisfriendFor my pains I had a brutal laugh in payment a laugh that startingwith the colonel went the rounds in jeering grins of incredulity Andon the heels of it the colonel swore afresh cursing me for a clumsyliarA likely story that he scoffed Next you will say she knew not whatthis message wasI said it once She knew not what the message was nor why I sent itI felt her eyes upon me as I spoke and turned to find them full oftearful pleading Oh tell the truth she whispered Dont you seeHe has the letterI looked and sure enough he held it in his hand and then I understoodthe flash of irony in the sloeblack eyes of himYou lie clumsily Captain Ireton though it is a gentlemanly lie anddoes you honor But we have trapped you fairly and you may as well makea clean breast of it Your mistress knew very well what you would haveher do and since she is your mistress went to do itWhile he was speaking I had a thought whitehot from some forgefire ofinspirationa thought to tip an arrow of conviction and set itquivering in the mark I would not stop to measure it to look aside ather or any other lest one brief glance apart should send the arrowwavering from its course So I looked the colonel boldly in the eye anddrew the bow and sped the shaftYou think no other than a mistress would have done this ColonelTarletonthat it was done for love Well so it was but with the lovethere went a dutyA duty say you How is thatI bowed as best I might being so tightly bound then fixed his eyeagainYou had forgot that honor is not wholly dead sir This lady is mywifeXIHOW A LIE WAS MADE THE VERY TRUTHFor some small instant I dared not loose my eyegrip on the colonel toglance aside at Falconnet or Gilbert Stair or at the woman closebeside me If I had flinched or wavered or let an eyelid droop but bythe thickness of a hair this keeneyed colonel would have been upon meto cut the ground beneath my feet and leave me dangling by the lieBut as it was I faced him down and winning him won all There was amuttered oath from Falconnet a tremulous cry of rage from where herfather stood and then I sought my ladys eyes to read my sentence inthemShe gave me but a glance and though I tried as I had never tried beforeto read her meaning it was hid from me But this I marked that she diddraw aside from me and that her face was cold and still and that herlips were pressed together as if not all nor any should ever make herspeak againAt this sharp crisis when a look or word would cost me more than deathand my dear lady her honor it was the colonel who all unwittinglystood my friend A breath of doubt upon my lie and we were lost andonce I thought he would have breathed it But he did not Instead hebroke out in a laugh with a gibe flung first at Gilbert Stair and thenat FalconnetGod save us I give you joy Mr Stair and you Sir Francis These twohave duped you bravely By heavens Sir Frank twas you who should havehad the sword thrust in the duel In that event you might have stood inCaptain Iretons shoes and so had the priest fetched for your benefitThen he turned to Margery with a bow that had no touch of mockery in itI crave your pardon Madam I knew not you were pleading for yourhusbands life an hour ago It grieves me that I may not spare him toyou longer than the night but war is cruel at its bestShe stood like any statue done in cold Carrara while he spoke and whenshe made no sign he gave the word to recommit meTake him away Lieutenant Tybee and see he has a bribeproof man thistime to keep him company Madam Ireton Ill put you on your honor youmay have access to him but there must be no messages carried in or outTo your quarters gentlemen We must ride far and hard tomorrowWhen his final word had set her free my frozen maiden came to life andran to throw herself in helpless sobbings not upon her father as youwould think but upon the good priest And it was Father Matthieu wholed her still crying softly out of the throng and up the low stairand now I marked that all the rough soldiery stood aside and made wayfor her with never a man among them to scoff or sneer or point a gibeAt her going Tybee drew his sword and cut the cord that bound meThese youngling cubs are overcautious Captain Ireton We shall notmake it harder for each other than we must he said with bluff goodnature And then Will you lead the way to your room sirthis togive the youngling cub another lesson I supposeI walked beside him to the stair and when I stumbled being weak andspent he took my arm and steadied me and I did think it kindly doneAt my own door he gave me precedence again saying with a touch of thegrateful Old World courtesy After you sir and standing aside to letme enter first When we were both within he touched upon the colonelsmandateI must obey my orders Captain Ireton but by your good leave I shallnot lock you up with any trooper Ill stay with you myselfI thought this still more kindly than aught he had done before and so Itold him But he put it off lightlyTis little enough any one can do for you my friend but I will dothat little as I can You are like to have a visitor I take it if youhave Im sure twill be a comfort if your bodyguard can be stoneblind and deafSo saying he dragged the big wicker chair into the windowbay plantedhimself deep within it with his back to all the room and so left me tomy own devicesBeing spent enough to sleep beneath the shadow of a gibbet I threwmyself fulllength upon the bed and was I think adrift upon the ebbtide of exhaustion and forgetfulness when once again the shifting of thewooden doorbar roused me I rose up quickly but Tybee was before meThere was some lowvoiced conference at the door then Tybee came to meTis Mr Gilbert Stair he said He has permission from the coloneland insists that he must see you solus Ill take your word and leaveyou if you likeAt first I hung reluctant wanting little of the host who came so lateto see his guest Then as if a sudden flash of lightning had revealedit I realized as I had not before how I had set the feet of my dearlady in a most hideous labyrinth of deception how this lie that I hadtold to bridge a momentary gap must leave her neither maid nor widow inthe morningYes yes for Gods sake let him in Mr Tybee I burst out I amfair crazed with weariness and had forgot Tis most important I doassure youThe thing was done at once and before I knew it I was alone with theold man who though he was my supplanter was also Margerys father Heentered cautiously shielding his bedroom candle with his hand andpeering over it to make me out as if his venturing in were notunperilous And I marked that when he put the candle down upon thetable he edged away and felt behind him for the door as if to make sureof his retreat in case of needSit down Captain Ireton sit down I beg of you he said in histhin rasping treble And when I had obeyed I think you must know whatIve come for Captain IretonI said I could guess and he began again volubly now as if to have itover in the shortest spaceTwas not a gentlemanly thing for you to do Captain Iretonthismarrying of a foolish girl out of hand while you were here a guest andas for the priest that did it IIll have him hanged before the armyleaves I promise you But now tis done I hope yere prepared to makethe best of itI saw at once that his daughter had not yet confided in him that he wasstill entangled in my lie So I thought it well to probe him deeperwhile I mightWhat would you call the best if I may ask said I growing thecooler with some better seeing of the way aheadThe marriage settlements he cried shrilly coming to the point atonce as any miser would Tis the merest matter of form as ye maysay for your title to Appleby Hundred is well burnt out I promise youBut for the decent look of it you might make over your quitclaim to yourwifeAye truly so I mightAnd so you should sir that you should ye miserable spyingrunaghe choked and coughed behind his hand and then began againwithout the epithets Tis the very least ye can do for her now whenyou have the rope fair around your cursahemyouryour rebel neckOnly for the forms sake to be sure ye understand for shed inheritafter you in any caseI saw his drift at last and not caring to spare him sped the shaft oftruth and let it find the joint in his harnessTis as you say Mr Stair But as it chances Mistress Margery is notmy wifeIf I had flung the candle at him where he stood fumbling behind him forthe doorlatchtwould not have made him shrink or dodge the moreWhawhats that ye say he piped in shrillest cadence Not marriedThen youyouI lied to save her honorthat was all A wife might do the thing shedid and go scot free of any scandal but not a maid as you could seeand hearFor some brief time it smote him speechless and in the depth of hisastoundment he forgot his foolish fear of me and fell to pacing up anddown though always with the table cannily between us And as heshuffled back and forth the thin lips muttered foolish nothings withhere and there a tremulous oath When all was done he dropped into achair and stared across at me with leaden eyes and truly he had thelook of one struck with a mortal sicknessI thinkI think you owe me something now beyond your keeping CaptainIreton he quavered at length mumbling the words as do the palsiedSince you are Margerys father I owe you anything a dying man canpay said IWords empty words he fumed If it were a thing to do nowYou need but name the thing and I will do it willinglyInstead of naming it he shot a question at me driving it home withcertain random thrustings of the shifty eyesWho is your next of kin Captain IretonSeptimus of the same name master of Iretondene on the James Riverand a major in the Virginia line I answered wondering how my cousinonce removed should figure in the present coil But Gilbert Stairs nextquestion dispelled the mysteryIf you should die intestate this Septimus would be your heirAs next of kin I should suppose he would But I have nothing todeviseTrue and yethe paused again as if the wording of it were not easyBe free to speak your mind Mr Stair said ITis this he cried gathering himself as with an effort Youveclaimed my daughter as your wife before them all and when you dietomorrow morning youll leave her neither wife nor maid I thinkIthink youd best make that lie of yours the truthIf one of his thin hands that clutched the chair arms had pressed asecret spring and loosed a trap to send me gasping down an oubliette Ishould have been the less astounded Indeed for some short space Ithought him mad yet on second thought I saw the method in hismadness Could Margery be brought to view it calmly this was a sword tocut the knot of all entanglementsAs matters stood the world would call her widow at my death and sincea woman is first of all the keeper of her own good name she would neverdare aver the truth So in common justice she should own the name theworld would call her by Again as matters stood no wrong could come ofit to her or Richard Jennifer or any Dick would love her none theless because a dying man had given her his name for some few hours Andif at any future time the Ireton title should revive and this poordoubledealing miser should be forced to quit his hold on ApplebyHundred my fathers acres would be hers in her own right One breach inall this suddenbuilded wall I saw but could not mend it With theIreton acres hers by double right the baronet would press his suit withgreater vigor than before But as to this no further act of mine couldhelp or hinder and if I died her husband she would in decency delay awhileSo summing up in far less time than it has cost to write it out for youI gave my host his answerI told you you might name the deed and I would do it Mr Stair Ifyou can make your daughter understandThe jade will do as she is bid he cut in wrathfully If she willdrag my good name in the mire Im damned if she shant pay the scotAnd now about the settlements Captain Ireton youll be making herlegatee residuaryAt this I saw his drift again most clearly that he would never sticklefor his daughters honor but for the quieting of his title to myfathers landsa title that my cousin Septimus might dispute It wasenough to set me obstinate against him but I constrained myself tothink of Margery and Richard Jennifer and not at all of this poor pettymiserIll sign a quitclaim in her favor if that is what you mean I saidBut tis a mere penscratch for the lawyers to haggle over As you saida while ago the wife will be the husbands heiratlaw in any eventTrue but wed best be at it in due and proper form He rose andhobbled to the door and was so set upon haste that his shaking handplayed a rattling tattoo on the latch IIll go and have the papersdrawn and you will sign them Captain Ireton I have your passed wordthat you will sign themAye they shall be signedHe went away at that and Tybee entered Much to my comfort thelieutenant asked no questions so far from it he crossed the roomwithout a word flung himself into the great chair and left me to my owncommuningsThese were not altogether of assurance Though I had promised readilyenough to make my lie a truth I saw that all was yet contingent upon myladys viewing of the proposal That I could win her over I had somehope if only they would leave the task for me But there was room tofear that this poor miser father would make it all a thing of propertyand so provoke her to resistance And notwithstanding what hesaidthat she would do as she was bidI thought I knew her temper wellenough to prophesy a hitch For I made sure of one thing that if sheput her will against the world the world would never move herTwas past midnight with Tybee dozing in his chair when next I heardsome stirrings in the corridor As before it was the lifting of thewooden bar that roused my friendly guard and when he went to parley atthe door I stood apart and turned my backWhen I looked again my company was come At the table busied with aparchment that might have been a ducal title deed for size stoodGilbert Stair and the factorlawyer Owen Pengarvin A little back ofthem the good old Father Matthieu had Margery on his arm And in thecorner Tybee stood to keep the doorI grouped them all in one swift eyesweep and having listed themstrove to read some lessoning of my part in my dear ladys face Shegave me nothing of encouragement nor yet a cue of any kind to lead towhat it was that she would have me say or do As I had seen it lastunder the light of the flaring torches in the room below her face wascold and still and she was standing motionless beside the priestlooking straight at me it seemed with eyes that saw nothingIt was the factorlawyer who broke the silence saying with hispredetermined smirk that the parchment was ready for my signatureThinking it well beneath me to measure words with this knavishpettifogger I looked beyond him and spoke to his masterI would have a word or two in private with your daughter before thismatter ripens further Mr Stair I saidMy lady dropped the priests arm and came to stand beside me in thewindowbay I offered her a chair but she refused to sit There was solittle time to spare that I must needs begin without preliminaryWhat has your father told you Margery I askedHe tells me nothing that I care to knowBut he has told you what you must doYes She looked with eyes that saw me notAnd you are here to do it of your own free willNoYet it must be doneSo he says and so you say But I had rather dieTis not a pleasing thing I grant you Margery notwithstanding ofour two evils it is by far the less Bethink you a moment tis but thesaying of a few words by the priest and the bearing of my name for someshort while till you can change it for a betterHer deepwelled eyes met mine and in them was a flash of angerIs that what marriage means to you Captain IretonNo truly But we have no choice Tis this or I must leave you in themorning to worse things than the bearing of my name I would it had notthus been thrust upon us but I could see no other waySee what comes of tampering with the truth she said and I could seeher short lip curl with scorn Why should you lie and lie again whenany one could see that it must come to thisor worseI saw it not I said But had I stopped to look beyond the momentsneed and seen the end from the beginning I fear I should have lied yetother times Your honor was at stake dear ladyMy honorthis in bitterest irony What is a womans honor sirwhen you or any man has patched and sewed and sought to make it wholeagain I will not say the word youd have me sayBut you must say it Margery Tis but the merest form you forget thatyou will be a wife only in name I shall not live to make you rue itYou make me rue it now beforehand Mon Dieu is a woman but a thingto stand before the priest and plight her troth for merest formYoull make me hate you while I liveand afterYoud hate me worse Margery dear if I should leave you drowning inthis ditch And I can bear your hatred for some few hours knowing thatif I sinned and robbed you I did make restitution as I couldShe heard me through with eyelids down and some fierce storm of passionshaking her And when she answered her voice was low and soft yet itcut me like a knifeYou drive me to itlisten sir you drive me to it And I have saidthat I shall hate you for it Come tis but a mockery as you say andthey are waitingI sought to take her hand and lead her forth but this she would notsuffer She walked beside me proud and cold and scornful stood besideme while I sat and read the parchment over It was no marriagesettlement it was a will drawn out in legal form And in it Ibequeathed to Margery Ireton as her true jointure not any claim ofmine to Appleby Hundred but the estate itselfI read it through as I have said and looking across to these twoplotters the misermaster and his henchman smiled as I had neverthought to smile againSo said I the truth is out at last I wondered if the confiscationact had left you wholly scatheless Mr Stair Well I am content Ishall die the easier for knowing that I have lain a guest in my ownhouse Give me the penTwas given quickly and I signed the will with Tybee and the lawyerfor the witnesses Margery standing by the while and looking on thoughnot I made sure with any realizing of the business matterWhen all was done the priest found his book and we stood before himthe woman who had sworn to hate and the man who loving her to fullforgetfulness of death itself must yet be cold and formal masking hislove for her dear sake and for the sake of loyalty to his friend Andhere again twas Tybee and the lawyer who were the witnesses the onewell hated and the other loved if but for this that when the time camefor the giving of the ring he drew a gold band from his little fingerand made me take and use itAnd so that deed was done in some such sorry fashion as the time andplace constrained and had you stood within the four walls of that upperroom you would have thought the chill of death had touched us and thatthe lowvoiced priest was shriving us the while we knelt to take hisbenediction All through this farcewhich was in truth the grimmest ofall tragediesmy lady played her part as one who walks in sleep and atthe end she let her father lead her out with not a word or look or signto meYoud guess that I would take it hardher leaving of me thus as I madesure for all eternity and I did take it hard For when the strain wasoff and there was no one by to see or hear save my goodhearteddeathwatch I must needs go down upon my knees beside the bed inchildish weakness and sob and choke and let the hot tears come as I hadnot since at this same bedside I had knelt a little lad to take mymothers dying loveXIIHOW THE NEWS CAME TO UNWELCOME EARSThough all the western quarter of the sky was nightblack and spangledyet with stars the dawn was graying slowly in the east when Tybeeroused meThey have not come for you as yet he said so I took time by theforelock and passed the word for breakfast It heartens a man to eat abite and drink a cup of wine just on the battles edge Will you sit andlet me serve you Captain IretonThat I will not said I adding that I would blithely share thebreakfast with him Whereat he laughed and clipt my hand and swore Iwas a true soldier and a brave gentleman to bootSo we sat and hobnobbed at the table and Tybee lighted all the remnantcandleends and broached the wine and pledged me in a bumper before wefell to upon the cold haunch of venisonMy summons came when we had shared the heeltap of the bottle It was mytoast to this kindhearted youngster and we drained it standing whattime the stair gave back the tread of marching men Tybee crashed hisglass upon the floor and wrung my hand across the tableGood by my Captain they have come God damn me sir Ill swear theymight do worse than let you go for all your spying Youve carried offthis matter with the lady as a gentleman should and whilst I live sheshall not lack a friend If you have any word to leave for herI shook my head No said I then on second thought And yet thereis a word You saw how I must see the matter through to shield theladySurely twas plain enough for any one to seeThen I shall die the easier if you will undertake to make it plain toRichard Jennifer He must be made to know that I supplanted him only ina formal way and that to save the ladys honorThe lieutenant promised heartily and as he spoke the oaken bar waslifted and my reprieve was at an endHaving the thing to despatch before they broke their fast my soldierhangmen marched me off without ado The house and all within it seemedyet asleep but out of doors the legion vanguard was astir and newlykindled campfires smoked and blazed among the trees In shortest spacewe left these signs of life behind and I began to think toward the endTis curious how sweet this troubled life of ours becomes when that daywakes wherein it must be shuffled off As a soldier must I thought Ihad held life lightly enough nay this I know I had often worn itupon my sleeve in battle But now when I was marching forth to thiscoldblooded end without the battlechance to make it welcome allnature cried aloud to meThe dawn was not unlike that other dawn a month past when I had riddendown the river road with Jennifer a morning fair and fine its cupabrim and running over with the wine of life I thought the cool moistair had never seemed so sweet and fragrant that natures garb had neverseemed so blithe There was no hint nor sign of death in all the woodedprospect The birds were singing joyously the squirrels scarce alarmedenough to scamper out of sight sat each upon his bough to chatter at usas we passed And once when we were filing through a bosky dell withsoftest turf to muffle all our treadings a fox ran out and stood withone uplifted foot and was as still as any stock or stone until he hadthe scent of usA mile beyond the outfields of Appleby Hundred we passed the legionpicket line and I began to wonder why we went so far wondered and madebold to ask the ensign in command turning it into a grim jest andsaying I misliked to come too weary to my endThe ensign a curst young popinjay as little officer cubs are like tobe answered flippantly that the colonel had commuted my sentence thatI was to be shot like a soldier and that far enough afield so thevolleying would not wake the houseSo we fared on and a hundred yards beyond this point of question andreply came out into an open grove of oaks then I knew where they hadbrought meand why Twas the glade where I had fought my losing battlewith the baronet On its farther confines two horses nibbledreinslength at the grass with Falconnets trooper servingman to holdthem and standing on the very spot where he had thrust me out myenemy was waitingTwas all prearranged for when the ensign had saluted he marched hismen a little way apart and drew them up in line with muskets ported Butat a sign from Falconnet two of the men broke ranks and came to strapme helpless with their belts I smiled at that and would not miss thechance to jeerYou are a sorry coward Captain Falconnet as bullies ever are Isaid Would not your sword suffice against a man with empty handsHe passed the taunt in silence and when the men had left me said Ihave come to speed your parting Captain Ireton You are a thickheadedwitless fool as you have always been yet since youve blundered intoserving me I would not grudge the time to come and thank youI serve you I cried God knows Id serve you up in collops at thetable of your master the devil could I but stand before you with acarving toolHe laughed softly Always vengeful and vindictive and always becauseyou must ever mess and meddle with other mens concerns he retortedAnd yet I say youve served meTell me how in Gods name that I may not die with that sin unrepentedofOh in many small ways but chiefly in this affair with the little ladyof ApplebyNever I denied So far as decent speech could compass it I haveever sought to tell her what a conscienceless villain you areHe laughed again at thatYou know women but indifferently my Captain if you think to breach alove affair by a cannonade of hard words But I am in no humor todispute with you You have lost and I have won and were I not here tocome between youd look your last upon the things of earth in shortestorder I do assure youYouyou come between I scoffed You are all kinds of a knave SirFrancis but your worst enemy never accused you of being a foolThere was a look in his eyes that I could never fathomYou are bitter hard John Iretonbitter and savage and unforgivingYou knew the wild blade of a halfscore years ago and now youd makethe grown man pay scot and lot for that same youngsters misdeeds Haveyou never a touch of human kindliness in youTo know how this affected me you must turn back to that place where Ihave tried to picture out this man for you I said he had a gift to turna womans head or touch her heart I should have said that he could usethis gift at will on any one For the moment I forgot his cool disposalof me in the talk with Captain Stuart forgot how he had lied to make meout a spy and so had brought me to this passSo I could only say You killed my friend Frank Falconnet andTush said he That quarrel died nine years ago Your reviving of itnow is but a maskFor what I askedFor your just resentment in sweet Margerys behalf Believe it or notas you like but I could love you for that blow you gave me JohnIreton I had been losing cursedly at cards that day and mine hostswine had a dash of usquebaugh in it I dare swear At any rate I knewnot what it was I said till Tybee said it over for meBut the next morning you took a curs advantage of me on this very spotand ran me through I counteredName it what you will and let it go at that There was murder in youreye and you are the better swordsman You put me upon it for my lifeand when you gave me leave I did not kill you as I mightNo you reserved me for thisHe took a step nearer and seemed strangely agitatedYou forced my hand John Ireton he said speaking low that the othersmight not hear You had her ear from day to day and used yourprivilege against me As an enemy who merely sought my life forvengeances sake I could spare you but as a rivalI laughed and sanity began to come again Make an end of it I saidId rather hear the muskets speak than youFor reply he took a folded paper from his pocket and spread and held itso that I might read It was a letter from my Lord Cornwallis directingCaptain Falconnet to send his prisoner Captain John Ireton sometimelieutenant in the Royal Scots Blues under guard to his Lordshipsheadquarters in South CarolinaCan you read it he askedI noddedWell this supersedes the colonels sentence If I say the word toEnsign Farquharson you will be remandedTo be shot or hanged a little later I supposeNo Have you any notion why my Lord Charles is sending for youNo said I in my turn and indeed I had notHe knows your record as an officer and would give you a chance tolist in your old serviceI would not take itat your hands or hisYoud best take it But in any event youll have your life andhonorable safeconduct beyond the linesMake an end I said again I understand you will obey his Lordshipsorder or disregard it as your own interest directs What would youhave me doA very little thing to weigh against a life Mr Gilbert Stair is myvery good friendI let that go uncontradictedHis title to the estate is secure enough as you know but you can makeit better he went onThis saying of his told me what I had only guessed that as yet he hadnot been admitted into Gilbert Stairs full confidence also that hehad no hint of what had taken place in my chamber some hour or two pastmidnight At that a joy fierce like pain came to thrill meGo on said IYour route to Camden lies through Charlotte Your guard will give youtime and opportunity to execute a quitclaim in Mr Stairs favorIs that all I askedNo after that our ways must lie apartor yours and Margerys at allevents Give me your word of honor that you relinquish any claim youhave or think you have upon her and I pass this letter on to theensignAnd if I refuseHe came so near that I could see the lurking devil in his eyesIf you refuse Harken John Ireton if you had a hundred lives tothrust between me and the thing I crave Id take them all So much hesaid calmly then a sudden gust of passion seized him and for once Ithink he spoke the simple truth God Id sink my soul in Calvinshell to have herI could not wholly mask the smile of triumph that his words evoked Thisfox of maiden vineyards was entrapped at last I saw the fire of such apassion as such a man may know burning in his eyes and then I knew whyhe was come upon this errandSo said I Then Mistress Margery sent you here to save me Twasbut a guess but I made sure it hit the truthHe swore a sneering oath So the priest carried tales did he Wellmake the most of it she would not have her fathers guest taken fromhis bed and hanged like a dogI smiled again Twas more than that she would even go so far as tobeg her husbands life a boon from that same husbands mortal enemyBah he scoffed That lie of yours imposed upon the colonel but Ihad better informationA lie you say True twas a lie when it was uttered But afterwardsome hour or so past midnight by the good help of Father Matthieu andwith your Lieutenant Tybee for one witness and the lawyer for anotherwe made a sober truth of itI hope for your own peace of mind my dears that you may never see afellow human turn devil in a breath as I did then His mans face fellaway from him like a vanishing mask and in the place of it a hideousdemon malignant and murderous glared upon me Twice his hand soughtthe swordhilt and once the blade was half unsheathed Then he thrusthis devilface in mine and hissed his parting word at me so like a snakeit made me shudder with abhorrenceYouve signed your own death warrant you witless fool Youd play thespoilsport here as you did once before would you Curse you I wishyou had a hundred lives that I might take them one by one Then hewheeled sharp upon his heel and gave the order to the ensign Belt himto the tree Farquharson and make an end of him Ive kept you waitingoverlongThey strapped me to a tree with other belts and when all was ready theensign stepped aside to give the word Just here there came a littlepause prolonged beyond the moment of completed preparation I knew notwhy they waited having other things to think of I saw the firing linedrawn up with muskets leveled I marked the row of weatherbeaten facespillowed on the gunstocks with eyes asquint to sight the pieces Iremember counting up the pointing muzzles remember wondering whichwould be the first to belch its fire at me and if at that short rangea man might live to see the flash and hear the roar before the bulletskilled the sensesBut while I screwed my courage to the sticking place and sought to holdit there the pause became a keenedged agony A glance asidea glancethat cost a mightier effort than it takes to break a nightmareshowedme the ensign standing ear acock as one who listensWhat he heard I know not for all the earth seemed hushed to silencewaiting on his word But on the instant the early morning stillness ofthe forest crashed alive and pandemonium was come A savage yell to setthe very leaves atremble a crackling volley from the underwood thatleft a heap of writhing dying men where but now the firing squad hadstood then a headlong charge of roughclad horsemenall this befell inless than any time the written words can measureI sensed it all but vaguely at the first but when a passing horsemanslashed me free I came alive and life and all it meant to me wascentered in a single fierce desire Falconnet had escaped the fusilladewas making swiftly for his horse safe as yet from any touch of lead orsteel So I might reach and pull him down I cared no groat whatfollowed afterIt was not so to be In the swift dash across the glade I went too nearthe shambles in the midst The corporal of the firing squad a beardedSaxon giant whose face hideously distorted will haunt me while Ilive lay fairly in the way his heels drumming in the death agony andhis great hands clutching at the empty airI leaped to clear him In the act the clutching hands laid hold of meand I was tripped and thrown upon the heap of dead and dying men andcould not free myself in time to stop the baronetI saw him gain his horse and mount saw the flash of his sword and theskilful parry that in a single parade warded death on either hand sawhim drive home the spurs and vanish among the trees with hishorseholding trooper at his heelsAnd then my rescuers or else my newer captors picked me up hastilyand I was hoisted behind the saddle of the nearest and so was borneaway in all the hue and cry of a most unsoldierly retreatXIIIIN WHICH A PILGRIMAGE BEGINSAs you have guessed before you turned this page the men who charged soopportunely to cut me out of peril were my captors only in the savingsenseTheir overnight bivouac was not above a mile beyond the glade ofambushment It was in a little dell cunningly hid and the embers ofthe campfires were still alive when we of the horse came first to thisagreedon rallying pointHere at this rendezvous in the forests heart I had my first sight ofany fighting fragment of that undisciplined and yet unconquerablepatriot homeguard that even in defeat proved too tough a morsel forBritish jaws to masticateThey promised little to the eye of a trained soldier these borderlevies In fancy I could see my old fieldmarshalhe was the father ofall the martinetsturn up his nose and dismiss them with acontemptuous Ach mein Gott And truly there was little outwardshow among them of the sterling metal underneathThey came singly and in couples straggling like a routed band ofbrigands some loading their pieces as they ran There was no hint ofsoldier discipline and they might have been leaderless for aught I sawof deference to their captain Indeed at first I could not pick thecaptain out by any sign since all were clad in coarsest homespun andwellworn leather and all wore the long fringed hunting shirt andraccoonskin cap of the free borderersYet these were a handful of the men who had fought so stoutly againstthe Tory odds at Ramsours Mill their captain being that Abram Forneyof whom you may read in the histories and though they made no militaryshow they lacked neither hardihood nor courage of a certainpersevering sortEver come any closter to your Amen than that stranger drawled one ofthem a grizzled borderer lank lean and weathertanned with a facethat might have been a leathern mask for any hint it gave of what wenton behind it Ill swear that little whipsnap officer cub had theword Fire sticking in his teeth when I gave him old Sukeys mouthfulo lead to chaw onI said I had come as near my exit a time or two before though always infair fight and thereupon was whelmed in an avalanche of questions suchas only simplehearted folk know how to askWhen I had sufficiently accounted for myself Captain Forneyhe was thelimberbacked young fellow I had ridden behindgripped my hand andgave me a hearty welcome and congratulationMy father and yours were handfast friends Captain Ireton More thanthat Ive heard my father say he owed yours somewhat on the score ofgood turns Im master glad Ive had a chance to even up a littlethough as for that we should both thank the Indian At which he lookedaround as one who calls an eyemuster and marks a missing man Where isthe chief Ephraimthis to the grizzled hunter who was methodicallyreloading his long rifleHes back yonder gathering in the haircrop I reckon Never you mindabout him Capn Hell turn up when he smells the meat acookingimmejitly if not soonerHere as I imagine I looked all the questions that lacked answers forCaptain Forney took it in hand to fit them out with explicationsTis Uncanoola the Catawba he said one of the friendlies He wasout ascouting last night and came in an hour before daybreak with thenews that Colonel Tarleton was set upon hanging a spy of ours From thatto our little ambushmentI see said I wanting space to turn the memory leaves This Catawbais he a man about my age Captain Forney laughed God He only knows anIndians age But Uncanoola has been a man grown these fifteen years ormore I can recall his coming to my fathers house when I was but alittle cadgerAt that I remembered too remembered a tall straight young savageas handsome as a figure done in bronze who used sometimes to meet me inthe lonelier forest wilds when I was out ahunting remembered how atfirst I was afraid of him how once I would have shot him in a fit ofboyish race antipathy and sudden fright had he not flung away hisfirelock and stood before me defenselessAlso I recalled a little incident of the terrible scourge in 60 whenthe black pox bade fair to blot out this tribe of the Catawbas how whenmy father had found this young savage lying in the forestplaguestricken and deserted by all his tribesmen he had saved his lifeand earned an Indian friendshipI know this Uncanoola I said My father befriended him in the plagueof 60 and was never sorry for it as I believe Then I would ask ifthese Catawbas had ranged themselves on the patriot side a questionwhich led the young militia captain to give me the news at large whilehis borderers were breaking camp and making their hasty preparations forthe days marchTis liberty or death with us now weve burnt our bridges behind ushe said when he had confirmed the tidings I had had the day before fromFather Matthieu And since here in Carolina we have to fight each managainst his neighbor tis like to go hard with us lacking help fromthe NorthMeasured by this mornings work Captain Forney these irregulars ofyours seem well able to give a good account of themselves I venturedHe shook his head doubtfully He was but a boy in years but war is ashrewd schoolmaster and this youth like many another on the fightingfrontier had matriculated earlyYouve seen us at our best he amended We can ambush like theIndians fire a volley yell chargeand run awayWhats that yere saying youngster The grizzled hunter had finishedreloading his rifle and lounging in earshot with all the freedom ofthe border would take the captain up sharply on this lastYou heard me Eph Yeates replied my young captain curtlyThe old man leaned his rifle against a tree spat on his hands cut aclumsy caper in air and gave tongue in a yell that should have beenheard by Tarletons men at ApplebyBy the eternal coonskins I can gouge the eye out of ary man that saysEph Yeates carnt stand up fair and square and whop his weight inwildcats and I can do it now if not sooner he shrilled Come onyou papeating apronstringed FrenchdaddiedWhere the blast of vituperative insult would have spent itself innatural course we were not to know for in the midst another of theborderers a wiry little man in greasy deerskin came up behind thecapering ancient whipped an arm around his neck and in a trice the twowent down kicking scratching buffeting and mauling as like to apair of battling bobcats as was ever seenFor a moment I thought my youngster would let them have it out to thefinish but he did not At his order some of the others pulled the twainapart reluctantly I fancied and when the thing was done the old mancaught up his rifle and strode away in blackest wrath without a lookbehind himCaptain Forney shrugged and spread his hands as his French father mighthave doneNow you know wherein our weakness lies Captain Ireton he saidThere goes as true a man and as keen a shot as ever pulled trigger Lethim fight in his own way and hell take cover and name his man forevery bullet in his pouch But as for yielding to decent authority orstanding against trained troops in open field He shrugged again andturned to tighten his saddlegirthI see said I Then I asked him of his plans and intendings and wastold that he and his handful were amarch to join General Rutherfordwho was gone to the Forks of Yadkin to break up some Tory embodimentthereaboutsYou have your work cut out to dodge the British lighthorse CaptainForney said I capping the venture by telling him what little I knewof Tarletons dispositions and also of the Indianarming plot I hadoverheardWell dodge the redcoats never you fear were at our best in thathe rejoined carelessly And as to the Cherokee upstirring thats anold story The kings men have tried it twice and they have not yetcaught Jack Sevier or Jimmie Robertson anapping Ease your mind on thatscore Captain Ireton and come along with us if you have nothingbetter to do I can promise you hard living and hard fighting enough tokeep it in countenanceAt this I was brought down to some consideration of the present and itsdemands As fortunes wheel had twirled I had my life to be sure butby the having of it was made the basest traitor to my friendtoJennifer and no whit less to MargeryTwas out of any thought that I should take the field against the commonenemy leaving this tangled web of mystery and misery behind Insheerest decency I owed it first to Jennifer to make a swift and frankconfession of the illconcluded tale of happenings That done I owed itequally to him and Margery to find some way to set aside the midnightmarriageSo I fell back upon my wound for an excuse telling the captain that Iwas not yet fit to take the fieldwhich was true enough Whereupon heand his men set me well beyond the danger of immediate pursuit and weparted companyWhen I was left alone I had no plan that reached beyond the days endSince to go to Jennifer House by daylight would be to run my neck afreshinto the noose I saw nothing for it but to lie in hiding tillnightfall The hiding place that promised best was the old hunting lodgein the forest and thitherward I turned my faceIt was a wise man who said that he who goes with heavy heart dragsheavy feet as well but while I live I shall remember how that sayingclogged the path for me that morning making the shrubsweet summer airgrow thick and lifeless as I toiled along For sober second thought andthe unnerving reaction which comes upon the heels of some sharp periloverpast left me aghast at the coil in which a tricky fate hadentangled meThe second thought made plain the dispiteous hardness of it all showingme how I had reasoned like a boy in planning for retrieval WouldJennifer believe my tale though I should swear it out word for word onthe Holy Evangelists I doubted it and striving to see it through hiseyes was made to doubt it more For death should have been myjustifier and death had played me falseAs for setting the midnight marriage aside I made sure the lawyer tribecould find a way if that were all But here there was a loyal daughterof the Church to reckon with Loathing her bonds as any trueheartedmaiden must would Margery consent to have them broken by the law Iknew well she would not Though our poor knotting of the tie had beenlittle better than a tragic farce it lacked nothing of force to bindthe tender conscience of a woman bred to look upon the churchly rite asfinalSo twist and turn it as I might the coil was desperate and as Istrode on gloomily measuring this the first stage in a pilgrimage I hadnever thought to make a fire of sullen anger began to smoke andsmolder within me and I could find it in my heart to curse the cruelkindness of my rescuers to sorrow in my inmost soul that they had comebetween to make a living recreant of one who would fain have died anhonest manXIVHOW THE BARONET PLAYED ROUGEETNOIRThe sun was well above the treetops and the morning was abroad for allthe furred and feathered woodfolk when I forsook the Indian path tomake a prudent circle of reconnaissance around the cabin in the maplegroveHappily there was no need for the cautionary measure The hunting lodgewas undiscovered as yet by any enemy and when I showed myself my poorblack vassals ran to do my bidding weeping with childish joy to have meback againSince old Darius was still at Appleby Hundred Tomas ranked asmajordomo and I bade him post the blacks in a loosely drawn sentry lineabout the cabin this against the chance that Falconnet might stumble onthe place in searching for me For I made no doubt his Tory spies wouldquickly pass the word that I was not with Abram Forneys band and hencemust be in hidingWhen all was done I flung myself upon the couch of pantherskins hopingagainst hope that sleep might come to help me through the hours ofwaiting Twas a vain hope There was never a wink of forgetfulness forme in all the long watches of the summer day and I must lie wideeyedand haggard thinking night would never come and making sure that fatehad never before walled a man in such a dungeon of despairThere was no loophole of escape with honor The heavens were brass withall the horizons narrowed to a bounding wall to hem me in on every sideThere was no sallyport in all this wall save onethe one that deathhad promised to open at the dawn The promise had been broken Truedeath had thrust the key within the lock and I had heard the grating ofthe bolts and yet the key had been withdrawn and I was left a prisonerof lifeThere was no hope of other outlet Now there was space to view itcalmly I saw how foolish was the thought that Margery would connive atany breaking of the marriage bond She would bear my name and hate mefor the giving of it would go on hating me I thought to all eternitybut she would never take her freedom back again save at a dead manshandsIt was thus that each fresh scanning of the prison wall that shut me inthis dungeon of dishonor fetched me once and again to this onesallyport of death And when it came to this that I had searched invain for other outlet you will not think it strange that I sat down inspirit at this postern to see if I might open it with my own handsIt was not love of life that made me hesitate At twoscore years hewho has lived at all has lived his best and if he live beyond theturning point of youthful ardor he must beg the grace of younger men tolinger yet a little longer on the stage which once was his and now istheirsNo it was not any love of life for lifes own sake that held me backTwas rather that the Ireton blood is linked up with that thing we calla conscience a heritage from those simplehearted ancestors to whom thesuicide was a soul accursta soul impenitent whose very outer husk offlesh and bones they used to bury at the crossing of the ways with asharpened stake to pinion itTwas this ancestral conscience made me cowardly and when the sight ofmy fathers swordDarius had rescued and restored it to its place uponthe chimneybreastwould set me thinking of the Israelitish king andhow when all was lost he fell upon his blade and died this horror ofthe suicide came to give me pauseBesides that way to right the double wrong was not so clear as it mightseem As matters stood my living for the present was Margerys bestsafeguard Till she became my widow and my heiratlaw the mercenarybaronet would play his cards to win her honorably I doubted not hedmake hot love to her but while she stayed a wife and was not yet awidow hed keep his passion decently in bounds if only for the bettercompassing of his endBut from this horn of the dilemma I slipped to fall upon the other Ifmy living on as Margerys husband was her safety for the time it was anoffering of idolmeats upon the altar of my dear lads friendship Whatwould he think of me How could I go about to make it plain that I hadrobbed him for his own honors sakethat it was not I but fate thatwas to blameThese questions came up answerless like deepsea plummets where nobottom is I saw the way no farther on than this that I must gostraightway to Jennifer and tell him all Beyond that point the darknesswas Egyptian and I could only hope that tricky fate would turn againand blot me out and make it plain to Richard and to my dear lady thatlove and not base treachery had set me on to do as I had doneIn some such dismal grindings of the mill of thought the hours ofwaiting were outworn at length and when the sun was dipping to themountains in the west I rose and washed me in the brook and afterwardconstrained myself to eat what Tomas had prepared for meThe sunset glow was fading in the upper air and underneath the canopyof leaves the wood was darkening on to twilight when I made ready to begone Because I thought I might have need of it before the night wasdone I buckled on the heirloom sword and telling Tomas and the otherblacks for their own safety to keep an alarm guard waking through thenight I sallied forth upon my errandIve wished a thousand times as I sit here before the fire and jotthese memories down in crabbed black on white that I could conjure upfor you some speaking picture of this scene primeval in which the storymovesTrue its hills and valleys are the same the river keeps its courseand in the west the mountain skyline is unchanged But here similitudeis at an end Youve hacked the virgin forest into shapes and fringeswhere once it was an ample mantle seamed only by the rivers and frayedhere and there at distant intervals by the settlers axBeneath this mantle lay a world unlike the world you know Plunged inits furtive depths you felt the spell of natures mystery upon you themystery of the hoary wood ageold steeped in the nepenthe of thecenturies In brightest summer day which in these forest aislesbecame a misty green translucence the silence the vastness thesolitude laid each a finger on you bidding you go softly all the wayBut in the twilight hour the real held still more aloof and all theshadows bristled with dim fantastic shapes to awe and affright thealienbornI was not alienborn From earliest childhood I had known and lovedthese forest solitudes Yet now as when I was a little lad thetwilight shadows awed me Here it was a gnarled and twisted treetrunkso like a crouching panther that I sprang aside and had the steel halfout before the clearer vision came There it was the figure of a mangliding stealthily from tree to tree it seemed keeping even pace withme as if with sinister intentI pushed on faster drawing the sword to keep me better company thoughinwardly I scoffed and jeered at this new twittering of the nerves Whatthreat was there for me in silent shadows in the wood The dogs I had tofear were bred in British kennels and there was never any lack ofclamor when they were beating up a coverYet this persistent shadow clung upon my footsteps until from castingfurtive glances sidewise I came to holding it craftily in the tail of myeye Twas surely moving as I moved and surely drawing nearer I pickeda time and place measured my distance and darting suddenly aside senthome a thrust which should have pinned the phantom to a treeUgh What for Captain Longknife want kill the treeThe voice came from behind and when I wheeled again my shadow wasbecome incarnated in flesh and blood a stalwart Indian naked to thebelt standing so near he could have pricked me with his scalping knifeIt was Gods mercy that by some swift intuition I knew him for thefriendly Catawba It is an ill thing to take a frighted man unawaresUncanoola said IHe nodded Where bouts Captain Longknife goingI told him briefly whereat he shook his headNo find Captain Jennif this way find him that way pointing backalong the pathHow does the chief know that Has he seen him Though my long exilehad wellnigh cost me the trick of it I made shift to drop into thestately Indian hyperboleWah Uncanoola has seen the Great Water that make him have longeyessee heap thingsWill the Catawba tell the friend whose life he saved what he has seenUncanoola see heap things he repeated See Captain Jennif sohethrew himself flat upon the ground and pictured me a fugitive crawlingsnakelike through the underwood Bimeby come to river and findcanoejump in and paddle fas bimeby gain stop paddling and laughand shake fist this way and say GoddamnBy this I knew that Jennifer had escaped nay more had somehow learnedof my escape and was seeking meIs that all the chief saw I askedUgh See heap more things see one thing white squaw no let him tellCaptain Longknife Maybe some time tell anyhowThe white squaw said I Who is sheThe Catawba laughed an Indian laugh silent and suppressed a mereshaking of the ribsNo can tell that neither too he said Then with a swift dart asidefrom the subject Captain Longknife care much bout black dogsyonderI knew he meant the negroes at the hunting lodgeThe white man cares for the black as a kind master should I returnedThe Indian spat upon the ground in token of his hatred and contempt forall the black skins in his fatherland I never understood this bitterrace antipathy between the red and black but tis a tale well writtenout in many a bloody massacre of that earlier dayThe wolves will kill all the black dogs and drink their blood beforethe moon is awake Uncanoola has spokenI sheathed my sword and turned to take the backward traceCaptain Longknife will go and fight for his black dogs with wool ontheir heads he queriedIf need be I assertedWah he ejaculated and at the word was gone as if the earth hadswallowed himI lost no time in indecision Since Jennifer was abroad I had nobusiness at the plantations and if Tomas and the other refugees werelike to come to harm I could do no less than hasten back to warn orhelp themSo I retraced my steps hurriedly as the business urged and saw nomore shadows in the ancient woodin truth had much ado to see thesingle step ahead so thickly did the darkness gather in those skylessdepthsI was breasting the last low hill was come so near that I could hearthe murmur of the river when in the farthest hazy vista of thetreetops a softened glow appeared changing the black to green andthen to red Twas like the childish Africans I said to draw a secretsentry line for safetys sake and then to build a fire to advertise itfar and wide Truly the Catawbas wolves might find an easyA chattering scream of agony sent shrill and sharp upon the stillness ofthe night halted me and broke the gibing comment in the midst I stoodand listened The cry rang out again then I loosed the Andrea in itsscabbard and fell arunning though the halfhealed wound scanted mesorely of the breath I wantedThe cabin clearing or rather the thinnedout grove which stood in lieuthereof was but a niggard acre hemmed in on every side save thattoward the river by the virgin forest For cover there were hollythickets here and there and into one of these I plunged creeping onhands and knees to gain a hidden viewpointThe scene in the little clearing was one to brand itself in lastingshapes upon the memory A brush heap newly kindled gave out a dusky glowflaring in waves of smoky red against the overarching foliage The openspace around the cabin was alive with halfnaked savages running to andfro and in the gloom beyond the fire I saw a shadowy horseman backed byothers still more phantomlikeThere was no mystery about it My enemy had come with sleuthhoundIndians at his back to run me down The savages were no doubt thatband of overmountain Cherokees pledged by their chief to pilot thepowder convoy and by their help the baronet had tracked meThis was the first thought caught at in passing but when I came tolook again I saw what had been done Sprawled on the ground before theburning brush pile his wrinkled face a hideous mask of suffering withthe eyeballs starting from their sockets in the deathwrench lay myfaithful DariusBy what inhuman tortures they had made him point the way or how or whythey slew him at the last I know not but I made sure it was hisdeathscream that had halted me and set the stillness of the forestalive with ghastly echoesAt sight of the stiffening body of the faithful slave you may suppose myblood ran cold and hot by turns and that his blood cried out forvengeance from the sod that soaked it up With ten years more of youthand less of age I might have tried to hew my way to Falconnets stirrupand so to square accounts with him But had I been amind to rush uponthe stage without my cue another climax in the ghastly tragedy forbadeitThis climax turned upon the capture of my horseboy Tomas The otherblacks it seemed had made good their escape but Tomas lagging behindthrough fear or foolishness had given these coppercolored devils leaveto run him down and drag him back into the fire light with yells ofsavage triumphThey flung him down upon his knees beside the captains horse andthough I caught but here and there a word above the frenzied yipping ofthe Indians it was plain the baronet was asking him of meI could not hear the black boys gibbering answers but that he wouldnot tell them what they wished to knowcould not indeed since I hadleft no word behind to track me bywas quickly evident A cord wasfound and while I crouched behind the holly screen aghast and helplessas one against twoscore or more they looped him by the thumbs andswung him up to dangle from a maple bough a muskets length or such amatter before the cabin doorHe bore the torture patiently as some poor dumb beast suffering at thehand of man and would not part his lips for all the captains cursesBut this was only the merciful beginning With yells of savage fury theIndians carried brands to make a slow fire at his feet and lest thatshould not be enough a brace of them climbed to the roof tore off thesplits for kindling and set the cabin wall alight behind himYou may thank God my dears that you are living in a kindlier ageMayhap the savage now amarch toward the setting sun is still aspitiless as he was but not in any corner of the world I think wouldAngloSaxon men wearing the kings or any other uniform be witnessesunmoved of such a devils carnival of torment as this that made menauseate with horrorAs with the stretching of the cord the wretched black spun slowly roundand round before the growing blaze his cries were something terrible tohear And when the fire light played upon his face it was a sight tofreeze the blood the eyes shut tight against the shriveling heat thecracking lips drawn back the black skin changing to a dry and sicklybrown And ever and anon between the shrieks the parched lips shaped aplea O Massa Massa Capm shoot po nigga and let um dieThis plea for cruel kindness cut me to the marrow of my bones andlacking means to save his life I thought I might at least make shift totry to put him out of miseryThe enemys dispositions favored me The savages drunk with lust ofblood leaped and danced around their victim Falconnet sat his horseapart beneath the maples and with his bodyguard of troopers was wellwithin the borderland of lurid shadow where the fire light mingled withthe nightI crept away and made a swift detour to the right to come behind therearmost horseman of the troop As his ill luck would have it hishorse affrighted at the firelit pandemonium was in the act of wheelingto run away Being cumbered with a musket the man made clumsy work ofhandling his mount and when the beast came down in a snorting trembleto rear afresh at sight of me the man flung away the musket and drewhis swordIn cooler blood I might have given him his soldiers chance but hereagain it was anothers life or mine Even so I might have fought himfair had he but held his tongue and fought in silence But this hewould not so I had to quiet him or have the others about my ears uponhis shoutingsThat done I snatched the musket that had cost the man his life andstaying not to see what should befall ran back to cover In theinterval of weapongetting the fire against the cabin wall had gnawedits way from log to log and now was lapping with its yellow tonguesbeneath the eaves But lest the victim should not suffer long enoughthe Indians were at work in yelling frenzy flogging the blaze withgreen branches broken from the trees so that the fire itself should notbe mercifulI waited till the slowly spinning figure of the black should turn andmake a mark I could not miss The pause gave space for some swiftsteadying of the nerves but with the colder thought it also brought afierce and terrible temptation The finger on the muskets trigger helda life in pawn and I might pick and choose and say what life Id takeI glanced aside at Falconnet He was a fairer mark than my poor Tomasand by the laws of God and man had earned his death The tortured slavehad little time to suffer at the worst and with the bullet that wouldgive him surcease I could well avenge him More than this that bulletplanted in my enemys heart would save my lady Margery harmless leavingme free to go to my own place and so to right the wrong that I had doneAll in the pivoting instant of the pause the musket swung slowly roundas of its own volition and through its sights I saw the slashings goldon red across the breasting of his captains riding coat One littlecrooking of the triggerfinger and the lead had gone upon its errandBut at the balancing instant that piteous cry was lifted once again OMassa Massa Capm God a mussyshoot po nigga and let um dieI did as any other man would do as you have guessed The great kingsmusket swept another arc and roared and belched and spat its messengerof death and my poor Tomas had the boon he prayed forAnd then as if the musket flash and roar had been a lodestone and thesefierce Cherokees so many bits of steel to cluster thick upon it I wassurrounded in the twinkling of an eye and whizzing hatchets and riflebullets whining sibilant were but an earnest of the fate I had invitedXVIN WHICH A HATCHET SINGS A MAN TO SLEEPIn such a coil as this Id looped about me there was nothing for it asit seemed but to draw the steel and die as a soldier should So I brokecover on the forest side of the holly thicket with a yell as fierce astheirs and picked a tree to set my back against and ran for itI never reached the tree In mid career when all the Cherokee wolf packwas bursting through the holly tangle at my heels two men a white manand an Indian ran in ahead as I supposed to cut me off Just then thedry roof of the hunting lodge roared aflame reddening the forest farand near The light was at my back and on the faces of the two who ranto meet me A great sob swelled in my throat and choked me but I ranthe faster For these were my dear lad and the friendly Catawbacharging gallantly to cover my retreatIt was a ready help in time of need They ran in bravely the chiefahead twirling his tomahawk for the throw with Dick a pace to rightand rear his two great pistols brandished and the grandsire of all thebroadswords dangling by a thong at his wristFollow the chief he shouted in passing and at the word the Catawbastopped short sent his hatchet whistling into the yapping pack behindme and swerved to run aside and point the way for meLeft to myself I hope I should have had the grace to stand withJennifer But at the turning point of indecision the quickwitted Indianread my thought and snatching the sword from my hand gave me no choicebut to follow himSo I ran with him but as I fled I looked behind and saw a sight to putthe ancient hero tales to the blush One man against twoscore my braveDick stood while through the underwood the mounted soldiery came tomake the odds still greaterHe never flinched for all the hurtling missiles sent on ahead to cut himdown nor gave a glance aside to where the horsemen were deploying tosurround him As I looked the two great pistols belched in the veryfaces of the nearest Cherokees and in the momentary check the firearmsmade the baskethilted claymore went to work rising and falling like aweavers beamI saw no more but some heartbursting minutes later when Jennifer cameracing on behind to share the flight his heroic stand had made apossibility the swelling sob choked me once again and when I thoughtof what this his rescue of me meant to him I could have blubbered likea boyBut there was little time or space to give remorse an inning TheCherokees checked but for the moment were storming hotly at our heelsAnd as we ran I heard the shouted command of Falconnet to his mountedmen A rescue Right oblique and head them in the road Gallop youdevilsWe ran in Indian file I at the chiefs heels and Jennifer at mine Ifollowed the Catawba blindly and being as yet little better than half aman in breath and muscle was wellnigh spent before we crashed downthrough a tangled briar thicket into the river roadWe were in time but with no fraction of a minute to spare We couldhear the padpadpad of the lightfooted runners close upon usfollowing now by the noise we made and on our left the air wastrembling to the thunder of the mounted men coming at a breakneckgallop down the roadThank God says Richard with a quick eyeshot to right and left in thelesser gloom of the open I was afeard even the chief might miss theplace in the dark Down the bank to the riverquick man andcautious If they smell us out now were no better than buzzardmeatAnd when we reached the waters edge You taught me how to paddle apirogue Jack I hope you havent lost the knack of it yourselfNo said I and the three of us slid the hollowed log into the streamWe were afloat in shortest order holding the canoe against the currentby clinging to the overhanging trees that fringed the bank yet withpaddles poised for a second dash for freedom should the need arise Ishould have dipped forthwith to save the precious minutes but Jenniferstayed meHist he whispered Hold steady and listen They can not see us fromabove mayhap weve thrown them off the scentI thought it most unlikely but his guess was right and mine was wrongThough any of these savages could lift a trail in daylight following itat top speed like a trained bloodhound yet now the darkness baffledthemSo there was some running to and fro in the road above our heads andthen the troopers galloped down Followed hastily a labored confabthrough the linguister broken in the midst by a fury of hot oaths fromFalconnet and then the chase swept on toward the plantations and wewere left to make their losing of us sure by whatsoever means we choseWe paddled slowly up stream in silence keeping well within the blackershadow of the tree fringe When we came opposite the glowing ruins ofthe hunting lodge Jennifer backed upon his paddleYoull go ashore said heI said I would adding They have slaughtered poor old Darius and I amloath to leave his bones for the buzzards to pickHe made no comment other than to swear in sympathy When the piroguegrounded the Indian was out like a cat to vanish phantomwise amongthe trees I followed in some clumsier fashion leaving Jennifer tokeep the canoe but half way up the hill he joined me and would notturn back for all my urging No hang me if Ill let you out ofeyegrip again was all he would say and so we went together and weretogether at the seeing of what the glowing emberheap would show usPoor Tomas had his sepulture already His cord had burned in two and lethim down so close beside the cabin wall that all the blazing debris fromthe overhanging eaves had made his funeral pile Darius lay as I hadlast seen him and him we buried in the maize clearing at the back withthe ember glow for funeral lightsIt was a chanceful thing to do Since the Cherokees had left their deadand wounded and Falconnet the body of his trooper who had yielded methe musket there was small doubt they would return Yet we had time todig a shallow grave for my old henchman to dig and fill it up againand afterward to make a circuit round the burning pile to reach theriver side once moreWhen we had launched the canoe and were afloat and ready for the startthe Catawba was still missingWhere is the chief think you I asked but Dicks answer if indeedhe gave me any was lost in a chorus of ear splitting yells rending thesilence of the night like demon cries Then a single ululation longdrawn and fair blood chilling answered back and Jennifer swept thepirogue stern to strand with a quick paddle strokeThat last was Uncanoolas war cry theyve doubled back in time tocatch him at it he cried Stand by to drive her when I give the wordHere he comesDown the sloping hillside looking in the red glow of the ember heapmore like a flying demon than a man came the Catawba one hand grippingthe scalpingknife the other flung aloft to flaunt his terribletrophies in sight of his pursuers They were so close upon him thatwaiting promised death for all of us so Jennifer dipped again to sendthe canoe a broad jump from the bankReady he cried Hell take the water like a fish and we can pickhim up afterwardNowI heard the cleancut dive of the Indian and struck the paddle deep tobalance Jennifers stroke But as I bent to put my back into it someflying missile caught me fair behind the ear and but for Jennifersquick wit I should have swamped the crazy shallop In a flash he jerkedme flat between his knees and sent the pirogue with a mighty thrustbeyond the zone of fire lightAt that though all the sense was beaten out of me I was alive enoughto hear the savage yells of disappointed rage behind us these and thespitting crackle of a dozen rifles fired at random in the darkness Butafterward all sounds save the rhythmic dip and drip of Jenniferspaddle faded on the sense of hearing till as it would seem thisgentle monody of dipping blade and tinkling drops became a crooninglullaby to blot out all the years that lay between and make me onceagain a little child sinking asleep in my young mothers armsXVIHOW JENNIFER THREW A MAIN WITH DEATHTis a sure mark of healthful sleep that it never makes account of timeNo odds how long the night tis but a moment from the lapse ofconsciousness to its recovery in the morning But this deep sleep thatcrept upon me as I lay in the pirogue listening to the tinkling dripfrom Jennifers paddle was not of healthful weariness and when I cameawake from it there was a dim and troubled vista of vague and brokendreams to measure off the longest night I could ever rememberThe place of this awakening was a burrow in the earth My bed ofbearskins over fragrant pinetufts was spread upon the ground and bythe flickering light of a handful of fire I could see the earth walls ofthe burrow which were worn smooth as if the place had been thewellused den of some wild creature But overhead there was the mark ofhuman occupancy since the eartharch was sooted and blackened with thereek of many firesWhen I stirred there was another stir beyond the handful of fire andJennifer came to kneel beside me taking my hand and chafing it as atenderhearted woman might and asking if I knew himKnow you Why should I not I said wondering why the words took somany breaths betweenO Jack was all I had in answer but when he had found a tongue tobabble out his joy I learned the why and wherefore Once more grimdeath had reached for me lying await in the twirled tomahawk that setme dreaming of my mothers lap and lullaby For a week I had lain hereupon the bed of pinetufts poised upon the brink of the death pit withonly my dear lad to hold and draw me backA week I queried when he had named the interval And you have beenhere all the timeIve never left you save to forage for the pot he admitted I darednot leave you JackBut where are we I would askIn a den on the rivers edge a mile or more above your sacked cabinTis some dodgehole hollowed out by the Catawbas long ago and sharedsince by them and the bears judging from the stinking reek of itUncanoola steered me hither the night of the raidThen the chief came off safely I said falling into a dumb andimpotent rage that the saying of two words should scant me so ofstrength to say a thirdRight as a trivetscalps and all laughed Jennifer Hell be theenvy of every warrior in the tribe when he vaunts himself at theCatawbas council fireI let it rest a while at that casting about for words to shape ahungrier questionHave you no news I asked at lengthLittle or none he answered shortlyBut you have had some wordsome newsfrom Appleby Hundred Istammered feeblyNothing youd care to hear he rejoined evasively I thought Tisas you left it save that Tarleton whipped away to the south again assuddenly as he came and our cursing baronet has made the manor househis headquarters in fact lodging himself and all his troop on MrStair From his lying quiet and keeping the Cherokees in tow there willbe some deviltry afoot Ill warrantI knew that Falconnet was waiting for the powder cargo but anothermatter crowded this asideButbut Margery I queried on sharpest tenterhooks to know how muchor little he had heardI thought his brow darkened at the question but mayhap it was only ashadow cast by the flickering fire At any rate he laughed hardilyShe is welland well content I dare swear Twas only yesterday I sawher taking the air on the river road with Falconnet for an escort Youtold me once he had a sure hand with the women and it made me mad buttruly I have come to think you drew it mild JackNow though I could ply a decent ready blade or keep a firing line fromlurching at a pinch I had not learned to put a snaffle on a blunderingtongue as I have said beforeDamn him as you please Dick and hell warrant it But you must notjudge the lady over harshly nor always by appearances She may haveflouted you as a boyish lover and yet I thinkI stopped in sheer bewilderment shot through and through with keenestagonies of remorseful recollection For at the moment I had clean forgotthe gulf impassable I had set between these two So I would have lapsedinto shamed silence but Jennifer would not suffer itWell what is it that you think he demandedI thinknay I may say I know that she thinks well of you Dick Iblundered on seeing no way to put him offHe gripped my hand and in his eyes there was the light of the old lovereawakeningDont lift me up to fling me down again Jack How can you know whatshe thinks of me he broke in eagerlyI should have told him then all there was to tell He had been thrice mysavior and his heart was soft and malleable on the side of friendshipI knew itknew that the pregnant moment for full confession hadarrived and yet I could not force my tongue to shape the words IndeedI saw more clearly than before that never any word of mine could makehim understand that I was not a faithless traitor in intention So Ipaltered with the truth like any wretched coward of them allYou forget that I have come to know her well I said I was a monthor more under the same roof with her and in that time she told me manythingsNow this witless speech was no better than a whip to flog him onWhat things he questioned promptlyOh many things She spoke often of youWhat did she say of me Jack Tell me what she said he begged Itcan make no difference now she is less than nothing to menaytiseven worse than that since she would play Delilah if she could But ohJack I love herI should love her if I stood on the gallows and shestood by to spring the drop and turn me offTruly if the lash of remorse had lacked its keenest thong thispassionate outburst of his would have added it None the less I mustneeds be weaker than water and fall back another step and put him offAnother time Richard I am strangely unnerved and dizzyheaded now Byand by when I am stronger I will tell you allTaking a reproach where none was meant he sprang up with a selfaimedmalison upon his lack of care for me stirred the fire alive and brewedme a most delicioussmelling cup of broth And afterward when I haddrunk the broth with some small beckonings of returning appetite hespread his coat to screen me from the fire light and would have drivenme to sleep againAt any rate you shall not talk he promised If you are wakeful Iwill talk to you and tell you what little I have gleaned about thefightingHis news was chiefly a later repetition of Father Matthieus and CaptainAbram Forneys but there was this to add the Congress had appointedthe Englishman Horatio Gates chief of the army in the South and thisnew leader was on his way to take commandDe Kalb with the Maryland and Delaware lines and Colonel Armandslegion was encamped on Deep River waiting for the newlyappointedgeneral and Caswell and Griffith Rutherford with the militia werealready pressing forward to some handgrips with my Lord Cornwallis inthe SouthNearer at hand the partizan warfire flamed afresh wherever a Torycompany met a patriot and there were wicked doings more like savagemassacres than fairfought battles of the soldier sortWhen he had made an end of his small war budget I set him on to tell mehow he came to be at hand to help me so in the nick of time on the nightof the cabin sackTwas partly chance he said A redcoat troop had me in durance atJennifer House and while they affected to hold me at parole I nevergave consent to that and so was kept a prisoner They shut me in thewinebin with a guard and when the fellow was well soaked and silly Ibound and gagged him and broke jail I took the river for it meaning tooutlie until the hue and cry was over and just at dusk Uncanooladropped upon me and told me of your need From that to helping him cutyou out of your raffle with the Cherokees was but a hands turn in thedays workA lucky turn for me I said and then at second thought I would denythe saying though not for him to hear But this was dangerous groundagain and I clawed off from it like a desperate mariner tempestdrivenon a lee shore asking him how he had learned the broadsword play andwhere he got the antique claymoreHe laughed heartily and more like my carefree Dick this timeThereby hangs a tale I told you how I was out with the Minute Men in76 at Moores Creek where we fought the Scotchmen It was our firstpitched battle and I opine it smelled somewhat of severity on bothsidesno quarter was asked and the Tory MacDonalds fought like fiendsfor King George small cause as they had to love the House of HanoverHow was that I would ask being as little familiar with the lowcountry settlements as any nativeborn Carolinian could beThey were expatriates for the Pretenders sake many of them MistressFloras husband was one of the prisoners we took But as I was sayingthey were Tories to a man and they fought wickedly When it was overthe prisoners would have fared hardly but for a woman In the thick ofthe fight Mistress Mary Slocumb of Dobbs whose husband was with uscame storming down upon the field having rode agallop some fortyoddmiles because she dreamed her goodman was killed She begged for theprisoners and so Caswell hanged only those who were blood guiltytheseand the house burners A rawboned piper named MGillicuddy fell to mylot and he is now my majordomo at Jennifer House as honest a fellow asever skirled a pibrochThat was like you I said to make a friend and retainer out of yourprisoner And so this Highland piper has been your fencing master hasheTwas he taught me what little I know of the claymore play and thisstout old blade is his Tis as good as a woodmans ax when you have theknack of swinging itTruly said I Also you seemed to have the knack and the strengthas well in spite of the crippled arm you were carrying in a sling thenight before when they haled you into Colonel Tarletons court atApplebyA little ruse of war he said laughing and making a fist to show mehis arm was strong and sound again Twas MGillicuddy put me up to itsaying they would be like to deal the gentler with a wounded man Buthow came you to knowHere was another chance to tell him what he should be told but thewords would not say themselvesI stood within arms reach of you that night said I and from that Ihastened swiftly through the story of my trial as a spy and what it cameto in the morning and never mentioned Margerys part in it at allYou have a bitter enemy in Frank Falconnet was his comment when Ihad made an end of this recounting of my adventures He knows you arein hiding hereabouts and has been scouring the neighborhood well foryouor more belike for both of usHow do you know this I askedI have both seen and heard This den of ours opens on the rivers edgeand two days since his Indians came within an ace of nabbing me Twasjust at dusk and I made out to dodge them by doubling past in thecanoeBut you say you have heard as wellYesHowDont ask me JackI said I had no right to ask more than he chose to tell and at this heblurted out an oath and let me have the sharpedged truthFalconnet has an ally whose wit is shrewder than his Can you guess whoit isNoTis this same Madge Stair you have been defending Jack he saidbitterly It seems that Falconnet made sure we had both gone to jointhe army which was but natural If she were less than the spitefullittle Tory vixen that she is she would have been content to let itrest so But she would not let it rest so With her own lips she assuredFalconnet he still had us to reckon with nay moreshe made a boast ofit that we would never go so far away from herWeak and fevershaken as I was I yet made shift to get upon my elbowfeebly fierce denouncing it hotly for a lieWho slandered her like this Dick Put a name to the cur and as I liveand get my strength again Ill hunt him down and choke him with thatlieNay he objected soberly that would be my quarrel were there ever apeg to hang a quarrel on But it came by a sure hand and one that isfriendly enough to all concerned An old free borderer Ephraim Yeatesby name brought me the tale He had been spying round at ApplebyHundred wanting to know for some purpose of his own why the redcoatsand Cherokees were hanging on so long and this much he overheard onenight when he was outlying under the window of the withdrawingroom Hesays she was in a pretty passion at the baronets slackness stampingher foot at him and lashing him with the taunt that he was afeard of oneor both of usI fell back on the bearskins to shut my eyes and call up all the mightof love to grapple with this fresh misery It was in this fierceconflict of faith against apparent fact that I descried the parting ofthe ways for the lover and the husbandJennifer believed this most incredible thing and yet he lovedherwould go on loving her as he had said in spite of all That wasthe lovers road and I could never bear him company on it Could Ibelieve her so pitiless cruel as this I made sure no husbandlove couldlive beyond that moment of convictionBut at this perilous pass the husbands road ran truer than the loversRichard believed her capable of this hardhearted thing and went onloving her blindly in spite of it But as for me I said I would nevergive belief an inch of standingroom that had I stood in EphraimYeatess shoes having the witness of my own eyes and ears I wouldstill have found excuse and exculpation for herI stole a glance at Jennifer He was sitting with his face in his handsa silent figure of a strong man humbled He had called her a Delilahand the green withes of her binding cut sore into the fleshYou say you love her Dick can you believe her capable of this andyet go on loving her I askedHe let me see his face It was haggard and griefmarredId pay the devils own price could I say no to that Jack But I cannotThen I swear I love her better than you do Richard Jennifer She hatesme wellGod knows she has good cause to hate me fiercely yet I wouldtrust her with my lifeI looked to see him pin me down at this and though the words hadfairly shaped and said themselves I laid fast hold of my courage andwas prepared to make them good But he would only smile and draw thebearskin cover over me tucking me in as tenderly as a mother andsaying very gentlySo she has bewitched you too and now there are two poor fools of loveinstead of one But you are stronger than I Jack You will break thespell and put it down and live beyond it and that I never shallGodhelp me And with that he went to his own bed beside the fire tellingme I must lie quiet and try to sleepI did lie quiet but sleep came not nor did I woo it For long past thetime when I could hear his measured breathing I lay awake to plan how Imight draw the baronets manhunt to myself and so free my loyalRichard of the peril that by rights was mineXVIISHOWING HOW LOVE TOOK TOLL OF FRIENDSHIPFor some few days after Jennifers narrow escape at the entrance to ourhiding place the Cherokees were hot upon our scent quartering theforest on both banks of the river determined as it seemed to hunt orstarve us outIt was in this time of siege that I came to know as I had not knownbefore the depth and tenderness of my dear lads love for me While thelifetide was at its ebb and I was querulous and helpless weak he wasmy leech and nurse and heartening friend in one And later when thetide was fairly turned and I had found my soldiers appetite again hespent many of the nights abroad and never let me guess what risks he ranto fetch me dainties from the outer worldIn this night raiding no danger was too great to hold him back fromserving me Once when we were washing down our evening meal of meat andmaize cake with plain cold water I mourned the good wine idling in itsbin at Jennifer House At that without a word to me he took the wholenight for a perilous adventure and fetched a dozen bottles of theJennifer port to make me choke and strangle at the thought of what itsbringing had cost in toil and hazardAnother time I spoke of English beef saying how it would rebuild a manat needhow it had made the English soldier what he is Whereupon asbefore my loving forager took a hint where none was intended was gonethe night long and slaughtered me some Tory yearlingtwas MrGilbert Stairs I mistrusted though Dick would never name the ownerand so I had a sirloin to my breakfastIn these and many other ways he spent himself freely for love of me Ifhe had been a younger brother of my own blood the common parentage couldnot have made him tendererTwas not the mere outgushing of a nature openarmed to make a bosomfriend of all the world nor any feminine softness on his part If Ihave drawn him thus my pen is but a clumsy quill for he was manlyroughand masterful with all the native strength and vigor of theborderbornBut on the side of love and friendship no woman ever had a truer hearta keener eye or a lighter hand And in a service for friend or mistresshe would spend himself as recklessly as those old knights you read aboutwho made a business of their chivalryWith his daily offerings of unselfishness to shame me you may be surethat I was flayed alive selfflogged like a miserable monk with allthe woundings of the whip well salted by remorse As you have guessedI had not yet summoned up the courage to tell him how I had staked hischance of happiness upon a casting of the die of fatestaked and lostit Now that it was gone I saw how I had missed the golden opportunityhow I had weakly hesitated when delay could only make the tellingharderBy tacit consent we never spoke of Margery Richards silence hung upondespair I thought and as for mine since the husbands road and thelovers lay so far apart I could not bring myself to speak of her Butshe was always first in my thoughts in that time of convalescence as Imade sure she was in his and at the last the hidden thing between uswas brought to lightIt was on a night some three weeks or more after my fever turn Ourlarder had run low again and Jennifer had spent the earlier hours ofthe night abroadto little purpose as it chanced Twas midnight orthereabouts when he came swearing in to tell me that the Tories were outagain to harry our side of the river afresh and to make a refugeesbegging of a bag of meal a thing of perilTheyll starve us out in shortest measure at this rate he prophesiedThey have trampled down all the standing corn for miles around andthis morning they burned the mill Tis our notice to quit and wedbest take it There has been fighting to the south of usa plenty ofitat Rocky Mount and Hanging Rock and elsewhere and every man isneeded If you are strong enough to stand the march well run thegantlet down the river in the pirogue and cut across from the lower fordto join Major Davie or Mr GatesI said I was fit enough and would do whatever he thought best And thenI took a step upon the forbidden groundFalconnet is still at Appleby Hundred I saidHe noddedAnd you will join the army at the front and leave Margery to his tendermerciesHis laugh was bitter so bitter that I scarce knew it for RichardJennifersMistress Margery Stair is well and well content as I told you oncebefore She has no wish for you or me unless it be to see us wellhangedNay Richard you judge her overharshly I fear you do not love her asher lover shouldSay you so Listen tonight I got as far as the manor house beingfool enough to risk my neck for another sight of her God help me JackI had it They have scraped together all the Tory riffraff this side ofthe riverFalconnet and the othersand are holding high revel atAppleby Since it is still our trueblue borderland they are scantenough of women of their own kidney and I saw Madge dancing like anylight o love with every jackanapes that offeredIn her fathers house she could not well do less I averred cut tothe heart as he was and yet without his younger lovers jealousy tomake me unjustOr more he added savagely Tis as I say she lacks nothing we cangive her and wed as well be off about our businessI think he never had it in his heart to leave her in any threat ofdanger But from his point of view there was no danger threatening hersave that which she seemed willing enough to rush upona life of titledmisery as Lady Falconnet I saw how he would see it saw too that hiswas the saner summing of it up And yetHe broke into my musings with a pointed question What say you JackTis but a little whiffet of a Tory jade who cares not the snap of herfinger for either of us The night is fine and dark Shall we float thecanoe and give them all the slipThis was how it came to turn upon a yes or no of mine I hesitatedI know not why In the little pause the fire burned low between us andthe shadows deepened in the burrow cavern until they strangled the eyeas mephitic vapors scant a man of breath The silence too wasstifling There was no sound to breach it save the gurgling murmur ofthe river and this was subdued and intermittent like the deathrattlein the throat of the dyingIve always made a scoff of superstition and yet my dears a thousandquestions in this life of ours must hang answerless to the crack of doomif you deny it standingroom I knew no more than I have set down hereof Margerys besetment nay I had every reason Richard Jennifer had tobelieve that she was well and well content lacking nothing savemayhap the freedom to marry where she choseAnd yet out of the stifling silence there came a sudden cry for help acry voiceless to the outward ear but sharp and piercing to that finerinward sense a cry so real that I would start and listen marvelingthat Jennifer made no sign of having heard itIn the harkening instant there was a faint twang like the thrumming of adistant harp string and then the gravelike silence was rent smartly bythe whistling hiss of an arrow the shaft passing evenly between us andscattering the handful of fire where it struckJennifer came alive with a start leaping up with a malediction betweenhis teeth upon our dallyingToo late by God he cried Theyve trapped us like a pair of blindmoles And with that he caught up the ancient broadsword only to swearagain when he found no room to swing it inHaving the handier weapon I slipped out before him creeping on handsand knees till I could see the leafy screen at the dens mouth and theshimmering reflection of the stars upon the water beyond it There wasno sight nor sound of any enemy and the canoe lay safe as Jennifer hadleft itTo make assurance sure I would have scrambled to the bank above butat the moment Jennifer hallooed softly to me and so I crept back intothe burrowSee here he said excitedly What a devil will you make of thisHe had drawn the scattered embers together fanning them ablaze againand had sought and found the arrow It was a blunthead reed and no warshaft And around the middle of it tightly wrapped and tied with silkenthreads was a little scroll of parchmentTis the Catawbas arrow said Jennifer though how he knew I couldnot guess and then he cut the threads to free the scrollUnrolled and spread at large the parchment proved to be that map ofCaptain Stuarts that I had found and lost again And on the margin ofit was my note to Jennifer written in that trying moment when thebribed sentry waited at the door and my sweet lady stood tremblingbeside me murmuring her Holy MarysRead it said I It explains itself Tarleton had laid me by theheels to wait for the hangman and I would have passed the word aboutthe Indianarming on to you But my messenger was overhauled andYes yes he broke in Ive spelled it out But this line added atthe bottomsurely that is never your crabbed fist By heaven tis inMadges handHe knelt to hold it closer to the flickering firelight and wedeciphered it together It was but a line as he had said with neithergreeting nor leavetaking address nor signatureIf this should come into the hands of any truehearted gentlemanherewas a blot as if the pen had slipped from the fingers holding it andthen in French the very wording of the inarticulate cry that had cometo me out of the darkness and silence A moi pour lamour de DieuWe fell apart each to his own side of the handful of embersYou make it out said I after a moment of strained silenceHe nodded She has prattled the parlezvous to me ever since we wereboy and maid togetherA full minute more of the threatening silence and at the end of it wewere glaring at each other like two wild creatures crouching for thespringIt was Jennifer who spoke first Twas meant for me he said and hisvoice had the warning of a mastiffs growl in itNo said I curtlyI say it wasThen you say the thing which is notHad I been Richard Jennifer I know not what bitter reproach I shouldhave found to hurl at the man who had thrice owed his life to me But hesaid no word of what had gone beforeYou may give me the lie if you like John Ireton I shall not strikeyou He said it slowly but his face was gray with anger Then headded hotly You know well that word was meant for meAt thisGod forgive memy jealous wrath broke bounds and I cursed himfor a beardless coxcomb who must needs think he stood alone in the eyeof every woman he should meet She needs a man I raged lost now toevery sense of decent justice a man I say And to whom would she sendif not to herI choked upon the word He had risen with me and we stood face to facein that grim earthwomb snarling fiercely at each other across thenarrow firelit space two men with every tie to knit us close togetherand yetGod save us alla pair of wild beasts strung up to thekilling pitch because forsooth we must needs front each other across adeadline drawn by the finger of a womanGod knows what would have come of all this had my dear lad been asfierce a fool as I Twas his good common sense that saved us both Ithink for when the savage rival madness was at its height he turnedaway swearing we were the very pick and choice of a world of asses tostand thus feeling for each others throats when mayhap the ladyneeded both of usThis brought me to my senses at a gallop as you would guess to themand to the lighting of the conscience fire within whereon to grill thewicked heart that but now had thirsted for a brothers bloodNow God have mercy on us both I groaned Forgive me Dick if youcan I was as mad as any Bedlamite If I have any claim on her tis notof her good will you may be sure You have the baronet to fearnotmeHe shook his head and pointed to the parchmentto the line in FrenchFrancis Falconnet was under the same roof with heror at least in easycallwhen she wrote that Jack He is no longer my rivalnor yoursHis word set me thinking and I would fall to picking out the strandsthat jealous wrath had woven for me into the web of happenings Settingaside the story brought by Ephraim Yeates there was no certain proofthat she had ever favored the Englishman nay more till I had come tobe madly jealous of Falconnet I had made sure that Jennifer was thefavored oneAt this as one sees a landscape struck out clear and vivid by thelightnings flash I saw the true meaning of the word the hunter hadbroughtsaw it and went upon my knees to grope blindly for the sword Ihad let fall when Dick had found the arrowWhat is it Jack he asked gentlyMy sword I gasped We should have been halfway there by thisYeates was misled Tis Falconnet she fears She was at bayhark youat bay and fair desperate That word of hers to the baronet was her poorpitiful defiance built on her trust in us and we have lain hereHe found the sword and thrust it into my hand cryingCome on You can strew the dust and ashes on me later You said youloved her the better and I do believe it now Jack You trusted her asI did not Well fight as one man to cut her out of this coil whateverit may be and after that is done Ill make my bow and leave you a fairfieldNay nay that you shall not Dick I began but he was halfwaythrough the narrow passage to the open trailing the ancient broadswordand the bearskin from his bed and I was fain to follow quickly leavingthe protest all unfinishedXVIIIIN WHICH WE HEAR NEWS FROM THE SOUTHAs near as might be guessed it wanted yet an hour or two of daybreakwhen we made a landing within the boundaries of Appleby Hundred andbeached and hid the pirogue in the bushesOf the downstream flitting through the small hours of the warmmidsummer night there is no sharpetched picture on the memory page AsI recall it no spoken word of Jennifers or mine came in to break therhythm of the hasting voyage Our paddles rose and fell dipping andsweeping in unison as if we two kneeling in bow and stern wereseparate halves of some relentless mechanism driven by a single impulseOverhead the starlit dome circled solemnly to the right or left to matchthe windings of the stream On each hand the treefringed shores spedbackward in the gloom and beneath the light shell of poplar wood thatbarely kissed the ripples in passing the river lapped and gurgledchuckling weirdly at the paddle plungings and swirling aft in thelonger reaches to point at us down the lengthening wake with a waveringfinger silvertipped in the wan starlightWith the canoe safely hidden at the landing place which was somelittle distance from that oak grove where I had twice kept tryst withdeath we set out for the manor house skulking Indian fashion throughthe wood and when we reached the infields looking momently to comeupon a sentryThinking the approaches from the road and river would be better guardedthan that from the wood we skirted a widespread thicket tangle sparedby my father twenty years before to be a grouse and pheasant cover andfetching a compass of half a mile or more across the maize fields camein among the oaks and hickories of the manor groundsStill there was no sight nor sound of any enemy no light of candles atthe house or of campfires beneath the treesA little way within the grove where the interlacing treetops made thedarkness like Egyptian night Jennifer went on all fours to feel aroundas if in search of something on the sward Whereat I called softly toknow what he would be atHe rose muttering half as to himself I thought Id never be so farout of reckoning Then to me A few hours since the Cherokees wereencamped just here You are standing in the ashes of their fireSo said I Then they have goneGone from this safely enough to be sure They have been gone somehours the cinders are cold and dew wetSo much the better I would say thinking only that now there wouldbe the fewer enemies to fightHe clipt my arm suddenly putting the value of an oath into his grippingof itCome awake man this is no time to be adaze His whisper was a sharpbehest with a shake of the gripped arm for emphasis If the Indiansare gone it means that the powder train has come and gone tooWell said II was still thinking with less than a clods wit that this would sendthe baronet captain about his masters business and so Margery wouldhave surcease of him for a time at least But Jennifer fetched me awakewith another whiplash word or twoJack has the nights work gone to your head If Falconnet has got hismarching orders you may be sure hes tried by hook or crook to playsafe bind safe find with Madge By heaven twas that she was afeardof and we are here too late Come onWith that he faced about and ran and forgetting to loose his grip on myarm took me with him till I broke away to have my sword hand free Sorunning we came presently to the open space before the house andtruly it was well for us that the place was clean deserted for by thiswe had both forgot the very name of prudenceJennifer outran me to the door by half a length and fell to hammeringfiercely on the panel with the pommel of his broadswordOpen Mr Stair open he shouted between the batterings but it wasfive full minutes before the fanlight overhead began to show some faintglimmerings of a candle coming from the rooms beyondRichard rested at that and in the pause a thin voice shrilled fromwithinBe off you runagates Off I say or I fire upon ye through the doorGiving no heed to the threat Dick set up his clamor again calling outhis name and bidding the old man open to a friend In some notching ofthe hubbub I heard the unmistakable click of a gunflint on steel Therewas barely time to trip my reckless batterer and to fall flat with himon the doorstone when a gun went off within and a handful of slugsbreaching the oaken panel at the height of a mans middle wentscreeching over usBefore I knew what he would be at Richard was up with an oath backingoff to hurl himself shoulder on against the door It gave with asplintering crash letting him in headlong I followed less hastily Itwas as black as a setters mouth within the gun fire having snuffed theold mans candle out But we had flint and steel and tinderbox andwhen the punk was alight Jennifer found the candle under foot and gaveit me It took fire with a fizzing like a rocket fuse and was wellblackened with gunpowder When the flint had failed to bring the firingspark the old man had set his piece off with the candle flameWe found him in the nook made by the turn of the stair flung thitheras it seemed by the recoil of the great bellmouthed blunderbuss whichhe was still clutching The fall had partly stunned him but he wasalive enough to protest feebly that he would take a dozen oaths upon hisloyalty to the cause that he had mistook us for some thieving maraudersof the other side craftily leaving cause and party without a name tillhe should have his cue from usWhereupon Richard loosed his neckcloth to give him better breathingspace and bidding me see if the revelers had left a heeltap of wine inany bottle nearer than the wine cellar lifted the old man and proppedhim in the corner of the highbacked hall settleThe wine quest led me to the banquetingroom Here disorder reignedsupreme The table stood as the roisterers had left it the very wreckand litter of a bacchanalian feast Bottles some with the necks struckoff were scattered all about and the floor was stained and sticky withspilt wine and well sanded with shattered glassI found a remnant draining in one of the broken bottles and a cup topour it in and with this salvage from the wreck returned to Jenniferand his charge The old man had come to some better sensing ofthingshe had been vastly more frightened than hurt as Isuspectedand to Richards eager questionings was able to give somefeebly querulous repliesYes theyre goneall gone curse em and theyve taken every plackand bawbee they could lay their thieving hands upon he mumbled Tislike the dogs to stay on here and eat and drink me out of house andhome and then to scurry off when Im most like to need protectionBut Madge says Richard Is she safe in bedShes a jade was all the answer he got Then the old man sat up andpeered around the end of the settle to where I stood cup and bottle inhand Tis a Christian thought he quavered Give me a sup of thewine manI served him and had a Scottish blessing for my wastefulness becauseforsooth the broken bottle spilt a thimbleful in the pouring I saw hedid not recognize me and was well enough content to let it rest thusRichard suffered him to drink in peace but when the cup was empty herenewed his asking for Margery At this the master of the househeartened somewhat by my fathers good madeira made shift to get uponhis feet in some tremulous fashionMadge dye say Shes gone gone where neither you nor that dourfaceddeevil that befooled us all will find her soon I promise you DickieJennifer he snapped and I gave them my back and stumbled blindly tothe door making sure his next word would tell my poor wronged lad allthat he should have learned from never any other lips but mine own ButRichard himself parried the impending stroke of truth sayingSo she is safe and well Mr Stair tis all I ask to knowShe is safe enough safer by far than you are at this minute my youngcockahoop rebel now that the kingGod save himhas his own againI turned quickly on the broad doorstone to look within Out of doorsthe early August dawn was graying mistily overhead but in the house thesputtering tallow dip still struggled feebly with the gloom They stoodfacing each other these two my handsome lad the pick and choice of acomely race looking for all his toils and vigils fresh and fit andthe old man in his woolen dressinggown his wig awry and his lean faceyellow in the candlelightHow is that you say Mr Stair says Dick The kingbut that is onlythe old Tory cry There will never be a king again this side of thewaterThe old man reached out and hooked a lean finger in the ladsbuttonhole Say you so Richard Jennifer Then you will never haveheard the glorious news This with a leer that might have been oftriumph or the mere whetting of gossip eagernessI could not tellNo says Richard with much indifferenceHear it then Twas at Camden four days since They came together inthe murk of the Wednesday morning my Lord Cornwallis and that poor foolGates De Kalb is dead your blethering Irishman Rutherford iscaptured and your ragtag rebel army is scattered to the four windsAnd thats not all On the Friday Colonel Tarleton came up with Sumterat Fishing Creek and caught him napping Whereupon Charlie McDowell andthe overmountain men seeing all was lost broke their camp on theBroad and took to their heels every man jack of them for himself So yesee Dickie Jennifer theres never a cursed corporals guard left ineither Carolina to stand in the kings wayHe rattled all this off glibly like a child repeating some lesson gotby heart but when I would have found a grain of comfort in the hopethat it was a farrago of Falconnets lies Jennifer made the truthappear in answer to a curt questionTis beyond doubtall this Mr StairThe old loyalistloyalist now if never certainly beforesat down onthe settle and laughed a dry wizened cackle of a laugh that soundedlike the crumpling of new parchmentYoud best be off light foot and tight foot Master Richard lest youlearn shrewdly for yourself Tis in everybodys mouth by this Therewere some fiveandforty of the kings friends come together here nolonger ago than yestereen to drink his Majestys health and eh manbut it will cost me a pretty penny Will that satisfy yeYes said Jennifer thinking mayhap as I did that nothing short ofgospeltrue news would have sufficed to unlock this poor old miserswine cellarWell then youd best be off while you may dye hear I bear ye noillwill Richard Jennifer and if Mr Tarleton lays hold of you youllhang higher than Haman for evading your parole I promise you Well saynaught about this rape of the doorlock though tis actionable sirand Ill warn you the law would make you smart finely for it But wellenter a nolle prosequi on that till youre amnestied and back thenyou can pay me the damage of the broken lock and well cry quitsAt this my straightforward Richard snorted in wrathful derision Howevermuch he loved the daughter twas clear he had small regard for thefatherSeeing we came to do you a service Mr Stair I think we may set theblunderbuss and the handful of slugs over against the smashed door Andthat fetches me back to our errand here You say Madge is safe Doesthat mean that you have spirited her away since last nightDinna fash yoursel about Madge Richard Jennifer Shes meat for yourbetters sir rasped the old man lapsing into the mother tongue as hedid now and then in fear or angerStill I would know what you mean when you say she is safe saysRichard whose determination to crack a nut was always proportioned tothe hardness of the shellGilbert Stair cursed him roundly for an impertinent jackanapes and thengave him his answerTis none of your business Dickie Jennifer but you may know and behanged to you She rode home with the Witherbys last night after therout and will be by this safe away in tother Carolina where yourcursed Whiggeries darena lift head or handOf her own free will Dick persistedDamme yes bag baggage serving wench and all Now will you be offabout your business before some spying rascal lays an informationagainst me for harboring youRichard joined me on the doorstone The dawn was in its twilight nowand the great trees on the lawn were taking gray and ghostly shapes inthe dim perspectiveYou heard what he had to say said heI noddedIt seems we have missed our cue on all sides he went on not withoutbitterness I would we might have had a chance to fire a shot or twobefore the ship went downAt Camden you mean Thats but the beginning the real battles are allto be fought yet I should sayHe shook his head despondently You are a newcomer Jack and you knownot how near outworn the country is Gilbert Stair has the right of itwhen he says there will be nothing to stop the redcoats nowI called to mind the resolute little handful under Captain Abram Forneyone of many such he had told me and would not yield the pointThere will be plenty of fighting yet and we must go to bear a handwhere it is needed most said I Where will that be think you AtCharlotteHe looked at me reproachfullyThis time tis you who are the laggard in love John Ireton Will yougo and leave Mistress Margery wanting an answer to her poor little cryfor helpI shrugged What would you Has she not taken her affair into her ownhandsGod knows how much or little she has had to say about it said heBut I mean to know too before I put my name on any company roll Wewere among the trees by this moving off for safetys sake since theday was coming and he broke off short to wheel and face me as one whowould throttle a growling cur before it has a chance to bite We knowthe worst of each other now Jack and we must stand to our compact Letus see her safe beyond peradventure of a doubt then Im with you tofight the redcoats singlehanded if you like I know what you willsaythat the country calls us now more than ever but there must needsbe some little rallying interval after all this disaster andHave done Richard said I Set the pace and mayhap I can keep stepwith you What do you proposeThis that we go to Witherby Hall and get speech with Mistress Madgeif so beStay a moment who are these WitherbysA dyedinthewool Tory family seated some ten miles across the line inYork district True tis a rank Tory hotbed over there and we shallrun some riskNever name risk to me if you love me Richard Jennifer I broke inWhat is your planHis answer was prompt and to the point To press on afoot through theforest till we come to the York settlement then to borrow a pair ofTory horses and ride like gentlemen Are you game for itI hesitated I see no great risk in all this and whatever the hazardtis less for one than for two Youd best go alone RichardHe saw my meaning that I would stand aside and let him be her succor ifshe needed help But he would not have it soNo he said doggedly Well go together and she shall choosebetween us for a champion if she is in the humor to honor either of usThat is what twill come to in the end and I warn you fairly JohnIreton I shall neither give nor take advantage in this strife I saidlast night that I would stand aside but that I can notnot till sheherself says the killing word with her own lipsAnd that word will beThat she loves another man Come let us be at it we should be wellout of this before the plantation people are astirXIXHOW A STUMBLING HORSE BROUGHT TIDINGSHaving a definite thing to do we set about it forthwith taking to thefields and making a wide circuit around the manor house and the quarterswhere the blacks were already stirring to come out to the river and soto cross in our canoeThe morning soft and warm enough threatened now to break the fairweather promise of the starlit night Away in the east a heavy cloudbank curtained off the sunrise and in the fields the few dry maizeblades left by the partizan harriers were whispering to the gustsIn the great forest all was yet dim and shadowy and silent as the gravebut for the whispering murmur of the rising wind in the highertreetops a sound so like the babbling of brooks as most cunningly todeceive the ear and make it set the eye at work to look for water wherethere was noneNot to take a certain hazard for the sake of better speed we shunnedthe road and for the first hour or so were not greatly hindered bykeeping to the forest paths In vast areas this virgin wood was free ofundergrowth open and parklike as a wellkept grove Fireside traditionon the border tells how the Indians kept the forest clear by yearlyburnings of the smaller growth this for the better hunting of the deerI vouch not for the truth of this accounting for the fact but for thefact itself For endless miles between the watercourses these parklikestretches covered hill and dale a vast mysterious temple of Gods ownbuilding its naves and choirs and transepts columned by the countlesstrees with all their leafy crowns to interlace and form the groinedarches overheadThrough these pillared aisles we tramped abreast shunning the road asI have said yet holding it parallel with our course where its directionserved In the open vistas we had frequent glimpses of it winding atfeud with all the points of the compass among the trees But farther onwe came into the lower land of a creek bottom and here a thicksetundergrowth robbed us of any view and made the march a toilsome strugglewith the bushesIt was in the densest of this underwood when we could hear the purringof the stream ahead that Jennifer stopped suddenly and began to sniffthe airSmoke he said briefly in answer to my query A campfire withmeat abroil Never tell me you cant smell itI said I could notdid not at all eventsThen you are not as sharp set for breakfast as I am Call up yourwoodcraft and well stalk it And suiting the action to the word hedropped noiselessly on hands and knees to inch his way cautiously out ofthe thicketI followed at his heels marveling at his skill in threading the mazewith never a snapped twig to betray him For though I have called him ayouthling he came of great squareshouldered English stock and waswell upon fourteen stone for weight Yet upon occasion as now he couldbe as lithe and catlike as an Indian stealthy in approach andtigerstrong to springIn due time our creeping progress brought us out of the thicket on thebrink of the higher creek bank Just here the stream ran in a shallowravine with shelving banks of clay and on its hither margin was a bitof grassy intervale big enough for a horse to roll upon Though it wassadly out of season the carcass of a deer fresh killed hung upon abranch of the nearest tree with a rifle leaning against the trunk as ifto guard it In the middle of the bit of sward a tiny campfire burnedand at the fire squatting with their backs to us and each toasting acut of the deers meat on a forked stick were two menOne of these men would pass by courtesy as a white His huntingshirtand leggings were of deer skin well grimed and greasy with leatherfringes at the seams of leg and sleeve For all the summer heat he worea cap fashioned of raccoonskin with the fur on and for this great caphis irongray hair matted and unkempt served as a fringe to keep theother tasselings in countenance The huntingshirt was belted at thewaist and in the belt was thrust a sheathless knife huge enough toserve a butchers purpose From two leather thongs crossed upon hisshoulders hung the powderhorn and bulletpouch and these with theknife and rifle summed up his accoutrementsThe other was a red man and his attire was simpler Like all oursouthern Indians he went naked to the waist but the savages love ofornament showed forth in the fringe of colored porcupine quills on hisleggings and in his raven hair bestuck with feathers For arms he had anarsenal in his belt two great pistols a tomahawk and thescalpingknife this last smaller than the white mans carving tool butfar more vicious lookingFor a moment or two we crouched irresolute on the brink of the ravineneither of us recognizing the two below Then my young rashling mustneeds let out a yellNow by all thats lucky he cried and would have leaped to his feetBut at the instant the earthedge gave way under him and he was senttumbling with the small landslide of clay down upon the twain at thefireIt went within a trembling hairsbreadth of a tragedy The two at thefire sprang up as one man and the bound that set the hunter afootbrought his long rifle to his shoulder But that the Indian was thequicker Richards life would have paid the penalty of his slip Ithink At the triggerpulling instant the Catawba thrust the thick ofhis hand between stone and steel and the flint bit harmless forJennifer into the palm of the IndianWah he ejaculated in his soft guttural No want kill CaptainJennif heyEphraim Yeates lowered his weapon and released the pinched hand heldfast by the gunflintWell Im daddled fair and square Capn Dick he declared Jest onemore shake of a dead lambs tail and Id a had ye on my mind sartainsure I allowed ye knowed better than to come whammling down thatawaybehint a man whilst hes acooking his vensonDick laughed and called to me to follow as I could And his answer tothe old borderer was no answer at allTis to be hoped you and the chief dont mean to be niddering with thatdeers meat We were guessing but a halfhour back Captain Ireton andI whether or no wed have to take up beltslack for our breakfastAt the word the Catawba whipped out his knife and fell to workhospitably on the meat supply Meanwhile I came upon the scenesomething less hurriedly than Richard Ephraim Yeates looked me up anddown with a sniff for my foreigncut coat another for my queue and athird for the German ritterboots I woreUmph said he Now if here aint that there dadblame Turkeyfighteragain What almighty curis things the good Lord do let loose on astiffnecked and rebellious gineration Then to me most pointedlySay Capn the big woods aint no fitting place for such as you ez Iallow Ye mought be getting them purty boots o yourn all tore up onthe briarsHe ended with a dry little laugh not unlike Mr Gilbert Stairsparchment crackle and being his guest for the nonce I laughed withhimHave your joke and welcome Mr Yeates said I I am too nearfamished to quarrel with my chance of breakfastMuch to my astoundment he flung his raccoonskin cap into the air spatupon his hands and began that insane wardance of hisWhoop he yelled No bandbox dandy from the settlemints ever sot outto call me Mister and got away alive to brag ont Ketch hold youinfergotten Turkeyfighting silverbuttoned jackadandy till I dip yein the creek and soak a flourration r two out n that there pigtailtopknot o yourn YippeeBy this Jennifer was trying as well as a man bent double with laughtermight to interpose in the interest of peace and amity and even thestoical Catawba was all agrin So seeing I was like to losecountenance with all of them I watched my chance and closing with mycapering ancient gave him a hearty wrestlers hugFor all he was so gaunt and thin and full twenty years or more mysenior he was a pretty handful Twas much like trying to catch a fallout of some piece of steelwired mechanism None the less after somewild stampings and strivings in which the old man all but made good hispromise to put me in the creek I took him unawares with a Cornishmanstricka crossbuttock shifted suddenly to a shoulderliftwhich senthim flying overhead to land all abroad in the soft clay of thelandslideThe effect of this little triumph was magical and wholly unlooked forWhen he had gathered himself and set his limbs in order Ephraim Yeatessat up and thrust out a clawlike handPut it there stranger he said I reckon ez how that settles it OldEph Yeatesll share fair powder and lead parched corn and panmeatwith the man that can flop him thataway Whilst yere aneeding afriend in the big woodsa rawmeateating Injunskinner that can jestornarily whop his weight in wildcatswhy old Ephs your man from nowon if not sooner And in this wise began an alliance the like ofwhich for trueblue loyalty on this old borderers part thesecolderhearted times of yours my dears will never seeAs you would guess I gripped the hand of pledging most heartilypulling the old man to his feet and protesting it was but a trick hewould never let another play on him And then we four fell upon thedeers meat which was by this timenot cooked to be sure but seared alittle on the outside in true hunter fashionWhile we ate Richard spoke freely of our intendings and in returnEphraim Yeates was able to confirm Mr Gilbert Stairs war news to theletter For all his Tory bias and prejudice it seemed that Margerysfather had spoken by the book Gates army was crushed and scattered tothe four winds Thomas Sumters freelances had been attacked worstedand driven with the leader himself so sorely wounded that he wascarried from the field in a blanket slung between the horses of two ofhis men and as was to be expected the Tories were up and arming inall the north country Truly the prospect was most gloomy and theoutlook for the patriot cause was to the full as desperate as KingGeorge himself could wishBut you Ephraim and the chief here are you two running away likeall the others Richard would askThe old hunter growled his denial between the mouthfuls of scarcewarmedmeat I reckon ez how tis tother way round were sort o camping onthe redcoats trail ez I allow Aint we Chief heyThe Catawbas assent was a guttural Wah and Ephraim Yeates went on toexplainYe see tis thisaway You took a laugh outn me Capn Dick forspying round on that there Britisher hosscaptain and his redskins butlong toards the last I met up with a thing r two woth knowing Twasa powder and lead cargo they was awaiting for and theyre allowing tosneak it through the mountings to the overhill CherokeesWell says DickThe old man cut another slice of the venison and took his time toimpale it on the forked toasting stickWell then I says to the chief here says I Chief this heres ourAnumberone chance to spile the Gyptians get heap gun heap powderheap lead heap scalp The chief he says Wahwhich is goodInjuntalk for anything ye likeand so here we are hotfoot on thetrail o that there hosscaptain and his powder varmintsAlone said I in sheer amazement at the brazen effrontery of thischase of half a hundred wellarmed men by twoThe old hunter chuckled his dry little laugh We aint sich tarnationbig fools ez we look Capn John Theres a good plenty of em to wallopus ez Ill allow if it come to fighting em fair and square Buttherell be some dark night r other whenst we can slip up on em andraise a scalp r two and lift what plunder we can tote hey ChiefBut now Richard would inquire what time in the night the powder convoyleft Appleby Hundred and if Gilbert Stairs York District guests hadtraveled with it To these askings Yeates made answer that Falconnet andhis troop with the Cherokee contingent had taken the road at midnightor thereabouts and that the Witherbys with Mistress Margery riding herown black mare and her maid on a pillion behind a negro groom hadpassed some two hours laterThis was as we had hoped it might be but when Dicks satisfactionwould have set itself in words the old hunter made a sudden sign forsilence and quickly flung himself full length to lay his ear to theground Whereat we all began likewise to listen but I for one heardnothing till Yeates said A hoss ataking the back track like old Jehuthe son of Nimshi was agiving him the whip and spur and then we allmarked the distant drumming of hoofbeatsThe old borderer sprang afoot kicked the fire into the stream andcaught up his rifle Lets be amoving he said We must make out tostop that there hossgalloper at the ford and find out whatall hes aripsnorting thataway forThe road crossing of the stream was but a little way above our breakfastcamp and we were out of the thicket in time to see the horseman anegro clinging with locked arms to the neck of his mount come tearingdown to the ford At sight of us or else because he would not take thewater at full speed the horse reared pawed the air and fell clumsilycarrying his skilless rider with himWe picked the black up and soused him in the stream till he found histongue and the first wagging of that useful member gave us news to firethe blood in our veinsin Jennifers and mine at any rateYah he screamed choking out the muddy creek water that had wellnighstrangled him Yah red debbil Injins kill ebberybody and tote offMistis Margy and dat Jeanne ooman Dats what dey doneXXIN WHICH WE STRIVE AS MEN TO RUN A RACEIt was some time before the affrighted black could give us any connectedaccount of what had befallen and when at length the story was told allsave the principal fact of the carrying off of Mistress Margery and hermaid was hazy enoughPruned down to the simple statement of the fact and with all thefoolish terror chatterings weeded out his news came to this the partyof homing revelers had been ambushed and waylaid at the fording of acreek some miles to the southward and in the mellay the young mistressand her tirewoman had been capturedSo far as any actual witness of the eye went the negro had seennothing There had been a volley fire from the thicketbelly of blackdarkness a swarming attack to a chorus of Indian yells shouts from themen shrieks from the women confusion worse confounded in which thenewsbearer himself had been unhorsed and trodden under foot After whichhe knew no more till some onehis master as he thoughtkicked himalive and bade him mount and ride posthaste on the backward track toAppleby Hundred crying the news as he went that Mistress Margery Stairand her maid had been kidnapped by the IndiansPinned to the mark and questioned afresh the slave could not affirm ofhis own knowledge that any one had been killed outright Pinned againit proved to be only a guess of his that the one who had given him hisorders was his master In the darkness and confusion he could make sureof nothing had made sure of nothing save his own frenzy of terror andthe wording of the message he carriedWhen we had quizzed him empty we hoisted him upon his beast and sent himonce more agallop on the road to Appleby Hundred That done a hurriedcouncil of war was held in which we four fell apart three against oneJennifer was for instant pursuit afoot and at top speed and EphraimYeates and the Catawba abandoning their own emprise apparently withouta second thought sided indifferently with him For my part I was forgoing back to prepare in decent order for a campaign which shouldpromise something more hopeful than the probability of speedyexhaustion starvation and failureWe grew hot upon it Richard and I he with a young lovers unreckingrashness and I with an old campaigners foresight to make me stubbornand Ephraim Yeates and the Catawba drew aside and let us have it outDick argued angrily that time was the allimportant item and was notabove taunting me bitterly flinging the reproach of coldblooded agein my face and swearing hotly that I knew not so much as the alphabet ofloveThe taunts were passed in silence since I would set them over againstthe irrevocable wrong I had done him saying in my heart that nothing hecould say or do should again tempt me to give place to the devil ofjealous wrathBut when he would give me space I set the hopelessness of pursuit allunprepared as we were in plainest speech The chase might well be along one and we were but scantily armed and without provisions Thehunters rifle must be our sole dependence for food and in the summerheat we would be forced to kill daily On the other hand with horses abag of corn apiece firearms and ammunition we should be in some morehopeful case and notwithstanding the delay in starting could make farbetter speedFor all the good it did I might have spared my pains and saved mybreath Jennifer broke me in the midst crying out that I was even nowkilling the precious minutes and so our illstarred venture had itslaunching in the frenzied haste that seldom makes for speed One smallconcession I wrung out of his impatiencethis with the help of Yeatesand the Catawba We went back to the breakfast camp rekindled the fireand cooked what we could keep and carry of the venisonIn spite of this delay it was yet early in the forenoon of thatmemorable Sunday the twentieth of August when we set our facessouthward and took up the line of march to the ford of the ambushmentBy now the sky was wholly overcast and the wind was blowing fresher inthe treetops but though as yet the storm held off the air was thecooler for the threatened rain and this was truly a blessing since theold hunter put us keen upon our mettle to keep pace with himWe marched in Indian file Ephraim Yeates in the lead Uncanoola at hisheels and the two of us heavierfooted ones bringing up the rearKnowing the wooded wilderness by length and breadth the old man held onthrough thick and thin straight as an arrow to the mark and so we hadnever a sight of the road again till we came out upon it suddenly at theford of violenceHere I should have been in despair for the lack of any intelligible hintto point the way and I think not even Jennifer with all his woodcraftcould have read the record of the onfall as Yeates and the Catawba didBut for all the overlapping tangle of moccasin and hoof prints neitherof these men of the forest was at fault though ten minutes later eventheir skill must have been baffled inasmuch as the first few spittingraindrops were pattering in the treetops when we came upon the groundThats jest about what I was most afeard of said the borderer with ahasty glance skyward Down on your hunkers Chief and help me readthis sign afore the good Lord takes to sending His rain on the jest andthe unjest and therewith these two fell to quartering all the groundlike trained dogs nosing for a scentWe stood aside and watched them Richard and I realizing that we wereof small account and should be until perchance it should come to thelaying on of hearty blows After the closest scrutiny which tookaccount of every broken twig and trampled blade of grass this prolongeduntil the rain was falling smartly to wash out all the footprints inthe dusty road Yeates and the Indian gave over and came to join usunder the sheltering branches of an oakTis a mighty curis sign most mighty curis quoth the hunterslinging the raindrops from his fur cap and emptying the pan of hisrifle not upon the ground as a soldier would but saving everyprecious grain Ez I allow I never heerd tell of any Injuns adoingthataway afore have you Chief heyThe Catawbas negative was his guttural Wah and Ephraim Yeateshaving carefully restored the final grain of the priming to hispowderhorn proceeded to enlighten us at some lengthMighty curis ez I was asaying Them Injuns fixed up an ambushmentblazed in a volley at the clostest sort o range and followed it upwith a tomahawk and knife rushlessen that there Afrikin was too plumbdaddled to tell any truth whatsomedever And spite of all this hererampaging they never drawed a single drop o blood in the wholeenduring scrimmage Mighty curis that aint it now And that aintall some o them same Injuns or leastwise one of em was awearingboots with spurs onto em What say ChiefUncanoola held up all the fingers of one hand and two of the otherSebben Injun one paleface he said in confirmationI looked at Richard and he gave me back the eyeshot with a heartycurse to speed itFalconnet said he by way of tailpiece to the oath and I noddedTwas that there same hosscaptain sure enough ez I reckon drawledYeates Maybe one o you two can tell whatall he mought be adrivingatJennifer shook his head and I too was silent Twas out of all reasonto suppose that the baronet would resort to sheer violence and make aterrified captive of the woman he wanted to marry It was a curiousmystery and the hunters next word involved it still moreAnd yit that aint all Whilst some o the Injuns was awhooping it upacrost the creek achasing the folks that was making tracks for theircity o refuge tothers run the two gals off into the big woods at theside o the road Then Mister HossCaptain picks up the Afrikin chuckshim on a hoss and sends him akiting with his flea in his ear afterwhich he climbs his hoss and makes tracks hisselfnot to ketch upwith the gals ez you mought reckon but off yon way pointing acrossthe creek and down the road to the southwardJennifer heard him through had him set it all out again in plainestfashion and after all could only say You are sure you have thestraight of it EphThe borderer appealed to Uncanoola Come Chief give us the woth ofyour jedgment Has the old Gray Wolf gone stunblind or did he readthem sign like theyd ort to be readWah the Gray Wolf has sharp eyesharp nosesharp tongue sometimeSign no can lie when he read umJennifer turned to me What say you Jack Tis all far enough beyondme Ill confessI was as much at sea touching the mystery as he was yet the thing to doseemed plain enoughNever mind the baronets mystery tis Mistress Margerys hazard thatconcerns us I would say And then to Ephraim Yeates Will this rainkill the trail think youHe shook his head dubiously I dunno for sartain twill make a heap odiffer if they was anyways anxious to hide it Ez it starts out withthe women ahossback tis plain enough for a blind man to lift on therunThen let us be at it said I We can very well afford to let themystery untangle itself as we go And with this the pursuit began inrelentless earnestThe trail of the two horses ridden by Margery and her woman cut a rightangle with the road turning northwest along the left bank of thestream and despite the rain which was now pouring steadily even inthe thick wood the hoofprints were so plainly marked that we couldfollow at a smart dogtrotIn this speeding the old hunter and the Indian easily outweariedJennifer and me They both ran with a slow swinging leap like theracking gait half pace half gallop of a welltrained troop horseMile after mile they put behind them in these swinging bounds and whenwell on in the afternoon we stopped to eat a snack of the cold meat andto slake our thirst at one of the many rain pools I was fain to followJennifers lead throwing myself flat on the soaking mold to pant andgasp and pay off the arrears of breathlessnessThis breathing halt was of the briefest but before the race beganagain Ephraim Yeates took time to make a careful scrutiny of the trailmeasuring the stride of the horses and looking sharply on the briarsfor some bit of cloth or other token of assurance When we came up withhim he was mumbling to himselfUmhm jes so They was amaking tracks along hereaway sartain surelarruping them hosses to a keen jump lickitysplit Now says I tomyself whats the tarnation hurry Aint they got all the time there isto get where theyre agoing immejitly if not sooner Then heturned upon me Capn John cant you and the youngster lay your headsside and side and make out whatall this here hosscaptain mought be upto It do look like he had some sort o hatchet to grind asending thatAfrikin back to raise a hue and cry and then aletting his Injuns leavea trail like this here that any towhead boy from the settlemints couldfollow at a canterRichard said he could never guess the meaning of it all and my mind wasto the full as blank as his I made sure some deeplaid plot was at thebottom of the mystery but we had measured many weary miles in thewilderness and the plotters trap had been fairly baited set andsprung before the lightning flash of explication came to show us allits devilish ingenuityBut now Forward was the word and we fell in line again and againthe tireless running of the two guides stretched and held us on the rackof weariness Happily for us two who were out of training the rainydaydusk came early and though Yeates and the Indian running now withtheir bodies bent double and their noses to the ground held on longafter Richard Jennifer and I were batblind for any seeing of thehoofprints the end came at length and we bivouacked as we werefireless and with the last of the cooked ration of deers meat for ascanty supperAfter the meal which was swallowed hastily in the silence of utterfatigue we scooped a hollow in a last years leaf bed and lay down tosleep wet to the skin as any four halfdrowned water rats and to thefull as miserableFagged as I was twas a long time before sleep came to make me forgeta weary interval fraught with dismal mental miseries to march step andstep with the treadmill rackings of the aching muscles What grievoushap had befallen my dear lady and how much or how little was I to blamefor this kidnapping of her by my relentless enemy Was it a sharpforeboding of some such resort to savage violence that had tortured herinto sending the appeal for helpWith this I fell to dwelling afresh upon the wording of her messagehungering avidly for some hint to give me leave to claim it for my ownThough I made sure she did not love mehad never loved me as otherthan a makeshift confidant whose face and age would set him far beyondthe pale of sentimentyet I had hoped this friendshiplove would giveher leave to call upon me in her hour of needWas I the one to whom her message had been sped Suddenly I rememberedwhat Richard had said that the arrow was the Catawbas If Uncanoolawere the bearer of the parchment he would surely know to whom he hadbeen sentHis burrow in the leaf bed chanced to be next to mine and I could hearhis steady breathing light and longdrawn like that of some wildcreatureas truly he wassleeping with all the senses alert tospring awake at a touch or the snapping of a twig A word would arousehim and a single question might resolve the doubtI thought of all this and yet when I would have wakened the Indian ashaking aguefit of poltroon cowardice gave me pause For while thedoubt remained there was a chance to hope that she had sent to memaking the little cry for help a token not of love perchance but ofsome dawning of forgiveness for my desperate wronging of her And inthat hesitant moment it was borne in upon me that without this slenderchance for hope I should go mad and become a wretched witling at a timewhen every faculty should be superhuman sharp and strong for spending inher serviceSo I forebore to wake the Indian and following out this thought ofservice fitness would force myself to go to sleep and so to gatherfresh strength for the new days measureXXIHOW WE KEPT LENTEN VIGILS IN TRINITYTIDETwould weary you beyond the limit of goodnature were I to try topicture out at large the varied haps and hazards of our wanderings inthe savage wilderness For the actors in any play the trivial detailshave their place and meaning momentous enough it may be yet these areoften wearisome to the box or stall yawning impatiently for the climaxSo if you please you are to conceive us four the strangestillassorted company on the footstool pushing on from day to day deeperand ever deeper into the pathless forest solitudes yet always with theplainmarked trail to guide usAt times the march measured a full days length amid the columned aislesof the forest temple through lush green glades dank and steaming in theAugust heat or over hillsides slippery with the fallen leaves of thepinetrees Anon it traced the crooked windings of some brawlingmountain stream through thicket tangles where you would think nowomanridden horse could penetrateOne day the sun would shine resplendent and all the columned distanceswould fill with soft suffusings of the gray and green and gold withhere and there a dusky flame where the sweetgum heralded the autumnwhilst overhead the leafy arches were finelined traceries andarabesques against the blue But in the night mayhap a dismal rainwould come chill with the breath of the nearing mountains and then thetrees turned into dripping sprinklingpots to drench us where we laysodden already with the heaviness of exhaustionSince the hasting pursuit was a thing to tap the very fountainhead offortitude and endurance we fared on silent for the better part and ina little time the hush of the solitudes laid fast hold of us scantingus of speech and bidding us go softly And after this the march became asoundless shadowflitting and we a straggling file of voicelessmechanisms wound up and set to measure off the miles till famine orexhaustion should thrust a finger in among the wheels and bid them stopforeverThis was the loom on which we wove the backwardreaching web ofstrenuous onpressing But through that web the scarlet thread of famineshuttled in and out and hunger came and marched with us till all thedays and nights were filled with cravings and we recked little of fairskies or dripping clouds or aught besides save this everpresentspecter of starvationYou will not think it strange that I should have but dim and mistymemories of this fainting time Of all privations famine soonest bluntsthe senses making a man oblivious of all save that which drives himonward The happenings that I remember clearest are those which turnedupon some temporary bridging of the hunger gulf One was Yeatesskilling of a milch doe which with her fawn ran across our path when wehad fasted two whole days By this a capital crime in any hunterscode you may guess how cruelly we were nipped in the hunger vise AlsoI remember this as if to mock us all the glades and openings on thehillsides were thicketed with berry bushes long past bearing Andbeing too late for these we were as much too early for the nuts of thehickory and chestnut and black walnut that pelted us in passingThe does meat coming at a time of sharpest need set us two daysfarther on the march and when that was spent or spoiled we did as wecould being never comfortably filled I think and oftener haggard andenfeebled for the want of food Since we dared not stop to go aside forgame the Catawba would set overnight snares for rabbits and foranother shift we cut knobbed sticks for throwing and ran keeneyed alongthe trace alert to murder anything alive and fit to eat In thishaphazard hunting nothing ever fell to Jennifers skilless clubbing orto mine but the old borderer and the Indian were better marksmen andnow and then some bird or squirrel or rabbit sitting on its form came tothe pot though never enough of all or any to more than sharpen thefamine edge of hungerFor all the sharp privations of the forced march there was no hint onany lip of turning back With Margerys desperate need to key us to theunflinching pitch Richard and I would go on while there was strength toset one foot before the other But for the old borderer and the Indianthere was no such bellows to blow the fire of perseverance None theless these two did more than second us they set the strenuous pace andheld us to it the Catawba Spartanproud and uncomplaining the oldhunter no whit less tireless and enduring At this fardistant day I canclose my eyes and see the gaunt leatherclad figure of Ephraim Yeatesstriding on always in the lead and ever pressing forward tough wiryand iron to endure and yet withal so elastic that the shrewdestdiscouragement served only to make him rebound and strike the harderGood stuff and true there was in that old man and had Richard or I beenless determined his fine and noble heroism in a cause which was not hisown would have shamed us into following where he ledWe had been ten days in this starving wilderness driving onward at thepace that kills and making the most of every hour of daylight beforeYeates and the Indian began to give us hope that we were finally closingin upon our quarryThe dragging length of the chase grew upon two conditions From thebeginning the kidnappers were able to increase their lead by stretchingout the days and borrowing from the nights also they were doubtlesswell provisioned and they had horses for the captives and theirimpedimenta But as for us we could follow only while the daylight letus see the trail and though we ran well at first the lack of properfood soon took toll of speedSo now though the hoof prints grew hourly fresher and we were at lastso close upon the heels of the kidnappers that their night campfireswere scarcely cold when we came upon them we ran no longercouldhardly keep a dogged footpace for the hunger pains that griped and bentus doubleThe tenth day as I well remember was furnacehot as were all thefairweather days of that nevertobeforgotten summer with a still airin the forest that hung thick and lifeless like the atmosphere of anoven this though we were well among the mountains and rising higherwith every added mile of westeringThe sun had passed the meridian and we were toiling sweatyweak up arockstrewn mountain side when a thing occurred to rouse us roughlyfrom the famine stupor and set us watchfully alert In the steepest partof the ascent where the wood scanted of rooting ground by the thicklysown strewing of boulders was open and free of undergrowth EphraimYeates halted suddenly signed to us with upflung hand and droppedbehind a tree as one shot and in the same breath the Catawba runningat Yeatess heels lurched aside and vanished as if the earth had gapedand swallowed himA moment later the twang of a bowstring buzzed upon the breathlessnoontide stillness and Jennifer clutched and dragged me down in goodtime to let the arrow whistle harmless over us Then like a distortedecho of the buzzing bowstring the sharp crack of the old borderersrifle rang out smartly setting the cliffcrowned mountain side allaclamor with mocking repetitionsMissed him slick and clean by the eternal coonskin growled themarksman sitting up behind his tree to reload That theres what comeso being so dadblame hongry that ye cant squinch fair atween thegunsights I reckon ez how yed better hunker down and lie clost youtwo Twouldnt sprise me none if that redskin had a wheen more o themsharppinted sticks in hisThe Lord be praised for all His marciesthe chiefs got himBut Uncanoola had not He came in presently his black eyes snappingwith disappointment saying in answer to Yeatess question that the yellhad been his own that his tomahawk had sped no truer than the oldborderers bulletChelakee snake heap slick heap quick dodge was all we could get outof him and when that was said he squatted calmly on a flat stone andfell to work grinding the nick out of the edge of the missped hatchetThis incident told us plainly enough that the kidnappers were now but alittle way ahead and that their rearguard scouts were holding us wellin hand So from that on we went as men whose lives are held in pawn bya hidden foe looking at every turn for an ambushment Nevertheless wewere not waylaid again and when at length the long hot afternoon drewto its close with the mountain of peril well behind us we had neitherseen nor heard aught else of the CherokeesThat night we camped fireless and foodless on the banks of aswiftflowing stream in a valley between two great mountains We reachedthis stream a little before dark and since the trail led straight intothe water we would have put this obstacle behind us if we could Butthough the little river was not above five or six poles in width it wasexceeding swift and deep so impassable in truth that we were moved towonder how the captive party had made shift to crossWe guessed at it a while Richard and I and then gave it up until wemight have the help of better daylight But the old borderers curiositywas not so readily postponed Cutting a slim pole from a saplingthicket he waded in cautiously anchoring himself by the droopingbranches of the willows whilst he prodded and sounded and proved beyonda doubt that the current was over manhead deep and far too rapid forswimmingSatisfied of this he came out dripping and with a monitory word to usto keep a sharp lookout disappeared upstream in the growing dusk hislong rifle at the trail and his body bent to bring his keen old eyesthe nearer to the groundXXIIHOW THE FATES GAVE LARGESS OF DESPAIREphraim Yeates was gone a full hour When he returned he gave us causeto wonder at his lack of caution since he filled his earthen Indianpipe and coolly struck a light wherewith to fire it But when the pipewas aglow he told us of his findingsTwas about ez I reckoned them varmints waded in the shallows a spellto throw us off and then came out and forded higher upThat will be a shrewd guess of yours I take it Ephraim said I forthe night was black as ErebusNeer a guess at all Ive had em fair at eyeholts this as calmly asif we had not been for ten long days pinning our faith to an illdefinedtrace of footprints Ez I was agoing on to say theyre incamped ontother bank ruther eenside o two sights and a hornblow from this Isaw em and counted em seven redskins and the two galsThank God says Richard as fervently as if our rescue of the womenwere already a thing accomplished Then he fell upon the scout with aneager question How does she look Ephraimtell me how she looksListen at him said the old man cackling his dry little laugh Howin tarnation am I going to know which she hes astewing aboutTheres a pair of em and they both look like wimmin ez have beendragged hilterskilter through the big woods for some better n a weekNatheless theyre fitting to set up and take their nourishment both onem They was perching on a log afore the fire with ever lastidintical one o them redskins awaiting on em like they was a coupleof Injun queens I reckon ez how the hosscaptain gave them varmintstheir orders particlarDick was upon his feet lugging out the great broadswordShow us the way Eph Yeates he burst out impatiently We are wastinga deal of precious timeBut the old man only puffed the more placidly at his pipe making nomove to head a sortieFair and easy Capn Dick fair and easy There aint no manner ohurry ez I allow Whenst Ive got to tussle with a wheen o fullredskins and me with my stummick growed fast to my backbone I jest ezsoon wait till them same redskins are asleep Bimeby theyll settledown for the night and then well go up yonder and pizen em immejitlyif not sooner But there aint no kind o use to spile it all byrampaging round too soonThere was wisdom undeniable in this and accordingly we waitedtaking turns at the hunters terrible pipe in lieu of supper and layingour plan of attack This last was simple enough as our resources orrather our lack of them would make it At midnight we would move uponthe enemy feeling our way along the river till we should discover theford by which the captive party had crossed The stream safely passedwe would deploy and surround the camp of the Indians and at the signalwhich was to be the report of Yeatess rifle we were to close in andsmite giving no quarterThe old borderer dwelt at length upon the need for this severity sayingthat a single Cherokee escaping would bring the warriors of the Eratitribe down upon us to cut off all chance of our retreat with the womenOnless Im mightily out o my reckoning this here spot were asettingon aint more than a days Injunrunning from the Tuckasege Towns Withthem gals to hender us we aint agoing to be in no fettle for askimperscamper race with a fresh wheen o the redskins Therefore andwherefore says I make them choppingknives o yourn cut and comeagain even to the dividing erpart of soul and marrerDick laughed and speaking for both of us said between his teeth thatwe were not like to be overmercifulBut now the old wolf of the border gave us a glimpse of an unsuspectedside of him taking Jennifer sharply to task and reading him a homily onthe sin of vengeance for vengeances sake In this harangue he evinceda most astonishing tonguegrasp of Scripture and for a good halfhourthe air was thick with texts And to cap the climax when the sermonpaused he laid his pipe aside doffed his cap and went upon his kneesto pour forth such a militant prayer as brought my fathers stories ofthe grim old fighting Roundheads most vividly to mindHere being as good a place as any I may say frankly that I never fullyunderstood this side of Ephraim Yeates Like all the hardy borderers hewas a fighter by instinct and inclination and I can bear him witnessthat when he smote the Amalekites as he would call themred skin orred coathe smote them hip and thigh and was as ruthless as thatBritish Captain Turnbull who slew the wounded Yet withal on the veryedge of battle or mayhap fair in the midst of it he was like to fallupon his knees to pray most fervently though as I have hinted hisprayers were like his blowsof the biting sort full of Scripturalanathema upon the enemyRichard Jennifer carelessly profane as all men were in that mostgodless day would say twas the old borderers way of swearing thatsince he left out the oaths in common speechas truly he didhewould fetch up the arrears and wipe out the score in one fell blast uponhis knees Be this as it may he was a good man and a true as I havesaid and his warlike supplication that our blades should be as thesword of the Lord and of Gideon in the coming onfall was no whit out ofplaceIt wanted yet a full hour of midnight when Richard began again to pleadpiteously for instant action Yeates thought it still overearly butwhen Jennifer pressed him hard the old borderer left the casting vote tomeWhat say ye Capn John Yourn will be the next oldest head and Ireckon it haint been turned plumb foolish rampaging crazy by this herepurty gal o Gilbert StairsNow you have read thus far in my poor tale to little purpose if you havenot yet discovered the major weakness of an old campaigner which is toweigh and measure all the chances holding it to the full as culpable tostrike too soon as too late This weakness was mine and in that evilmoment I gave my vote for further waiting arguing sapiently that my oldfieldmarshal would never set a night assault afoot till well on towardthe dawnJennifer heard me through and yielded perforce though with littlegoodwillI can not compass it alone or by the gods Id go he assertedangrily Mark you John Ireton this delay is a thing youll rue whilstyou live Your coldcut pros and cons mouth well enough and Im nosoldierlawyer to argue them down But something better than yourdamnable reasons tells me that the hour has struckthat these verypresent seconds are priceless Whereupon he flung himself face down inthe grass and would not speak again until the waiting time was fullyover and Yeates gave the word to fall in line for the advanceHaving learned the lay of the land in his earlier reconnaissance theold borderer shortened the distance for us by guiding us across the neckof a horseshoe bend in the stream and a halfhours blind gropingthrough the forest fetched us out upon the river bank again this timeprecisely opposite the Indians lodge fire on the other sideHere there was a little pause for three of us while Ephraim Yeates creptdown the bank to try with his soundingpole what chance we had ofcrossingMeasured by what could be seen from our covert the narrow width ofquick water seemed the last of the many obstaclesLulled to security as we guessed by the apparent success of their ruseto throw us off the scent six of the Cherokees were lying feet to firelike the spokes of a wheel for which the fitful blaze was the hub Theseventh man was squatted before a small tepeelodge of dressed skinswhich as we took it would be the sleeping quarters of the captivesWhilst all the others lay stiff and stark as if wrapped in soundestsleep this sentry guard too it seemed was scarcely more than halfawake for as we looked his gun was slipping from the hollow of his armand he was nodding to forgetfulnessRichard was acrouch beside me in this peeping reconnaissance and Icould feel him trembling in impatient eagernessIt should be easy enoughwhat think you he whispered and then witha sudden grasp upon my wrist You are cool and steadynerved JohnIreton I swear you do not love her as I doNay I grant you that Dick said I making sure that his excitementwould obscure the double meaning in the admission And then I addedsincerely enough She has never given me the right to love her at allGod help her at this pass he said more to himself than to me andthen he would go in a breath from blessing Margery to cursing EphraimYeates for this fresh delayIt was Uncanoola who broke in upon the muttered maledictionWah Captain Jennif cuss plenty heap like missionary medicinemanLooksee Uncanoola no can find white squaw horse yonder Mebbe CaptainJennif see um heyAt his word we both looked for the horses marking now that they werenowhere to be seen within the circle lighted by the lodge fire TheCatawba grunted his doubt that the enemy was as inalert as he appearedto be then he set the doubt in words Chelakee heap slick Sleep onlyone eye mebbe hey Injun warrior no hide horse and go sleep both eyeon warpathHere our scout came gliding back so noiselessly that he was withinarms reach before we heard him Dick had said I was overcool but theold mans ghostlike reappearance gave me such a start as made me prinkleto my fingers endsHow will it be Eph Dick queried hotly eager to be at work We canmake it across Never say we cant pass that bit of still water manBut Ephraim Yeates did say so in set termsI reckon ez how weve got to cross but not jest hereaway Capn DickShe aint making any fuss about it but shes aslipping along likegreased lightning deep and mighty powerful I aint saying we moughtnt swim her and come out somewheres this side o Danl Boones countrybut well make it a heap quicker by projecing round till we find theford where them varmints made out to crossGod said Dick deep in his throat more time to be killed ByThe old man was parting the bushes to have a better sight of theencampment opposite but at Dicks outbreak he fell back quickly andclapped a hand on the lips of cursingHist Lookee over yonder will ye he cut in And then in a whispermeant for no ear but mine The Lord be marciful to that little galCapn John weve fooled our chance awaythe games afoot and we aintin itI looked and saw nothing save that the sentry guard had risen to throw ahandful of dry branches on the dying fire But on the instant the drywood blazed up and in the wider circle of firelight I saw what thekeener eyes of Ephraim Yeates had descried the sooner In the shadowybackground of the surrounding forest a dozen horsemen were converging inorderly array upon the encampment and at the blazing up of the drybranches their leader gave the command to chargeWhat sham battle there was or was meant to be was over in the briefestspace The troopers galloped in with shouts and aimless pistolingsraising a clamor that was instantly doubled by the yells of the IndiansAs for resistance the charging troop met with nothing worse than theyellings and a scattering fusillade in air Then the ring of horsemennarrowed in to closer quarters and there was some flashing of bare steelin the firelight at which the Cherokee kidnappers melted away andvanished as if by magicWith the shouts and the firing Margery and her maid had burst out of thesleepinglodge to find themselves in the thick of the sham battle andit was but womanlike that they should add their shrieks to the dinbeing as well terrified as they had a right to be But now the leader ofthe attacking troop speedily brought order with a word of command andwhen his men fell back to post themselves as vedettes among the treesthe officer dismounted to uncover courteously and to bow low to theladyThe hosscaptain muttered Ephraim Yeates under his breath but wedid not need his word for it Twas but a childs pebbletoss acrossthe barrier stream and we could both see and hearI give you joy of your escape Mistress Margery said the baronetmouthing his words like a player who had long since conned his lines andgot them well by heart and letterperfect These slippery savages havegiven us a pretty chase I do assure you But you are trembling yetcalm yourself dear lady you are quite safe nowI was watching her intently as he spoke Twas now hard upon two monthssince I had seen her last in that fateful upper room at Appleby Hundredand the intervalor mayhap it was only the hardships and distresses ofthe captive flighthad changed her woefully Yet now as when we hadstood together at the bar of Colonel Tarletons court I saw her passfrom mood to mood in the turning of a leaf her natural terror slippingfrom her like a castoff garment and a sweet dignity coming to clotheher in a queenlier robe making her as I would think more beautifulthan everI thank you Sir Francisfor myself and for poor Jeanne she saidYou have come to take us back to my fatherHe bowed again and spread his hands as a friend willing but helplessUpon my honor my dear lady nothing would give me greater pleasureBut what can I say We are upon the kings business as you well knowand our mission will not brook an hours delayindeed we are hereonly by the good chance which led your captors to choose our route fortheirs I have no alternative but to take you and your woman with us tothe west but I do assure youShe stopped him with an impassioned gesture of dissent and darting adespairing glance around that minded me of some poor hunted thinghopelessly enmeshed in the net of the fowler she clasped her hands andwrung them breaking down piteously at the last and begging him by allthat men hold sacred to send her and her maid back to her father ifonly with a single soldier for a guardTwas then we had to drag my dear lad down and hold him fast else hehad flung himself into the torrent in some mad endeavor to spend hislife for her So I know not in what false phrase the baronet refusedher but when I looked again she was no longer pleading as hissuppliant she was standing before him in the martyr steadfastness of atrue cleanhearted woman at bayThen you will not by so much undo the wrong you have done me CaptainFalconnet she saidA wrong How then do you call it a wrong to rescue you from thesebrutal savages Mistress MargeryShe took a step nearer and though the drystick blaze was dying downand I could no longer see her face distinctly I knew well how thescornful eyes were whipping himListen she said When you set Tallachama and his braves upon us inthe road that night you were not cautious enough Captain Falconnet Isaw and heard you More than that Tallachama and the others have spokenfreely of your plans in their own tongue not knowing that my poorJeanne had been three years a captive among the TelliquosThe attack was so suddensharp and so completely a surprise that he wastaken off his guard else I made sure he would not at such a time havedropped the gentlemanly mask to stand forth the confessed ravisherSo ho Then you have been playing fast and loose with me as you didwith the handsome young planter and that beggarly captain of AustriansTwas a bold game ma petite but you have lost and I have won for mygame was still bolder than yours What I need I take Mistress Madgebe it the body of a woman or the life of a man Savezvous un hommedsespr ma chrie I am that man You pique me and I need the dowryyou will bring If I could have killed your lover out of hand I mighthave been content to leave you for a time Since I could not you gowhere I go and when we return I shall do you the honor to make you LadyFalconnetThe effect of this fierce tirade poured out in a torrent of hot wordswas less marked upon his helpless captive than it was upon her fourwouldbe defenders It moved us variously each after his kindnevertheless I think the same thought lighted instantly upon each ofus Though we might not reach and rescue her her sharpest peril wouldbe blunted upon the quieting of this fiendinchiefSo Ephraim Yeates stretched himself face downward in the damp grass andbrought his long rifle to bear while the Indian sprang up and poisedhis hatchet for the throw but neither lead nor steel was loosed becausethe light was poor and a hairsbreadth swerving of the aim might sparethe man and slay the woman As for the two of us who must needs comewithin stabbing distance the same thought set us both to strippingcoats and footclogs for a plunge into the barrier torrent But when wewould have broken cover the old borderer dropped his weapon and grippedus with a hand for eachNo no none o that he whispered hoarsely Yed drown like ratsand we cant afford no sech foolish sakerfices on the altar o BaalHunker down and lie clost if theres any dying to be done yeve got agood half o the night ahead of ye and theres all o tomorrow thataint teched yetIt takes a pitiless avalanche of words to spread these interlineardoings out for you but you are to conceive that the pause is mine andnot the actions While the old man was yet pulling us down my fearlesslittle lady had drawn back a pace and was giving the villain his answerI am glad I know you now for what you are Captain Falconnet shesaid coldly And then You can take me with you if you choose havingthe brute strength to make good so much of your threat But that isall You can not take for yourself what I have given to anotherCan not you say He clapped his hat on smartly and whistled for hishorseholder and when the man was gone to fetch the mounts for thewomen he finished out the sentence Listen you in your turn MistressSpitfire I shall take what I list and before you see your fathershouse again youll beg me on your knees as other women have to marryyou for very shames sakeIt was then that Uncanoola did the skilfulest bit of jugglery it hasever been my lot to witness Posturing like one of those old Greciandiscusthrowers he sent his scalpingknife handle foremost to glidesnakelike through the grass to stop at Margerys feet Though I thinkshe knew not how it got there she saw it and the courage of the sighthelped her to say quicklyWhen it comes to that sir I shall know how to keep faith with honorHis laugh was the harshest mockery of mirth You will keep faith withme dear lady do you hear OtherwiseHe turned to take the black mare from his man At this my brave one sether foot upon the weapon in the grassI have no faith to keep with you Captain Falconnet she said[Illustration]He struck back viciously Then by heaven youd best make theoccasion It has happened ere this that a lady as dainty as you arehas become a plaything for an Indian camp It lies with me to saveyou from that my MistressShe stooped to gather her skirts for mounting and in the act securedand hid the knife So her answer had in it the fine steadfastness of onewho may make desperate terms with death for honors sakeI thank you for the warning Captain Falconnet she said facing himbravely to the last When the time comes mayhap the dear God will giveme leave to die as my mothers daughter shouldBah said he and with that he whistled for his troopers and while welooked my dear lady and her tirewoman were helped upon their horsesand at the leaders word of command the escort formed upon the captivesas a center A moment later the little glade with the smoldering embersof the lodge fire to prick out its limits in dusky red was empty andon the midnight stillness of the forest the minishing hoofbeats of thehorses came fainter and fainter till the distance swallowed themThen it was that my poor lad faminemad and frenzied rose up to curseme bitterlyNow may all the devils in hell drag you down to everlasting tormentsJohn Ireton for your coldhearted caution that made us lose when we hadgood hope to win he cried One little hour I begged for and thathour had fought her battle and set her free But nowHe broke off in the midst choking with what miserable despair I knewand shared as well and throwing himself down in the wet grass he wouldeke out the bitter words with such ravings and sobbings as bubble up insheer abandonment of rage and miseryXXIIIHOW WE KEPT THE FEAST OF BITTER HERBSYou may be sure that Richard Jennifers bitter reproachings came home tome in sharpest fashion the more since now I saw how we had lost ourchance by neglecting the commonest precautions Having determined toattack the merest novice of a general would have moved his forces tothe nearest point would have had his scouts search out the fordbeforehand and above all would never have delayed the blow beyond theearliest moment of the enemys unwatchfulnessSo now when all was lost I fell to kneading out this sodden dough ofafterwit with Ephraim Yeates but when I sought to carry off the blameas mine by right the old borderer would not give me leaveFair and easy Capn John fair and easy he protested Lets givethat old sarpent which is the devil and Satan his dues Ez I allowthere was the whole enduring passel of us to ricollact all them thingsTo be sure we had our warnings mistrusting all along that this heredadblame hosscaptain had his finger in the pie But lawzee we hadneer a man o God mongst us to rise up and prophesy what was agoingto happen if we didnt get up and scratch gravel immejitly if notsooner though I wont deny that Capn Dick did try his hand thatawayTrue and I would now we had listened to him said I gloomily enoughWe have lost our chance and God knows if we shall ever have anotherFalconnet must have half a hundred men red and white in the powdertrain and by this time he has learned from the Indian who reconnoiteredus on the mountain that we are within striking distance With the enemyforewarned as he is we might as well try to cut the women out of myLord Cornwalliss headquartersThe old man chuckled his dry little laugh though what food formerriment he could find in the hopeless prospect was more than I couldunderstandHo ho Capn John I reckon ez how yere ataking that word fromyonder downhearted boy of ourn Wait a spell till yere ez old ez Ibe then youll never say die till yere plumb deadNow truly though I was dismally disheartened I could reassure him onthe point of perseverance Tis an Ireton failing to lose heart and hopewhen the skies are dark but this is counterbalanced in some of us by acertain quality of unreasoning persistence which will go on running longafter the race is well lost My father had this stubborn virtue to thefull and so had that old Ironside Ireton from whom we are descendedThats the kind o talk was the old mans comment Now well set towork in sureenough arnest Ez I said a spell back my stummick iscrying cupboard till I cant make out to hear my brain asizzling Maybeyou took notice o me apraying down yonder that the good Lorddvouchsafe to give us scalps and provender For our onfaithfulness Hesseed fit to withhold the one but maybe well find a raven r two or awidders mite r mealbarl somewheres in this howling wildernessyitSo saying he summoned the Catawba with a low whistle and whenUncanoola joined us told him to stay with Jennifer whilst we shouldmake another effort to find the fordTheres nobody like an Injun for a nuss when a mans chindeep intotrouble quoth this wise old woodsman when we were feeling our waycautiously along the margin of the swift little river If Capn Dickrips and tears and pulls the grass up by the roots the chiefll onlysay Wah If he sits up and cusses till hes black in the face thechiefll say Ugh And thats just about all a man hankers for whenhis sores arunning in the night season and all Thy waters have goneover his head SelahNow you are to remember the sky was overcast and the night was pitchydark and how the old borderer could read a sign of any sort was farbeyond my comprehension Yet when we had gone a scant halfmile alongthe river brink he stopped short sniffed the air and stooped to feeland grope on the ground like a blind man seeking for something he hadlostRight about hereaway is where they made out to cross he announcedthe whole enduring passel of em ez I reckonour seven varmints andthe hosscaptains powder train Give me the heft o your shoulder tillwe take the water and projec round a spell on tother sideWe squared ourselves wholly by the sense of touch with the riversedge locked arms for the better bracing against the swift current andso essayed the ford It was no more than thigh deep and though thewater lashed and foamed over the shoal like a torrent in flood therewas a clean bottom and good footing Once safe across we turned ourfaces downstream and in a little time came to the deserted glade withthe embers of the kidnappers fire glowing dully in the midstHere a sign of some later visitants than Falconnets horsemen set uswarily on our guard The tepeelodge of dressed skins which had beenleft undisturbed by the sham rescuers had vanishedUmph The redskins have been back to make sure o what they leftbehind said Yeates in a whisper I jing thats jest the one thing Iwas ahoping theyd forget to do I reckon ez how that spiles our lastliving chance o finding anything that mought help slack off on thebellypinchSo he said but for this once his wisdom was at fault and tricky fortunefavored us When we had found the covert in the bushes where the twohorses had been concealed we lighted upon a precious prize Twas a bagof parched corn in the grain some share of the provision of the captiveparty overlooked by those who had returned to gather up the leavingsWith this treasuretrove we made all haste to rejoin our companions Andnow behold what a miracle of reanimation may be wrought by a fewhandfuls of bread grain In a trice the Catawba had found a waterwornstone to serve for a mortar and another for a pestle These and the bagof corn were carried back to a sheltered ravine which we had crossed onour late advance and here the Indian fell to work to grind the corninto coarse meal whilst Yeates and I kindled a fire to heat thebakingstonesIn these preparations for the breaking of our long fast even Richardbestirred himself to help and when the cakes were baked and eatenwithwhat zestful sharpsauce of appetite none but the famished may everknowwe were all in better heart and better able to face the new andfar more desperate plight in which our lack of common foresight hadentangled usFor now since we knew the full measure of the peril menacing our dearlady there was need for swift determination and a blow as swift andsure a coup de main which should atone in one shrewd push for thesleeveless failure of the night So we would grip hands around even tothe stolid Indian and swear a solemn oath to cut the women out or elseto leave our bones to whiten in the forest wildernessYoull laugh at all these vowings and handstrikings I dare say andprotest there was a deal of such fustian heroics in your doddering oldchroniclers dayMayhap there was But my dears I would you might remember as you laughthat we of that simplehearted elder time lived by some halfcenturynearer to that age of chivalry you dote onin the storybooks Also Iwould you might mingle with your merriment a little of the saving graceof charity letting it hint that perchance these you call heroicswere but the free untrammeled folkspeech of that sincerer naturalheart which you have learned to silence and suppress For I dare affirmthat now as then and always there will be some spark of the Prometheanfire in every heart of man or maid else this would indeed be a sorryworld to live inSo as I say we four struck hands anew on the desperate venture andafter carefully burying the fire to the end that it might not betray uswhile we slept we burrowed in the nearest leaf bed to snatch an houror two of rest before the toils and hazards of the chase should beginafreshIn the thick darkness following hard upon the douting of the fire I sawnot who my nearest bedfellow might be But ere I slept a hand was laidon my shoulder and a voice that I knew well said Are you waking yetJackI said I was and at that my poor lad would blurt out all his sorrow andshame for the mad fit of despair that had set him on to rail and cursemeYou will say with good reason that I am but a sorry jockey for afriendto fly out at you like a madman as I did he added by way offitting epilogue and to this I gave him the answer he wished biddinghim never let a thought of it spoil him of the rest he neededThe debt of obligation and forgiveness is all upon the other side asyou will some day know Dick my lad said I hovering as a cowardalways will upon the innuendoedge of the confession he will nevermakeHe mistook the pointing of this protest as he was bound toNever say that Jack Twould be a doginthemanger trick in me toblame you for loving her And since you speak of debts I do protest Iowe you somewhat too With so fair a chance to cut a clean swath inthat fairweather month at Appleby Hundred another man would have leftme scant gleanings in the field Ill be bound whereasDamn you I broke in roughly will you never have done and go tosleep And so taking surly harshness for a mask when my heart was nighbursting with shame and grief I turned my back and cut him offXXIVHOW WE FOUND THE SUNKEN VALLEYLooking back upon the hazards and chancetakings of our adventure in thewilderness I recall no more promising risk than that we ran by sleepingunsentried within rifleshot for aught we knew of the camp of theenemyBut touching this tis only on the mimic stage of the romances that theplayers rise to the plane of superhuman sagacity and angelwit neverfaltering in their lines nor betraying by slip or tonguetrip theirkinship with common humankind Being mere mortals we were not soendowed we were but four outwearied men well spent in the long chasewith never a leg among us fit to pace a sentry beat nor a decent wakefuleye to keep it company So as I have said we took the risk and sleptwould have slept as soundly I dare say had the risk been twice asgreatWe were astir at the earliest graying of the dawn Richard and I andwere the laggards of the company at that since the old hunter wasalready out and away and the Indian had kindled a fire and wasgrinding more of the parched corn for the morning meal Dick sat up inhis leaf litter yawning like a sleepy giantLord Jack said he if ever we win out of this coil with a full dayto spare I mean to sleep the clock hands twice around at a stretch Ipromise you Twas but a catch this catnap no more than enough toleave a bad taste in the mouthAye but the taste may be washed out said I I am for a dip in theriver what say youHe took me at the word and we had an eyeopening plunge in thespringcold flood of the swift little river at the mouth of our ravineTwas most marvelous refreshing and with appetites sharp set andwhetted by the stripping and plunging we were back at the fire in timeto give good day to Ephraim Yeates at that moment returned with thehindquarters of a fine yearling buck freshkilled across hisshouldersSeeing the deers meat we would think the old hunters thrift of thedawn sufficiently accounted for but when the cuts were abroil we weremade to know that the buck was merely a lucky incident in the earlymorning scoutingTaking time by the forelock the old borderer had swept a circle ofreconnaissance around our halting place to get the pints of thecompass as he would say His first discovery was that the ford we hadfound in the darkness served as the river crossing of an ancient andwellused Indian trace Along this trace from the eastward the powdertrain had come no longer ago than midafternoon of yesterday andarguing from this that the night camp of the band would be but a shortmarch to the westward Yeates had pushed on to feel out the enemyspositionFor a mile or more beyond the ford he had trailed the convoy easily TheIndian trace or path welltrampled by the numerous horses of thecavalcade followed the upstream windings of the swift river straightinto the eye of the western mountains But in the eye itself a rockydefile where the slopes on each hand became frowning battlements tonarrow valley and stream the one to a darkling gorge the other to athundering torrent the trail was lost as completely as if the powderconvoy had vanished into thin airHere was a fresh complication and one that called for instant actionWe had counted upon a battle royal in any attempt to rescue the womenbut that Falconnet impeded as he was by the slow movements of thepowder cargo could slip away was a contingency for which we werewholly unpreparedSo as you would guess the hunter breakfast was hurriedly despatchedand by the time the sun was shoulder high over the eastern hills we hadbroken camp and crossed the river and were pressing forward to thegorge of disappearanceOn each hand the mountains rose precipitous the one on the leftswelling unbroken to a bald and rounded summit forest covered save forits tonsured head high in air while that on the right was steeper andlower with a line of cliffs at the top As we fared on the valleynarrowed to a mere chasm with the river thundering along the base ofthe tonsured mountain and the Indian path hugging the cliff on therightIn the gloomiest depths of this defile we came upon the huntersstumblingblock A tributary stream issuing from a low cavern in therighthand cliff crossed the Indian path and the chasm at a bound andplunged noisily into the flood of the larger river On the hither sideof this barrier stream the trail of the powder convoy led plainly downinto the water and so far as one might see that was the end of itAs we made sure we left no stone unturned in the effort to solve themystery No horse ridden or led could have lived to cross the pouringtorrent of the main river or to wade up or down its bed and if thecavalcade had turned up the barrier stream its progress must have endedabruptly against the sheer wall of the cliff at the entrance to thelowarched cavern whence the tributary came into being But if Falconnetand his following had ridden neither up nor down the bed of the barrierstream it seemed equally certain that no horse of the troop had crossedit The Indian trace which held straight on up the gorge and presentlycame out above into a high upland valley was unmarked by any hoofprint new or oldWell now Ill be daddled if this here aint about the beatinestthing I ever chugged up aginst was the old borderers comment whenwe had flogged our wits to small purpose in the search for some clue tothe mystery Whats your mind about it hey ChiefUncanoola shook his head Heap plenty slick No go upstream no godown no cross over no go back Mebbe go up like smokewatThe hunter shook his head and would by no means admit the alternativeEz I allow that would ax for a merricle and I reckon ez how when thegood Lord sends a chariot o fire after sech a clanjamfrey as thisn othe hosscaptains itll be mighty dadblame apt to go down stead ofupWe were standing on the brink of the barrier stream no more than afishermans cast from the black rockmouth that spewed it up from itsunderground maw While the hunter was speaking the Catawba had lapsedinto statuelike listlessness his gaze fixed upon the eddying floodwhich held the secret of the vanished cavalcade Suddenly he came alivewith a bound and made a quick dash into the water What he retrieved wasonly a small piece of wood charred at one end But Ephraim Yeatescaught at it eagerlyNow the Lord be praised for all His marcies he exclaimed It do takean Injun to come arunning whenst everbody else is plumb beat outNeer another one of us had an eye sharp enough to ketch that bit osign afloating past What say Capn JohnI shook my head seeing no special significance in the token and Dickasked What will it be Ephraim now that it is caughtThe old man looked his pity for our dullard wit and then set a moietyof it in wordsWell well now Im fair ashamed of ye What all dye reckon blackenedthe end o this bit o pinebranchWhy fire says Richard beginning as I did to see some glimmeringof lightIn course And it come from yonder didnt it pointing to the cavernunder the cliff More than that twas cut wi a hatchetthis freshend of itno longer ago than last night at the furdest the pitch thatthe fire fried outn it is all soft and gummy yit Gentlemen allwhenst we find where this here creek comes out into daylight again wereagoing to find the hosscaptain and the whole enduring passel oredskins and redcoats immejitly if not soonerWhat comment this startling announcement would have evoked I know notfor at the moment of its utterance the Catawba went flat upon theground making most urgent signs for us to do likewise What he had seenwe all saw a flitting instant later the painted face of a Cherokeewarrior as a setting for a pair of fierce basilisk eyes peering out ofthe lowarched cavern whence the stream issued an apparition lookingfor all the world like a dismembered head floating on the surface of theoutgushing floodTwas the old borderer who took the initiative in the swift retreatand we followed his lead like welldrilled soldiers A crook in thestream and the thickset underwood screened us for the moment from thebasilisk eyes and in a twinkling we had rolled one after another intothe mimic torrent and were quickly swept down to its mouthHere death lay in wait for us in the mad plungings of the main riverbut we made shift to catch at the overhanging branches of the willows inpassing to draw ourselves out to scramble up the gorge and to gain agreat boulder on the mountain side whence we could look down upon thescene of our late surprisalBy this we saw from the wings as it were the setting of the stage fora tragedy which might have been ours One by one a score of heads withpainted faces floated silently out of the spewing rockmouth One by onethe glistening bronzered bodies appertaining thereto emerged from thewater each to take its place in an ambuscade enclosing thestreamcrossing of the Indian path in a pocketlike line of crouchingfigures with the mouth of the pocket open toward the lower valleyEphraim Yeates chuckled under his breath and smote softly upon histhighThey tell ez how the good Lord has a mighty tender care for chillernand simples he whispered Whenst we was acoming arampaging up thetrace a hour r two ago I saw the moccasin track o that there spy andwas too dadblame biggity in my own consate to ax what it mought meanWhat spy says Dick matching the hunters low whisperWhy the varmint that tracked me back from here twixt dawn anddaybreak to be sure He waited till we broke camp and then took outup here ahead of us to tell his chief twas eenamost time to set thetrap for three white simples and a red one Friends Im atelling yeplain that the sperrits amoving me mighty powerful to get down on myhunkers andFor heavens sake dont do it here and now gasped Dick Lets getout of this spidersweb while we mayThe old hunter postponed his prayerful motion most reluctantly as itwould seem and led the way in a silent withdrawal from the dangerousneighborhood of the ambushment When we had pushed on somewhat higher upthe gorge and stood on the confines of the upland valley for which itserved as the approach there was a halt for a council of warSince it was now evident that the powder convoy was encamped in somehidden gorge or valley to which the cavern of the underground stream wasone of the approaches twas plain that we must climb to some heightwhence we could command a wider viewWe were all agreed that the cavern entrance could not have been used bythe entire company this though the conclusion left the vanishing trailan unsolved riddle For if the women could have been dragged throughthe lowspringing arch of the waterway we knew the horses could nottosay nothing of the certain destruction of the powder cargo in such apassageSo we addressed ourselves to the ascent of the northern mountain thoughRichard and I would first beg a little space in which to drain the waterfrom our boots and to wring some pounds weight of it from our clothesThat done we fell in line once more and being so fortunate as to hitupon a ravine which led to the cliffcrowned summit the climb was shornof half its toil and difficulty Nevertheless by the suns height itwas well on in the forenoon before we came out perspiring like sappersin a steam bath upon the mountain topAs Yeates had guessed this northern mountain proved to be a loftytableland So far as could be seen the summit was an undulating plainless densely forested than the valley but with a thick sprinkling ofpines to make the still hot air heavy with their resinous fragrance Asit chanced our ravine of ascent headed well back from the cliff edgeso we must needs fetch a compass through the pine groves before we couldwin out to any commanding point of viewThe old borderer took his bearings by the sun and laid the coursequartering to bring us out as near as might be on the heights above thegorge But when we had gone a little way a thinning of the wood aheadwarned us that we were approaching some nearer break in the tablelandFive minutes later we four stood on the brink of a precipice lookingabroad upon one of natures most singular caprices Conceive if you cana segment of the tableland in shape like a broadbilged man o warsunk to a depth of mayhap six or seven hundred feet below the generallevel of the plateau Give this shipshaped chasm a longer dimension oftwo miles or more and a breadth of somewhat less than half its lengthbound it with a walllike line of cliffs falling sheer to steepforested slopes below prick out a silver ribbon of a stream windingthrough grassy savannas and wellset groves of lordly trees from end toend of the sunken valley and you will have some picture of the scene welooked uponBut what concerned us most was a sight to make us crouch quickly lestsharp eyes below should descry us on the skyline of the cliff Pitchedon one of the grassy savannas by the stream so fairly beneath us thatthe smallest cannon planted on our cliff could have dropped a shot intoit was the camp of the powder trainXXVHOW UNCANOOLA TRAPPED THE GREAT BEARTwas Richard Jennifer who first broke the noontide silence of themountain top voicing the query which was thrusting sharp at all of usNow how in the name of all the fiends did they make shift to burrowfrom yonder bagbottom into this he would sayEz I allow thats jest what the good Lord fotched us here forto findout was Yeatess rejoinder Do you and the chief Capn Johncircumambylate this here pitfall yon way whilst Capn Dick and I gotother way round By time weve made the circuit and jined companyagain I reckon well know for sartain whether r no they climm themounting to get inSo when we had breathed us a little the circuiting was begun EphraimYeates and Jennifer going toward the lower end of the sink and theCatawba and I in the opposite directionSince we must examine closely every rift and crevice in the boundarycliff it was a most tedious undertaking and I do remember how my greattrooper boots sundrying on my feet made every step a wincing agonyThey say an army goes upon its belly but an old campaigner will tellyou that you can march a soldier till he be too thin to cast a shadow ifonly he hath ease of his footgearTaking it all in all it proved a slow business this looping of thesunken valley and when we had worked around to the eastern cliff and toa meeting point with the old hunter and Richard Jennifer the sun waslevel in our faces and the day was waningComing together again we made haste to compare notes There was littleenough to add to the common fund of information and the mystery of thelost trail remained a mystery True we the Indian and I had found aravine at the extreme upper end of the valley through which we thoughta surefooted horse might be led at a pinch up or down but this ravinehad not been used by the powder train and apart from it there was nopracticable horse path leading down from the plateauAs for the hunter and Richard they had made a discovery which mightstand for what it was worth At its lower extremity the sunken valleywas separated from the great gorge without only by a ridge which was nomore than a huge dam and this diking ridge was evidently tunneled bythe stream since the latter had no visible outletInasmuch as the most favorable point of espial upon the camp below wasthe cliff whence we had first looked down into the sink we harked backthither passing around the lower end of the valley and along thebarrier ridge Plan we had none as yet for the preliminary to anyattempt at a rescue must be some better knowledge of the way into andout of Falconnets cunningly chosen stronghold True we might win inand out again by the ravine which the chief and I had explored at theupper end and Dick was for trying this when the night should give usthe curtain of darkness for a shield But the old hunter would hold thisforlorn hope in reserve as a last resortSort it out for yourself Capn Dick he argued Whatsomedever wemake out to dofour on us aginst that there whole enduring army otheirnhas got to be done on the keen jump with a tolerble plainhossroad for the skimperscamper race when it is done For lookingit up and down and side to side weve got to have hossessome o theirhosses at that I jing if we could jest make out somehow r other tolay our claws on the beasteses aforehandWe had reached the cliff and were once more peering down at the enemyscamp Though for the cliffshadowed valley it was long past sunset andall the depths were blue and purple in the changing halflights of thehour the shadow veil was but a gauze of color softening the detailswithout obscuring them So we could mark well the metes and bounds ofthe camp and prick in all the itemsThe camp field was the largest of the savannas or natural clearings Onthe margin of the stream the Indian lodges were pitched in a semicircleto face the water Farther back Falconnets troop was hutted inroughandready shelters made of pine boughsthese disposed to standbetween the camp of the Cherokees and the tepeelodge of the captivewomen which stood among the trees in that edge of the forest hemming theslope which buttressed our cliff of observationAt first we sought in vain for the storingplace of the powder It wasthe sharp eyes of the Catawba that finally descried it A rude housingof pine boughs like the huts of the troopers had been built at thebase of a great boulder on the opposite bank of the stream and here wasthe lading of the powder trainFrom what could be seen twas clear that the camp was no mere bivouacfor the day indeed the Englishmen were still working upon theirpinebough shelters building themselves in as if for a stay indefiniteTis a rest camp quoth Dick though why they should break the marchhere is more than I can guessNo said Ephraim Yeates Taint jest rightly a rest camp ez I takeit Ez I was asaying last night this here is Tuckasege country and weaint no furder than a days running from the Cowee Towns Now theTuckaseges and the overmounting Cherokees aint always on the best otarms and I was a wondering if the hosscaptain hadnt sot down here towait whilst he could send a peaceoffer o powder and lead on to theCowee chiefs to sort o smooth the wayNo send him yet going to send was Uncanoolas amendment LookseeChelakee braves make haste for load horses down yonder nowAgain the sharp eyes of the Catawba had come in play At the foot of thegreat boulder some half dozen of the Cherokees were busy with the powdercargo lashing packloads of it upon two horses One of the group whoappeared to be directing the labor of the others stood apart holdingthe bridle reins of three other horses caparisoned as for a journeyWhen the loading was accomplished to the satisfaction of thehorseholding chieftain he and two others mounted took the burdenedanimals in tow and the small cavalcade filed off down the stream towardthe apparent cul de sac at the lower end of the valleyEphraim Yeates was up in a twinkling dragging us back from the cliffedgeUp with ye he cried Nows our chance to kill two patridges withone stone If we can make out to get down into tother valley in time tosee how them varmints come out well know the way in Moren that wecan ambush em and so make sartain sure o five o the six hosses wereagoing to need come night But weve got to leg for it like Ahimaazthe son of ZadokThus the old borderer and being only too eager to come to handgripswith the enemy we were up and running faster than ever Joabsmessenger ran long before the old man finished with his ScripturalsimileNot to take the risk of delay on any unexplored short cut we madestraight for the ravine of our ascent found it as by unerring instinctand were presently racing down to the Indian trace in the little uplandvalley above the gorgeFor all the helterskelter haste I found time to remember that the gorgeas we had last seen it had been well besprinkled with armed Cherokeeslying in wait for us If they were still there we should be like to havea hot welcome and some reminder of this I gasped out to Yeates in midflightNem mind that if we run up aginst em anywhere twont bethereaway Theyve took the hint and quit scattered out to hunt uslong ago was his answer jerked out between bounds And after that Iloosed the Ferara in its sheath and saved my breath as I might for thekilling business of the momentTwas a sharp disappointment that for all the haste of our mad scrambledown the mountain we were too late to surprise the secret of theenemys stronghold The Catawba was leading when we dashed down into thevalley and one glance sent him flying back to stop us short with a dumbshow purporting that the quarry was already out of the defile and comingup the Indian pathRichard swore grievously but the old backwoodsman took the checkmateplacidly and began to set the pieces for the second game in which thehorses were the stake hiding his useless rifle in a hollow treehispowder had been soaked and spoiled in the early morning plunge forlifeand drawing his huntingknife to feel its edge and pointEz I allow that fotches us to the hosslifting he said in his slowdrawl Then he laid his commands upon us Ordly and in sojerfashionnow no whooping and yelling If the hosscaptains got scouts outasarching for us one good screech from these here varmints wereagoing to put outn their misry ud fix our flints for kingdom comeI aint none afeard o your nervethis to Richard and meleastwisenot when it comes to fair and square sojerfighting But this hereonfall has got to be like the smiting o the Malekitesroot andbranch and if yere tempted to be anywise marciful jest ricollect thatfor the sake o them wimmenfolks weve got to have these hossesYou are not to suppose that he was holding us inactive while he thusexhorted us On the contrary he was posting us skilfully beside thetrace like the shrewd old Indian fighter that he was with a rare andpractised eye to the maximum of cover with the minimum of thicket tangleto impede the rush or to shorten the swordswingBut when all was done we were at this disadvantage that since the enemywas close at hand we dared not cross the path to give our trap a jaw oneither side To offset this the Catawba dropped out of line anddisappeared and when the Cherokees were no more than a hundred yardsaway Uncanoola came in sight a like distance in the opposite directionrunning easily down the path to meet the upcoming ridersRichard let slip an admirationoath under his breath Theres a finebit of strategy for you he whispered That wily Jackatapinch ofours will befool them into believing that he is a runner from the CoweeTowns Tis our cue to lie close he will halt them just here and therewill be roving eyes in the heads of the two who have not to talkWe had not long to wait Our cunning ally timed his halting of theemissaries to a nicety and when the three Cherokees drew rein they werewithin easy blades reach The powwow lengthened by Uncanoola till wewere near bursting with impatience was spun out wordily and presentlywe saw the pointing of it The Catawba was affecting to doubt theprotests of the emissaries and would have them dismount and prove theirgood faith by smoking the peacepipe with himI give you fair warning my dears that you may turn the page here andskip what follows if you are fain to be tenderhearted on the score ofthese savage enemies of ours It was in the very summer solstice of theyear of violence a time when he who took the sword was like to perishwith the sword and we thought of little save that Margery and herhandmaiden were in deadliest peril and that these Indians had fivehorses which we must haveAnd as for my own part in the fray when I recognized in thefivefeathered chieftain of the three that copperhued imp of Satan whohad been the merciless master of ceremonies at the torturing of my poorblack Tomas the decent meed of mercy which even a seasoned soldier maycherish died within me and I made sure the steel would find its markSo when Uncanoola drew forth his tobacco pipe and made the three doomedones sit with him in the path to smoke the peacewhiff all around wepicked out each his man and smote to slay The scythelike sweep ofJennifers mighty claymore left the fivefeathered chieftain the shorterby a head in the same pulsebeat that the Ferara scanted a second of thebreath to yell with though now I recall it the gurgling deathcry ofthe poor wretch with the steel in his throat was more terrible to hearthan any warwhoop As for the old borderer he was more deliberateBeing fair behind and within arms reach of his man he seized him bythe scalplock bent the head backward across his kneebut faughthese are the merest butcher details and I would spare youand myselfas wellWhile yet this most merciless deed was adoing the Catawba bounded tohis feet and made sure of the horses which were rearing and snortingwith affright That done he must needs gloat Indianwise over hisfallen adversary turning the headless body with his foot and gibing atitWah Call hisself the Great Bear hey Heap lie heap no bear heapnothing now Papoose bear no let hisself be trap that way No smokepeacepipeBut now Ephraim Yeates standing ear acock and motionless like somegrim old statue done in leather cut him short with a sudden Histwill ye and a twinkling instant later we had other work to doOnto the hosses with this here Injunmeat ez quick ez the lovingLordll let ye was the sharp command Theres a whole clanjamfrey othe varmints acoming down the trace and I reckon ez how wed betterscratch gravel immejitly if not soonerXXVIWE TAKE THE CHARRED STICK FOR A GUIDELuckily for us the new danger was approaching from the westward So bydint of the maddest hurryings we got the bodies of the three Cherokeeshoist upon the horses and were able to efface in part the signs of thelate encounter before the band of riders coming down the Indian path wasupon us But there was no time to make an orderly retreat At most wecould only withdraw a little way into the wood halting when we werewell in cover and hastily stripping coats and waistcoats to muffle theheads of the horsesSo you are to conceive us waiting with nerves upstrung ready for fightor flight as the event should decide stifling in such pentup suspenseas any or all of us would gladly have exchanged for the fiercest battleHappily the breathscanting interval was short From behind our thicketscreen we presently saw a file of Indian horsemen riding at a leisurelyfootpace down the path Ephraim Yeates quickly named these newcomersfor usTis about ez I allowedsome o the Tuckaseges ascouting down tohold a powwow with the hosscaptain Now then if them sharpnosedponies o theirn dont happen to sniff the bloodThe hope was dashed on the instant by the sudden snorting and shying oftwo or three of the horses in passing and we laid hold of our weaponskeying ourselves to the fighting pitch But curiously enough theriders made no move to pry into the cause So far from it they floggedthe shying ponies into line and rode on stolidly and thus in a littletime that danger was overpast and the evening silence of the mightyforest was ours to keep or break as we choseThe old frontiersman was the first to speakWell friends I reckon ez how we mought ez well thank the good Lordfor all His marcies afore we go any furder he would say and he doffedhis cap and did it forthwithIt was as grim a picture as any limner of the weird could wish to lookupon The twilight shadows were empurpling the mountains and gatheringin dusky pools here and there where the trees stood thickest in thevalley The hush of natures mystic hour was abroad and even theswiftly flowing river rushing sullenly along its rocky bed no more thana stones cast beyond the Indian path seemed to pretermit its lowthunderings There was never a breath of air astir in all the wood andthe leaves of the silver poplar that will twinkle and ripple in thelightest zephyr hung stark and motionlessBarring the old borderer who had gone upon his knees we stood as wewere the Catawba holding the pack horses and Jennifer and I the threethat bore the ghastly burdens of mortality The bodies of the slain hadbeen flung across the saddles to balance as they might and to thepommel of that saddle which bore the trunk of the fivefeatheredchieftain Uncanoola had knotted the grisly head by its scalplock todangle and roll about with every restless movement of the horseahideous deathmask that seemed to mop and mow and stare fearsomely at uswith its wideopen glassy eyesWith this background fit for the staging of a scene in Dante Alighieristragic comedy the looming mountains the upper air graying on to duskand the solemn forest aisles full of lurking shadows you are to picturethe old frontiersman bareheaded and on his knees pouring forth hissoul in all the sonorous phrase of Holy Writ now in thanksgiving andnow in most terrible beseechings that all the vials of Heavens wrathmight be poured out upon our enemiesHis face commonly a leather mask to hide the man behind it was nowablaze with the fire of zealotry and truly in these his spasmfits ofsupplication he stood for all that is most aweinspiring and unnervingasking but a little stretch of the imagination to figure him as one ofthose old ironhard prophets of denunciation come back to earth to bethe herald of the wrath of GodTwas close upon actual nightfall when the old man rose from his kneesand with the rising put off the beadsman and put on the shrewd oldIndian fighter Followed some hurried counselings as to how we shouldproceed and in these the hunter set the pace for us as his age and vastexperience in woodcraft gave him leaveHis plan had all the merit of simplicity Now that we had the horsesRichards notion of an approach from the head of the sunken valleybecame at once the most hopeful of any So Ephraim Yeates proposed thatwe betake ourselves to the mountain top and to the head of that ravinewhich the Catawba and I had discovered Here we should leave the horseswell hidden and secured make our way down the ravine and with thestream for a guide follow the sunken valley to the camp at its lowerend Once on the ground without having given the alarm we might hope tofree the captives under cover of the darkness and our retreat up thevalley would be far less hazardous than any open flight by way of theunexplored road the powder train had usedSo said the old backwoodsman but neither Dick nor I would agree to thisin toto Dick argued that while we were killing time in the roundaboutadvance we should be leaving Margery wholly at the mercy of the baronetand that every hour of delay was full of hideous menace to her Hence heproposed that three of us should carry out the hunters plan leavingthe fourth to take the hint given by the charred stick and the swimmingambush crew and so penetrating to the valley by the stream cavern beat hand to strike a blow for our dear ladys honor in case of needTis a thing to be done and I am with you Dick said I This beforeEphraim Yeates could object Should there be need for any two bladeswill be better than one If it come to blows and we are killed or takenYeates and the chief must make the shift to do without our helpAs you would guess the old hunter demurred to this halving of ourslender force but we overpersuaded him If all went well we were torendezvous on the scene of action to carry out the plan of rescue Butif our adventure should prove disastrous Yeates and Uncanoola were tobide their time striking in when and how they mightTouching this contingency I drew the old man aside for a word inprivateIf aught befall us Ephraimif we should be nabbed as we are like tobeyou are not to let any hope of helping us lessen by a feathersweight the rescue chance of the women Youll promise me thisSartain sure ye can rest easy on that Capn John But dont ye go forto let that rampaging boy of ourn upsot the fat in the fire with any ohis foolishness Hes lovesick he is and there aint nothing in thisworld so ridiclous foolish ez a lovesick boylessn tis a lovesickgalI promised on my part and so we went our separate ways in the gatheringdarkness though not until the lashings of the packs had been cut andthe powder and lead save such spoil of both as Ephraim Yeates andUncanoola would reserve had been spilled into the river As for thebodies of the dead Indians the old hunter said he would let them ridetill he should come to some convenient chasm for a sepulcher but Imistrusted that he and the Catawba would scalp and leave them once wewere safely out of sightAt the parting we took the rivers edge for it Richard and I keepingwell under the bank and working our way cautiously down the gorge untilwe were stopped by the pouring crosstorrent of the undergroundtributary Here we turned short to the left along the margin of thebarrier stream and tracing its course across the gorge came presentlyto the northern cliff at the lip of the spewing cavern mouthBy now the night was fully come and in the wooded defile we could placeourselves only by the sense of touchAre you ready Dick said IAs ready as a man with a shaking ague can be he gritted out Thisdogs work we have been doing of late has brought my old curse upon meand I am like to rattle my teeth looseLet me go alone then Another cold plunge may be the death of youNo said he stubbornly Wait but a minute and the fever will be onme then I shall be fightingfit for anything that comesSo we waited and I could hear his teeth clicking like castanetsHaving had a tertian fever more than once in the Turkish campaigning Ihad a fellowfeeling for the poor lad knowing well how the thought of aplunge into cold water would make him shrinkIn a little time he felt for my hand and grasped itIm warm enough now in all conscience he said and with that weslipped into the streamTwas a disappointment of the grateful sort to find the water no morethan midthigh deep The current was swift and strong but with thepebbly bottom to give good footing twas possible to stem it slowlyLaying hold of each other for the better breasting of the flood we feltour way warily to the middle of the pool felt for the lowsprung cavernarch and for that scanty lifting of it where we hoped to find head roombetween stone above and stream belowWe found the highest part of the arch after some blind groping andmaking lowly obeisance to the gods of the underworld began a snaillikeprogress into the gurgling throat of the spewing rockmonsterI here confess to you my dears that had I loved my sweet lady lessno earthly power could have driven me into that dismal stifling placeAll my life long I have had a most unspeakable horror of lowroofedcaverns and squeezing passages that cramp a man for breath and for theroom to draw it in and when the suffocating madness came upon me asit did when we were well jammed in this cursed horrorhole I was rightglad to have my love for Margery to make an outwardseeming man of meglad too that my dear lad was close behind to shame me into going onYet after all the passage through the throat of the rock dragon wasvastly more terrifying than difficult Once well within the closelydrawn upper lip we could brace our backs against the roof and so have apurchase for the foothold Better still when we had passed apikeslength beyond the lip the breathing space above the water grewwider and higher till at length we could stand erect and come abreast tolock arms and push on side by sideFrom that the stream broadened and grew shallower with every step andpresently we could hear it on ahead babbling over the stones like anypeaceful woodland brook Then suddenly the dank and noisome air of thecavern gave place to the pinescented breath of the forest and lookingstraight up we could see the twinkling stars shining down upon us froma narrow breadth of skyXXVIIHOW A KINGS TROOPER BECAME A WASTRELDick pressed closer to me and I could feel him drinking in deep draftsof the grateful outer airWhat new wonder is this he would ask with something akin to awe inhis voice but we must needs grope this way and that to feel out theanswer with our fingertipsWhen the answer was found the mystery of the lost trail was solved mostsimply As we made out we were in a deep crevice cut crosswise by thestream which issuing from a yawning cavern in the farther wall wasquickly engulfed again by that lower archway we had just traversed Insome upheaval of the earthquake age a huge slice of the mountains facehad split off and settled away from the parent cliff to leave a deepcleft open to the sky One end of this crevice chasmthat toward theupland valleywas choked and filled by the debris of later landslidesbut the lower end was openThrough this lower end as we made no doubt the powder train had cometurning from the Indian path in the gorge up the bed of the barrierstream turning again at the outer cavern mouth to squeeze in singlefile between the thickly matted undergrowth and the cliffs face and soto pass around the splitoff mass and come into the crevice riftHow the sharp eyes of the old hunter and those of the Catawba as wellhad missed the finding of this squeezing place where the cavalcade hadleft the streambed we could never guess but on the chance that wemight yet need to know all the crooks and turnings of this outlet wefelt our way quite around the masking cliff and down to the streamsedge in the gorgeThat done we were ready for a farther advance and clambering back intothe crevice we once more took the stream for our guide and werepresently deep in the natural tunnel piercing the mountain proper Thisextension of the subterranean waterway proved to be a noble cavern wideand high enough to pass a loaded wain as we determined by tossingpebbles against the arching roof None the less twas full of crooksand windings and in the sharpest elbow of them all where we were liketo lose our way by blundering into one of the many branching sidepassages Richard stopped me with a hand thrust backSoftly he cautioned here are their vedettesJust beyond the crooking elbow the dull red glow from a tiny fire goneto coals showed us two Indian sentries set to keep the pass Dick drewhis claymore but he was chilling again and the hand that grasped thegreat blade was shaking as with a palsy Yet he would mutter as theteethchattering suffered himWhat say you Jack Shall we rush them Theres naught else for itAnd then with a gritting oath Oh damn this cursed chillingI whispered back that we would wait till he was better fit He was loathto admit the necessity but as it chanced the momentary delay savedour lives in that strait While we paused hugging the shadows in thecrooking elbow the gloomy depths beyond the sentries were suddenlystarred with flaring flambeaux lighting the way for a hasting rabble ofsavages and had we been entangled in the struggle with the twosentinels we should have been taken redhandedAs it was we had to make the quickest play to save ourselves In thesame breath we both remembered the narrow side passage just behind inwhich we were nigh to losing our way and into this we plunged recklessof possible pitfalls We were no more than safely out of the maincorridor when the runners some score of them as we guessed troopedpast our covert in full cry leaving us half smothered in the smokytrail of their pitchpine flambeauxNow what adevil has set this hornets nest of theirs abuzz sosuddenly I whispered when the smokechoke gave us liberty to speakwithout coughing to betray ourselvesOur ponyriding Tuckaseges doubtless was Richards ready answer Byall the chances they should have met the Great Bear and hispeaceoffering out yonder on the tracewhich same they did not Sowhen they bring this tale to camp there is the devil to pay and no pitchhot God help our tough old Ephraim and the Catawba if these bloodhoundswin out in time to overtake themAye said I and then we crept out of our dodgehole and made ready togo about our business with the sentriesBut when we came to peer again around the crooking elbow it would seemthat the hurrying search party had fought our battle for us Thewatchfire was there to light a little circle in the gloom but thewatchers were gone We chanced a guess that they had joined the hue andcry and so we pressed forward past the handful of embers and into thepitblack depths beyondTwenty paces farther on it came to playing blind mans buff with therocky walls again and measured by the trippings and stumblings twas along Sabbath days journey to that final turn in the great earthburrowwhence we could see the glimmering of the enemys campfires in thesunken valleyNow God be praised quoth Richard most fervently Another hour inthis cursed kennel with the fever on me and I should be a yammeringloosewit And I too was glad enough to see the stars again and tobe at large beneath themEmerging from the subterranean way we held to the camp side of thestream making an ample circuit to the left to come down upon theenemys position from the wooded slope behind the encampment We met nolet or hindrance in this approach Secure in their stronghold theIndians had no patrols out and as for the Englishmen every mothersson of them it seemed was basking in the light of a great fire builtbefore the pinebough sheltersFavored by a dense thicketing of laurel we made a nearhandreconnaissance of the little wigwam which held our dear lady As I havesaid this was pitched in the thinning of the forest which covered thesteep slope behind the encampment and so was the farthest removed fromthe stream and from the Indian lodges disposed in a halfmoon at thewaters edge Here all was quiet as the grave and the clamor of theIndian camp came softened by the distance to a low monotonous humminglike the buzzing of a beehive The flap of the tepeelodge was closelydrawn and the bit of fire before it had burned out to a heap ofwhiteashed embersThey are safe as yet thank God says Richard heaving a most palpablesigh of relief Then with the fever in his veins to whip his naturalardor into hasty action Twill be hours before Eph and the Catawba cancome in by your upper ravine Jack and we shall never have a betterchance than this Hold you quiet here whilst IBut I laid fast hold of him and would not hear to any such a foolhardymarring of Ephraim Yeatess planHeavens boy are you gone clean mad I would say Twill be riskyenough with midnight in our favor with the camp well asleep and thatgreat fire burned down to give us something less than broad daylight towork inHe turned upon me like a pettish child Oh to the devil with yourstumblingblocks John Ireton You are always for holding back Byheaven Ill swear you have no drop of lovers blood in your veinsSo you have said before But let that pass we must bide by our promiseto Yeates which was not to interfere unless Margery stood in presentperil Moreover we should learn the lay of the land better while wehave the firelight to help When the time for action comes we must beable to make the play with our eyes shut if need be ComeTwas like pulling sound teeth to get him away but he yielded at lengthand we crept on to have some better sight of the troop camp We had ithad also a glimpse of the baronetcaptain playing loo with hislieutenant and another The tableau at the fire gave us better courageThe men had laid their arms aside and were sprawling at their ease andwhile the arch scoundrel was in the gaming mood Margery had less tofear from himI said as much to Dick and for answer he pointed to the flask ofusquebaugh which was at that moment making the round of the loo playersI know Frank Falconnet better than you do Jack for I have known himlater He is all kinds of a villain sober but he is a fiend incarnatewith the liquor in him Tis lucky we are here If he do but drink deepenough Margery is like to have needHist said I some of these lounging rascals may not be so drowsy asthey lookHe nodded and we backed away to make another circuit which fetched usout on the upvalley side of the encampment Here we could look downinto a smaller glade or bottom meadow on the stream where the horses ofthe band were cropping the lush grass It was the sight of these and ofMargerys black mare among them that set me thinking of a pickeeringventure to the full as harebrained as that from which I had but nowdissuaded Richard JenniferWe shall need another mount and Mistress Margerys saddle I saidLie you close here whilst I play the horsethief on these reaversBut my dear lad was rash only for himself Now who is daft heretorted The Catawba himself could never run that gantlet and comethrough aliveMayhap I admitted But yetHe cut me off in the midst winding an arm about my head by way of anextinguisher One of the redcoat troopers lounging before the great firehad risen and was coming straight for our hiding placeI saw not what to do should have done nothing I dare say till the manhad walked fair upon us But Richard was quicker wittedGive me your sword he muttered mine will be too long to shortenupon and when the Englishmans next stride would have kicked us out ofhiding Dick rose up before him like the devil in a play gripped him bythe collar and laid his swords point at his throatFollow me step for step or you are a dead man he commanded and sopacing backward he led the fellow with the hulking body of him for ashield and mask out of the circle of firelight and into the safershadows of the forestWhen I had made a creeping detour to join him he still had his man bythe collar and was emphasizing the need for silence by sundry prickingswith the FeraraSay quick what to do with him Jack he demanded when I came upand now my slower wit came into playOut of this to some safer dressingroom and Ill show you said Iand forthwith we marched our prize up the valley a long musketshot ormoreWhen the soldier had leave to speak he begged right lustily for hislife as you would guess but we gave him a short shrift If the plan Ihad in mind should have a fighting chance for success it must be set intrain before this trooper should be missedSo having first gagged the poor devil with his own neckerchief westripped him quickly and I as quickly donned the borrowed uniform andbecame at least in outward semblance a lighthorse trooper of thatking whose service I had once forsworn The items of smallclotheswaistcoat and headgear fitted me passing well but when it came to theboots we stuck fast and I was forced to wear my own footcoveringsThe change madeand you may believe no playhouse actor of them allever doffed or donned a costume quickerwe bound our luckless captivehand and foot pinned him face downward in the sward and so leaving himwith only his boots for a mementohappily for him the night was nomore than gooseflesh coolwe raced back to our peepingplace on theskirting of the camp groundHere Dick wrung my hand calling himself all the knaves unspeakable forletting me take a risk which he was pleased to call his own and withthat I stepped out into the firelight and was fair afoot in the enemyscampXXVIIIIN WHICH I SADDLE THE BLACK MAREHaving so good a disguise the thing I had set myself to do would seemto ask for little more than peaceful boldness held in check by commoncautionThe point where I had broken cover to step into the circle of fire lightwas nearly equidistant from the Englishmens camp on the right and thehorse meadow on the left so I had not to pass within recognition rangeof the great fire indeed I might have skulked in the laurel cover allthe way thus coming to the horses unseen by any but that I was afraidFalconnet might miss his trooper So I thought it best to show myselfdiscreetlyCopying our captives lounging stride I first held a sauntering coursedown to the streams edge keeping the great campfire and the droningIndian hive well to the right and far enough aloof to baffle anyovercurious eye at either Coming to the stream without mishap Istopped and made a feint of drinking after which I crossed and climbedslowly toward the makeshift powder magazineAs I have said the camp was pitched in a small savanna or naturalclearing on the right bank of the little river This clearing washedged about by the forest on three sides and backed by the denselywooded steeps and crags of the western cliff I guessed the compass ofit to be something more than an acre not greatly more since the fireat the troop camp lighted all its boundariesOn the left or opposite bank of the stream there was no intervale atall The ground rose sharply from the waters edge in a rough hillsidethickly studded and bestrewn with boulders great and small fallencleavings and hewings from the crags of the eastern cliff Twas at thefoot of one of the boulders a huge overhanging mass of weatherrivenrock facing the camp that the powder cargo was sheltered so isolatedto be out of danger from the campfiresFrom the hillside just below this powder rock I could look back upon thecamp en enfilade as an artilleryman would say Nearest at hand wasthe halfmoon of Indian lodges with the hollow of the crescent facingthe stream and a caldron fire burning in the midst Around the fire aring of warriors naked to the breechclout kept time in a slow shufflingdance to a monotonous chanting and for onlookers there was an outerring of squatting figuresthe visiting Tuckaseges as I supposedBeyond the Indian lodges and a little higher up the gentle slope of thesavanna were the troop shelters and beyond these half concealed inthe fringing of the boundary forest was the tepeelodge of the womenOn the bare hillside beneath the powder magazine I made no doubt I wasin plainest view from the great fire and the proof of this conclusioncame shortly in a bellowing hail from FalconnetHo Jack Warden he called making a speakingtrumpet of his hands tolift the hail above the chanting of the Indian dancers Have a look atthat shelter whilst you are over there and make sure twill shed rain ifthe weather shiftsNow some such longrange marking down as this was what I had beenangling for So I came to attention and saluted in soldierly fashionthereby raising a great laugh among my pseudocomrades around thetrooper firea laugh that pointed shrewdly to the baronetcaptainslack of proper discipline But that is neither here nor there Having mymasters order for it I climbed to the foot of the powder rockHere the bare sight of all the storedup devastation set me athirst witha fierce longing for leave to snap a pistol in the welllaid mine Forif these enemies of ours had planned their own undoing they could neverhave given a desperate foeman a better chance To hold the pine boughsof the rude shelter in place they had piled a great loose wall of stonesaround and over the cargo and the firing of the powder heaped as itwas against the backing cliff of the boulder would hurl these weightingstones in a murderous broadside upon the camp across the streamBut since my dear lady would also share the hazard of such a broadsideI had no leave to blow myself and the powder convoy to kingdom come asI thirsted tocould not you will say having neither pistol to snapnor flint and steel to fire a train Nay nay my dears I would nothave you think so lightly of my invention Had this been the onlyobstacle you may be sure I should have found a way to grind a firingspark out of two bits of stoneBut being otherwise enjoined as I say I turned my back upon thetemptation and held to the business in hand which was to reach andrecross the stream higher up and so to come among the horsesAs I had hoped to find them the saddles were hung upon the branches ofthe nearest trees Margerys horsefurnishings among them At first theblack mare was shy of me but a gentling word or two won her over andshe let me take her by the forelock and lead her deeper into the herdwhere I could saddle and bridle her in greater safetyMy plan to cut her out was simple enough Trusting to the darknessthehorse meadow was far enough from the fires to make a murky twilight ofthe ruddy glowI thought to lead the mare quietly away up the streamand thus on to the foot of that ravine by which we hoped to climb to theold borderers rendezvous on the plateau But when all was ready and Isought to set this plan in action an unforeseen obstacle barred theway To keep the horses from straying up the valley an Indian sentryline was strung above the grazing meadow and into this I blundered likeany unlicked knave of a raw recruitHad I been armed the warrior who rose before me phantomlike in thelaurel edging of the meadow would have had a most sharppointed answerto his challenge As it wasI had left my sword with Jennifer becausethe captured trooper whose understudy I was had left his sword incampI tried to parley with the sentry He knew no word of Englishnor I of Cherokee but that deadlock was speedily broken A gutturalcall summoned others of the horsekeepers and among them one who spokea little EnglishUgh What for take white squaw horse he demandedTis the captains order I replied lying boldly to fit the crisisAt that they gave me room and had I hastened I had doubtless gone atlarge without more ado But at this very apex point of hazard I mustneeds play out the part of unalarm to the fools envoi taking time topart the mares forelock under the headstall and looking leisurely tothe lacings of the saddlegirthThis foolhardy delay cost me all and more than all I was stillfiddlefaddling with the girth strap the better to impose upon myIndian horseguards when suddenly there arose a yelling hubbub oflaughter in the camp behind I turned to look and beheld a thinglaughable enough no doubt and yet it broke no bubble of mirth in meHalfway from the nearest forest fringe to the great fire a man whiteof skin and clothed only in a pair of trooper boots was runningswiftly for cover to the nearest pinebough shelter shouting like anescaped Bedlamite as he fled It asked for no second glance thisapparition of the yelling madman twas our captive soldier footlooseand racing in to raise the hue and cryNow you may always count upon this failing in a cautious man that at acrisis he is like to do the unwisest thing that offers This cutting outof Margerys mare was none so vital a matter that I should have riskedthe marring of Ephraim Yeatess plan upon it Yet having done this verything I must needs make a bad matter infinitely worseInstead of mounting to ride a charge through the camp and so to drawthe pursuit after me toward the cavern entrance as I should I slappedthe mare to send her bounding through the guard line snatched a saddlefrom its oakbranch peg to hurl it in the faces of the sentry group anddarting aside plunged into the laurel thicket to come by running whereI could and creeping where I must to that place where I had left RichardJenniferAll hot and exasperated as I was twas something less than cooling tofind Dick adouble on the ground holding his sides and laughing like ayokel at his first pantomimeOh ho ho did youdid you twig him Jack he gasped Saw you eversuch a mincing pussinboots since the Lord made you Ah ha haThe devil take your illtimed humor I cried Up with you man andlet us vanish while we mayBy this the camp was in a pretty ferment as you would guessour latecaptive having had space enough to tell his tale Drunk or soberFalconnet was afoot and alert shouting his orders to the Englishmen whowere scrambling for their arms and to the Indians who came swarming upfrom the lodgesWhilst we looked the Cherokees scattered like a company of trainedgillies to beat us out of cover and when the hunt was fairly up thebaronetcaptain set his men in marching order to surround the wigwam ofthe captivesAs yet there was time for a swift retreat up the valley or at least forthe choosing of some battlefield of our own where the enemy need notoutnumber us twenty to one and again I urged Richard to bestir himselfBut it was the sight of Falconnets troopers deploying to surround thetepeelodge and not any word of mine that broke his merriment in themidstAt a bound he was up and handing me my swordGood by Jack go you whilst you can Youll be like to meet Eph andthe Catawba coming in turn them back and tell them to bide their timeBut you I would sayMy place is inside of that soldiercordon our friend is drawing abouthis dovecote I shall be at hand when she needs me as I promisedAye so you may be but not alone said I and with that we fell torunning like a pair of doubling foxes through the wood on the steepslope behind the lodge striving with might and main to gain the laurelthicket whence we had made our first reconnaissance before theconverging lines of the redcoat cordon should close and shut us outWe did it by the skin of our teeth diving to cover through the closinggap not a second too soon When we were in and hugging the bare groundunder the scanty leafing of the laurel I take no shame in saying that Iwould have given a kings ransom to be at large again Had there beenbut one of us the covert would have been cramped enough and I waspainfully conscious that my borrowed coat of scarlet was but a poorthing to hide inTo make it worse Falconnet who had lagged behind at the fire was nowheaping fresh fuel on and this reviving of the blaze made the place aslight as day With the nearest links in the redcoat chain no more than apikeslength at our backs we dared not stir or breathe a word andall in all we might have been taken like rats in a trap had any one ofthe sentries on our side of the circle chanced to look behind himHaving repaired the fire to his liking the troopcaptain came up topass a word or two with his lieutenant They spoke guardedly but wecould hearcould not help hearingYou have seen nothing GordonNothing as yetMake the round again and tell the men twill be ten gold joes and adouble allowance of liquor to the man who first claps eyes on any one ofthe fourThe subaltern went to carry out the order and Falconnet fell to pacingback and forth before the little wigwam I could see his face at theturn where the firelight fell upon him twas the face of a villain athis worst namely a villain half in liquor There was a lurking devilof passion peering out of the sensuous eyes and ever and anon hestopped as if to listen for some sound within the captives lodgeWhen the lieutenant returned to make his report he was given anotherorder to cap the firstYour line is too closedrawn and too conspicuous said the captainshortly Move the men out fifty paces in advance and bid them takecoverThey will scarce be within hail of each other at that says thelieutenantNear enough with ten gold pieces to sharpen their eyesight Go youwith them and hold them to their workThe line was presently extended as the order ran each link in thecordon chain advancing fifty paces on its front into the forest Dickfetched a deep sigh of relief and I thought less of the thinleafedcover and the scarlet coat of meFalconnet had resumed the pacing of his sentry beat before the lodgebut when his men were out of sight and hearing he stopped short andstole on tiptoe to lay his ear to the flapSo you are awake Mistress Margery Send your woman out I would speakwith youaloneThere was no reply but we could both hear the low anguished voice ofour dear lady praying for help in this her hour of trial Dick inchedaside to give me room freeing his weapon as I did mine We were notoverquiet about it but the captain of horse was too hot upon his owndevils business to look behind himHaving no answer from within he stooped to loose the flap It waspegged down on the inside He rose and whipped out his sword thefirelight fell upon his face again and we saw it as it had been the faceof a foul fiend from the pitOpen he commanded and when there was neither reply nor obedience hecut the flap free with his sword and flung it backThe two women within the wigwam were on their knees before a littlecrucifix hanging on the lodge wall So much we saw as we broke cover andran in upon the despoiler Then the battlemadness came upon us and Ifor one saw naught but the tensedrawn face of a swordsman fighting forhis lifea face in which the hot flush of evil passion had given placeto the ashen graying of fearWe drove at him together Dick and I and so must needs fall afoul ofeach other clumsily giving him time to spring back and so to miss theclaymore stroke which else would have shorn him to the middle Thenensued as pretty a bit of blade work as any master of the oldcutandthrust school could wish to see and through it all this kingscaptain of horse seemed to bear a charmed lifeThere was no punctilio of the code of honor in this duel  outranceKnowing our time was short we fought as men who fight with haltersround their necks not to decide a nice point at issue but to kill thisaccursed villain as we would kill a mad dog or a venomous reptile whoseliving on imperiled the life and honor of the woman we lovedThrice whilst I held him in play Dick rushed in to end it with ascythesweep of the broadsword and thrice the Scottish death was turnedaside by the flashing circle of steel wherewith the man strivingshrewdly to gain time made shift to shield himselfYet it was not in flesh and blood to fend the double onslaught for morethan some brief minute or two Play as he wouldand noschlgermeister of my old fieldmarshals picked troop could best himat this game of parry and defensehe must give ground step by stepslowly at the pressing of the Ferara and in quick backward leaps whenthe great broadsword bit at himFor the first few bouts he withstood us in grim silence But now Richardcut in again and the claymore stroke less skilfully turned asidebrought him to his knees This broke his bull courage somewhat andthough he was afoot and on guard before my point could reach him hebegan to bellow lustily for helpAs you would suppose the call was all unneeded At the first clash ofsteel the outlying troopers were up and swarming to the rescue and nowon all sides came the trampling rush of the inclosing cordon lineHad Falconnet held his ground a moment longer he would have had us fastin the jaws of the troopertrap but tis the fatal flaw in mere brutecourage that it will break at the pinch No sooner did the volunteercaptain catch a glimpse of his upcoming reinforcements than he mustneeds show us a clean pair of heels running like a craven coward andshouting madly to his men to close with us and cut us downAfter him roared Dick who was by now as ragemad as any berserkerand with a cut and thrust to right and left for the nipping trapjaws wewere out and away in chaseNow you may mark this as you will that whilst the devil hath need ofhis bondservant he will come between with a miracle if need be to keepthe villain breath of life in his vassal Three bounds beyond theclosing trapjaws fetched us pursued and pursuers to the open campfield and here the devils miracle was wrought Out of the forestfringe out of the skirting of undergrowth out of the very earth as itseemed uprose a yelling mob of Cherokeesthe detachment we had met inthe cavern returned in the very nick of time to cut us off from thepursuit and to ring us in a whooping circle of deathBack to back lad I shouted and twas thus we met their onslaughtIn such a fray as that which followed tis the trivial things that leavetheir mark upon the memory For one I recall the curious thrill ofmastermight it gave me to feel the play of Jennifers great shouldermuscles against my back in his plying of the heavy claymore Foranother I remember the sickening qualm I had when the warm blood of mysecondor mayhap twas the thirdgushed out upon my sword hand and Iremember too how the impaled one driven in upon the blade by thepressure of his fellows behind would lay hold of the sharp steel andtry in the death throe to withdraw itBut after that sickening qualm I recall only this that I could not freethe sword for another thrust and whilst I tugged and fought for spacethey dragged me down and buried me these fierce tribesmen piling sothick upon me that sight and sound and breath went out together and Iwas but an atom crushed to earth beneath the human avalancheXXIXIN WHICH HAVING DANCED WE PAY THE PIPERMeasured by the sense which takes cognizance of pauses it seemed no morethan a moment between the stamping out of breath and its gaspingrecovery But in the interval the scene had shifted from the opensavanna to a thinly set grove of oaks with the stream brawling throughthe midstTo the biggest of the trees I was tightly bound and a little way aparta fire newly kindled smoked and blazed up fitfully By the light ofthe fire a good score of the Cherokees were gathering deadfalls and drybranches to heap beside me and from the camp below the Indian lodgesof which were in plain view beyond the intervening horse meadow othersavages were hurrying to join the wood carriersSo far as these hasting preliminaries applied to me their meaning wasnot difficult to read I was to be burned at the stake in proper savagefashion But Richard Jenniferwhat had become of him A sound halfsigh half groan told me where to look Hard by bound to a tree as Iwas and so near that with a free hand I could have touched him was mypoor ladDick I criedHe turned his head as the closedrawn thongs permitted and gave me asmile as lovingtender as a womansAye Jack they have us hard and fast this time I have been prayingyoud never come alive enough to feel the fireWe were taken together So much I dared askIn the same onset Twas but a question of clock ticks in thatbacktoback business But they paid scot and lot this with an inchingnod toward a row of naked bodies propped sitting against a fallen treenine of them in all one with its severed head between its knees andthree others showing the gaping hacks and hewings of the greatbroadswordTheyve fetched them here to see us burn he went on But by thegods we have the warrant of two good blades and Ephraim Yeatesshuntingknife that the only fires theyll ever see are those of hellYeates I queried Then they have taken him and the Catawba aswellNot alive you may be sure else we should have them for company Butit has a black look for our friends that the flying column we met in thestreamcave came back so soon Moreover the bodies of the threepeacepipe smokers were found and brought in that will be the GreatBear holding his head in his hands at the end of yonder bloodymasqueradeI guessed as much God rest our poor comradesAye and God help Madge Tis no time for reproaches but amongst us wehave signed her death warrant with our bunglingsIf it were only death I groanedTis just that Jack said he no better mayhap but no worse Whenwe were downed by that screeching mob she was out and on her knees toFalconnet beseeching him to spare us He put her off smoothly at firstsaying twas the Indians affairthat they would not be balked of theirvengeance by any interference of his But when she only begged the morepiteously he showed his true colors rapping out that we should have asswift a quittance as we had meant to give him and that within the hourshe should be the mistress of Appleby and free to marry an EnglishgentlemanWell said I making sure that now at last he must know allAt that she stood before him bravely and I saw that all the time shehad had the Catawbas knife hidden in the folds of her gown You havespoken truth for once Captain Falconnet I shall be free she saidCome and tell me when you have added these to your other murdersAnd thenThen she went back to her prison wigwam walking through the rabble ofredcoats and redskins as proudly as the Scottish Mary went to theblockShe will do it think you I queried fearful lest she would but morefearful lest her courage should fail at the pinchNever doubt it Good Catholic as she is there is martyr blood in heron the mothers side and that will help her to die unsullied And Godnerve her to it say II said Amen to that and thereupon we both fell silent watching ascondemned men on the gallows the busy preparations for our taking offAgain as in the late battle it was the trivial things that moved memost Chief among them the grinning row of dead Indians propped againstthe fallen tree is the constant background for all the memory picturesof that waiting interval and I can see those stiffening corpses nowsome erect as if defying us some lopping this way or that as if theirbones had gone to water at the touch of the steelI know not why these poor relics of mortality should have held mefascinated as they did Yet when I would look away through the vista towhere the light of the great fire in the savanna camp played luridlyupon the Indian lodges or nearer at hand upon the savages gatheringthe wood to burn us with this ghastly file of the dead drew meirresistibly and I must needs pass the fearsome figures in reviewagain marking the staring eyes and unnatural postures and thecircular bloodblack patches on the heads of the three peacemen whomYeates and the Catawba had scalpedWhile they were making ready for the burning our executioners werestrangely silent but when the work was done they formed in a semicircleto front the row of corpses and set up a howling chant that would haveput a band of Mohammedan dervishes to the blushTis the death song for the slain said Richard and while it lastedthis moving tableau of naked figures keeping time in a weird stampingdance to the rising and falling ululation of the chant held usspellboundBut we were not long suffered to be mere curious onlookers In itsdismalest flight the death song ended in a shrill hubbub and thedancers turned as one man to face usI hope it may never be your lot my dears to meet and endure such ahorrid glare of human ferocity as that these wroughtup avengers ofblood bent upon us Twas more unnerving than aught that had gonebefore more terrible I thought than aught that could come after Yetas to this you shall judge for yourselvesThe pause was brief and when a lad ran up to cut the thongs that boundus from the middle up the tortureplay began in deadly earnest Whilstthe Indian youth was slashing at the deerskin Richard gave me my cueTis the knife and hatchet play they are loosing us to give usfreedom to shrink and dodge Look straight before you and never flinch ahair as you would keep the life in you from one minute to the nextTrust me said I We must eke it out as long as we can if only togive our dear lady time for another prayer or two Mayhap she will nameus in them God knows our need is sore enoughThe lad ran back and a warrior stood out juggling his tomahawk in airHe made a feint to cast it at Richard but instead sent it whizzing atmeThat first missile was harder to face unflinching than were all theothers I saw it leave the throwers hand saw it coming straight as Iwould think to split my skull The prompting to dodge was wellnighmasterful enough to override the strongest will Yet I did make shift tohold fast and in mid flight the twirling ax veered aside to miss me bya hairsbreadth gashing the tree at my ear when it struckBravo well met cried Richard and then betwixt his teeth Herecomes mineAs he spoke a second tomahawk was sped I heard it strike with a dullcrash that might have been on flesh and bone or on oakbarkI couldnot tell I dared not look aside till Richards taunting laugh gave meleave to breathe againThe Indians answered the laugh with a yell and now the marksmen stoodout quickly one after another and for a little space the air was full ofhurtling missiles You will read in the romances of the wondrous skillof these savages in such diversions as these how they will pin thevictim to a tree and never miss of sticking knife or hatchet within thethickness of the blade where they will But you must take these taleswith a dash of allowance for the romancers fancy Truly these Indiansof ours threw well and skilfully tis a part of the only trade theyknowthe trade of warto send a weapon true to the mark None theless some of the missiles flew wide and now and then one would nip thecloth of sleeve or body coveringand the flesh beneath it as wellDick had more of the nippings than I and though he kept up a runningfire of taunts and gibing flings at the marksmen I could hear thegritting oaths aside when they pinked himNotwithstanding the worst of these miscasts fell to my lot A hatchetsped by the clumsiest hand of all missed its curving turned and thehelve of it struck me fair in the stomach Not all the parting pangs ofdeath as I fondly believe will lay a heavier toll on fortitude thandid this gripingstroke which I must endure standing erect Tis nofigure of speech to say that I would have given the reversion of akingdom and a crown to boot for leave to double over and groan out theagony of itHappily for us there were no women with the band so we were spared thecrueler refinements of these anteburning torments the flaying alive byinchbits and the sticking of blazing splints of pitchwood in theflesh to make death a thing to be prayed for There was naught of thisand tiring finally of the marksman play the Indians made ready to burnus Some ran to recover the spent weapons others made haste to heap thewood in a broad circle about our trees and the chief with three orfour to help renewed the deerthong lashingsTwas in the rebinding that this headman a right kinglylooking savageas these barbarians go thrust a bit of paper into my hand and gave metime to glance its message out by the light of the fire Twas a linefrom Margery and this is what she said     Dear Heart     Though you must needs believe my love is pledged to your good     friend and mine tis yours and yours alone my lionhearted     one I am praying the good God to give you dying grace and me     the courage to follow you quickly Margery     This by the hand of TallachamaFor one brief instant a wave of joy caught and flung me upon its highestcrest and all these savage tormentors could do to me became as naughtThen the true meaning of this her brave Ave atque vale smote me like aspaceflung meteor and the joywave became an ocean of despair toengulf me in its blackest depths The letter was never meant for metwas for Richard Jennifer who as she would think must know thestory of her marriage to his friend and must believe her love went withthe giving of her hand And she named him LionHeart because he wasbrave and true and strong like that first English Richard of thekingly lineI thrust the message back upon the bearer of it begging him in dumbshow to give it quickly to my companion I knew not at the time if hedid it being so crushed and blinded by this fresh misery But when theIndians drew off to ring us in a chanting circle for the final act Iwould not let the lad see my face for fear he might fathom theheartbreak in me and know the cause of itTwas at this crisis when all was ready and one had run to fetch thefire that I heard a smothered oath from Dick and saw the Indian who wascoming up to fire the wood heaps drop his brand and tread upon itEcod said a voice courtierlike and smoothly modulated Tis mostdevilish lucky I came Captain Ireton Another moment and they wouldhave grilled you in the kings uniforma rank treason to say naught ofpoor Jack Warden left without a clout to cover himIt needed not the glance aside to name mine enemy But I would notpleasure him with an answer Neither would Richard Jennifer He stoodsilent for a little space smiling and nursing his chin in one hand ashis habit was Then he spoke againI came to bid you Godspeed gentlemen You tumbled bravely into mylittle trap I made no doubt youd follow where the lady led and so youdid But youll turn back from this I do assure you if there be anyvirtue in an Indian barbecueAt this Richard could hold in no longerCurse you he gritted Do you mean that you kidnapped Mistress Stairto draw us out of hidingTruly said this archfiend smiling again Most unluckily for youyou both stood in my wayyou see I am speaking of it now as a thingpastand I chanced upon this thought of killing two birds with the onestone nay three I should say if you count the lady inHave done choked Richard in a voice thick with impotent rage Giveplace you hound and let your savages to their workAt your pleasure Mr Jennifer I have no fancy for funeral bakedmeats hot or cold though they be made as now to furnish forth amarriage supper I bid you good night gentlemen Ill go and make thatcall upon the lady which you were so rude as to interrupt a little whileago And with that he turned his back upon us and strode awayforgetting to tell his redskinned myrmidons to strip me of that kingsuniform he was so loath to have me burned inThe Cherokees waited till the masterexecutioner was out of sight amongthe trees Then they set up their infernal howling again and thefirelighter ran to fetch a fresh brandCourage lad twill soon be over now said I hearing a groan frommy poor DickHis reply was a chattering curse not upon Falconnet or the Indians butupon his malady the tertian feverNow by all the fiends Im chilling again Jack he gasped If thesecursed woodwolves mark it theyll set it down to woman cowardice andthat will break my heartAgain I bade him be of good courage assuring him not derisively as itlooks when tis written out that the fire would presently medicine thechilling In the middle of the saying the lighted brand was fetched andthrust among our fagotings and the upwardcurling smoke wreaths made megasp and strangle at the finishFor a little time after the sucking in of that firstsmokebreathnatures anodyne for any of her poor creatures doomed todie by fireI saw and heard less clearly and suffered only byanticipation But to this day the smell of burning pinewood is like asleeping potion to me and the sleep it brings is full of dreams vaguelytroubledSo while the Indians danced and leaped about us brandishing theirweapons and chanting the captives death song and while the blue andyellow tongues of flame mounted from twig to twig climbing stealthilyto flick at us like little vanishing demon whips I saw and heard andfelt as one remote from all the torture turmoil of the moment Throughthe dimming haze of sleeping sensibility the dancing savages became asmarionettes in some cunning puppet show and the blood stained figuresstiffening against their log took shapes less horrifyingTwas Dicks voice coming as it seemed from a mighty distance thatbroke the spell and brought me back to quickened agonies He spoke inpanting gasps as the smoke would let himOne word Jack before we gogo to our own place He saidhe said shewould be free toto marry him Tell me  O God in HeavenHis agony was a lash to cut me deeper than any flicking demon whip offlame yet I must needs add to itAye Richard I have wronged you wronged you desperately can you hearme yet I say I have wronged you and I shall die the easier if youllforgiveOnce more the smoke rising again in denser clouds cut me off andthrough the blinding blue haze of it I saw the Indians running up withgreen branches to beat it down lest it should spoil their sport oversoonby smothering us out of handWith the chance to gasp and breathe again I would have confessed in fullto Richard Jennifer and had him shrive me if he would But when Icalled he did not answer His head was rolling from side to side andhis handsome young face was all drawn and distorted as in the awfulgrimaces of the death throeYou will not wonder that I could not look at him that I looked awayfor very pitys sake praying that I might quickly breathe the flamesas I made sure he had and so be the sooner past the anguish crisisThere was good hope that the prayer would have a speedy answer Thefires were burning clearer now leaping up in broad dragons tongues offlame from the outer edges of the fagot piles to curtain off all thatlay beyond Through the luminous flameveil the capering savages took onshapes the most weird and grotesque and when I had a glimpse of thedead mens row each hideous face in it seemed to wear a grin of leeringtriumphThus far there had been never a puff of wind to fan the blaze But nowabove the shrilling of the Indian chant and the crackling of the flamesa low growl of thunder trembled in the upper air and a gentle breezeswept through the treetopsSo now I would commend my soul to God making sure that the breath Hegave would go out on the wings of the first gust that should come todrive the fiery veil inward But when the gust came it was from behinda sweeping besom to beat down the leaping dragons tongues a pouringflood of blessed coolness to turn the ebbing lifetide and to set thedulled senses once more keenly alertWith the wind came the rain a passing summernights shower of greatdrops spattering on the leaves above and dripping thence to fall hissingin the fires Then the thunder growled again and into the monotonousdroning of the Indian chant or rather rising sharp and clear above itcame a sudden rattling fire of musketry from the camp in thesavannathis and the sharp skirling of the troop captains whistleshrilling the assemblyWhile yet the flames lay flattened in the wind I saw the Indians wheeland bound away to the rescue of their camp like a pack of hounds in fullcry In a trice they were wallowing through the stream at the foot ofthe powder boulder and then as the flames leaped up again a dark formburst through the fiery barrier my bonds were cut and a strong handplucked me out of the scorching hellpitIf I did aught to help it was all mechanical I do remember dimly somefierce struggle to free my legs from the blazing tangle this and theswelling sob of joy at the sight of the faithful Catawba hacking atDicks lashings and dragging him also free of the fire And you maybelieve the welcome tears came to ease the pain of my seared eyes whenmy poor ladI had thought him gone past human helptook two staggeringsteps and flung his arms about my neckUncanoola gave us no time to come by easy stages to fullwit sanity Ina twinkling he had pounced upon us to crush us one upon the other behindthe larger tree And now I come upon another of those flitting instantsso crowded with happenings that the swiftest pen must seem to make themlag Twas all in a heartbeat as it were the Catawbas freeing ofus his flinging us to earth behind the tree a spurt of blinding yellowflame from the foot of the powdercliff and a booming jarring shocklike that of an earthquakeThe momentary glare of the yellow flash lit up a scene mostaweinspiring The spouting fountain of fire at the base of the greatpowderrock was thick with flying missiles and on high the very cliffitself was tottering and crumbling So much I saw then the Catawbasprang up to haul us afoot by main strength and to rush us with an armfor each headlong through the wood toward the valley headBut Dick hung back and when the dull thunder of the falling rocks thecrash of the tumbling cliff and the shrill death yells of the doomedones came to our ears he fought loose from the Indian and flung himselfdown crying as if his heart would breakO God shes lost shes lostand I have missed the chance to diewith her or for herXXXHOW EPHRAIM YEATES PRAYED FOR HIS ENEMIESHowever much or little the Catawba understood of Richard Jennifersgrief or its cause the faithful Indian had a thing to do and he did itloosing his grasp of me to turn and fall upon Dick with pullings andhaulings and buffetings fit to bring a man alive out of a verystiffening rigor of despairSo in a handspace he had him up and we were pressing on again inmidnight darkness once we had passed beyond the light of our grillingfires No word was spoken under the impatient urging of the Indianthere was little breath to spare for speech But when Richardsafterthought had set its fangs in him he called a halt and would not bedeniedGo on you two if you are set upon it he said I must go backBethink you Jack what if she be only maimed and not killed outrightTis too horrible Im going back I sayThe Catawba grunted his disgustCaptain Jennif talk fas no run fas What think White squawyonderno yonder pointing first forward and then back in thedirection of the stricken campRichard spun around and gripped the Indian by the shoulders Then sheis alive and safe he burst out Speak friend whilst I leave thebreath in you to do itUgh said the chief in nowise moved either by Jennifers vehemence orby the doglike shake What for Captain Jennif think papoose thinksbout the Gray Wolf and poor Injun Catch um white squaw firs thenblow um up Chelakee camp and catch um Captain Jennif and CaptainLongknife if can Heap do firs thing firs and las thing lasWahIt was the longest speech this devoted ally of ours was ever known tomake and having made it he went dumb again save for his urgings of usforward But presently both he and I had our hands full with the poorlad The swift transition from despair to joy proved too much for Dickand besides the fever was in his blood and he was grievously burnedSo we went stumbling on through the clouddarkened wood locked arm inarm like three drunken men tripping over root snares and bramble netsspread for our feet and getting well sprinkled by the dripping foliageAnd at the last when we reached the ravine at the valleys head Dickwas muttering in the fever delirium and we were wellnigh carrying him adead weight between usTwas a most heartbreaking business getting the poor lad up thatrockladder of escape in the darkness for though I had come out of thefire with fewer burns than the roasting of me warranted the battlepreceding it had opened the old sword wound in my shoulder So takingit all in all I was but a shortbreathed second to the faithfulCatawbaNone the less we tugged it through after some laborious fashion andwere glad enough when the steep ascent gave place to leveler going andwe could sniff the fragrance of the plateau pines and feel theirwirelike needles under footBy this the shower cloud had passed and the stars were coming out butit was still pitch black under the pines so dark that I started like anervous woman and went near to panic when a horse snorted at my veryear and a voice bodiless as it seemed said Well now the Lord bepraised if here aint the whole enduringWhat Ephraim Yeates would have said or did say was lost upon me Fornow my poor Dicks strength was quite spent and when the chief and Iwere easing him to lie full length upon the ground there was a quicklittle cry out of the darkness a swish of petticoats and my ladydarted in to fall upon Richard in a very transport of pityOh my poor Dick they have killed you she sobbed oh cruelcruel Then she lashed out at us Why dont you strike a light Howcan I find and dress his hurts in the darkYour pardon Mistress Margery I said tis only that the fever hasovercome him He has no sore hurts as I believe save thefirescorchingA light she commanded I must have a light and see for myselfWe had to humor her though it was something against prudence Ephraimfound dry punk in a rotten log and firing it with the flint and steelof a great kings musketone of his reavings from the enemysoon had apineknot torch for her She gave it to the Catawba to hold and whileshe was cooing over her patient and binding up his burns in some simplesgathered near at hand by the Indian I had the story of the doublerescue from the old hunterSet forth in brief that which had come as a miracle to Dick and mefigured as a daring bit of strategy made possible by the emptying of theIndian camp at our torture spectacleYeates and the Catawba following out the plan agreed upon had comewithin spying distance while yet we were in the midst of that hopelessbacktoback battle and had most wisely held aloof But later whenevery Indian of the Cherokee band was busy at our torture trees theyset to workWith no watch to give the alarm twas easy to rifle the Indian wigwamsof the firearms and ammunition The latter they threw into the streamthe muskets they loaded and trained over a fallen tree at the northernedge of the savanna bringing them to bear pointblank upon thelighthorse guard gathered again around the great fireThe next step was the cutting out of the women this was effectedwhilst the baronetcaptain was paying his courtesy call on us Like thelooting of the Indian camp twas quickly planned and daringly done itasked but the quieting of the two trooper guards on the forest side ofthe tepeelodge a warning word to Margery and her woman and ashadowlike flitting with them over the dead bodies of their latejailers to the shelter of the woodOnce free of the camp Yeates had hurried his charges to a place oftemporary safety farther up the valley leaving the Catawba to cross thestream to lay a train of dampened powder to the makeshift magazine Whenhe had led the women to a place of safety the old man left them and ranback to his masked battery of loaded muskets Here at an owlcry signalfrom Uncanoola he opened fire upon the redcoatsThe outworking of the coup de main was a triumph for the oldborderers shrewd generalship At the deathdealing volley theEnglishmen were thrown into confusion whilst the Indians summoned bythe firing and the shrilling of the captains whistle dashed blindlyinto the trap At the right moment Uncanoola touched off his powdertrain and cut in with a clear field for his rescue of Dick and meOf the complete success of these various climaxings Ephraim Yeates hadhis first assurance when we three came safely to the rendezvous forafter firing his masked battery the old hunter lost no time inrejoining the women and in hastening with them out of the valley Hadthese three been afoot we might have overtaken them but Yeates had beenlucky enough to stumble upon the black mare peacefully cropping thegrass in a little glade and with this mount for Margery and hertirewoman he had easily outpaced usAll this I had from Yeates what time Margery was pouring the wine andoil of womanly sympathy into Richards woundings and I may confess thatwhilst the ear was listening to the hunters tale the eye was takingnote of these her tender ministrations and the heart was setting themdown to the score of a great love which would not be denied Twasaltogether as I would have had it and yet the thought came unbiddenthat she might spare a niggard moment and the breath to ask me how Idid And because she would not I do think my burns smarted the cruelerIt was to have surcease of these extra smartings that I turned my backupon the trio under the flaring torch and took up with Ephraim Yeatesthe pressing question of the momentAs I take it we may not linger here I said Have you marked out aline of retreatThe old borderer was busied with his loot of the Indian camptwas notin his nature to come off emptyhanded however hard pressed he had beenfor time In the raffle of it guns and pistols dressed skins andwarrior finery he came upon my good old blade and Richards greatclaymoretrophies claimed by the head men of the Cherokees after ourtaking as we made no doubtFound em hanging in the lodge that usen to belong to the Great Bearsaid the hunter and then with grim humor Lowed to keep em toricollect ye by if so be ye was foreordained and predestinated to go upin a fiery chariot like the good old Elijah The weapons disposed ofhe made answer to my query Ez for making tracks immejitly if notsooner I allow there aint no two notions about that But Imdaddaddled if I know whichaway to put out Capn John and thats thegospil factWhy not strike for the Great Trace and so go back the way the powderconvoy came I askedIt could be done he said but the hazard was great Twas out of allreason to hope that there were no survivors left in the sunken valley tocarry the news of the earthquake massacre That news once cried abroadin the nearby Cowee Towns the entire Tuckasege nation would turn outto run us down Moreover the avengers would look to find us in the onlypracticable horsepath leading eastwardEz Im telling you right now Capn John we made one more blunder inthis here onfall of ourn owin to our having neer a seventh son of aseventh son amongst us to look a little ways ahead Where we flashed inthe pan was in not making our rendyvoo down yonder where you and CapnDick got in Ever last one of em able to crawl is amaking straightfor that crivvis dodgehole right now and if we was there we could doem like the Gileadites did the men o Ephraim at the passages o theJordanFresh as I was from the torture fire I could not forbear a shudder atthis old mans savageryKill them in cold blood I would sayAnan he queried as not understanding my point of view and I let thematter rest He was of those who slay and spare not where an enemy isconcernedBut when we came to consider of it there seemed to be no alternative tothe eastward flitting by way of the Great Trace To the west and souththere was only the trackless wilderness and to the north no whitesettlement nearer than that of the overmountain folk on the Watauga Iasked if we might hope to reach thisTis a long fifty mile ez the crow flies over eenabout themountainousest patch o land that ever laid out o doors was thehunters reply And there aint neer a deertrack ez I knows on topint the wayThen we must ride eastward and run the risk of pursuit by theTuckaseges said IEz I reckon thats about the long and short of it And I doeverlastedly despise to make that poor little gal jump her hoss and rideskimperscamper again when shes been fair living ahorseback for afortnightShe will not fail you I ventured to say adding But Jennifer is inpoor fettle for making speedIts ride or be skulped for him and I allow hell ride quoth the oldhunter hastening his preparations for the start Reckon we can get himon a hoss right nowI went to see Margery rose at my approach and even in the poor light Icould see her draw herself up as if she would hold me at my properdistanceYour patient Mistress MargeryWe must mount and ride at once Is hefitNoBut we must be far to the eastward before daybreakI can not help it If you make him ride tonight you will finish whatthose cruel savages began Captain IretonWe have little choicenone I should sayOh you are bitter hard she cried though wherein my offending layjust then I was wholly at a loss to knowTis your privilege to say so I rejoined But as for making Dickride that will be but the kindest cruelty We are only a little wayfrom the nearest Indian towns and if the daylight find us hereSpare me she broke in and with that she turned shortly and askedEphraim Yeates to put her in her saddleRichard was still in the fever stupor but he roused himself at myurging and let us set him upon his beast Once safe in the saddle welashed him fast like a prisoner with a forked treebranch at his backto hold him erect This last was the old hunters invention and twasmost ingenious The forked limb in shape like a Y was set astride thecantle with the lower ends thonged stoutly to Dicks legs and to thegirths Thus the upright stem of the inverted Y became an easy backrestfor the sick man and when he was securely lashed thereto there waslittle danger for him save in some stumbling of the beast he rodeWhen all was ready we had first to find our way down from the mountaintop and now even the old borderer and the Indian confessed theirinability to do aught but retrace their steps by the only route theyknew namely by that ravine which we had twice traversed in daylightand up which they had led the captured horses in the duskThis route promised all the perils of a gantletrunning since by it wemust take the risk of meeting the fleeing fugitives from the convoycamp if the explosion had spared any fit to lift and carry thevengeancecry But here again there was no alternative and we set us inorder for the descent with Yeates and the Catawba ahead the women andDick in the midst and her Apostolic Majestys late captain of hussarsmasquerading as a British trooper to bring on the rearOnce in motion beneath the blueblack shadows of the pines I quicklylost all sense of direction After we had ridden in wordless silence ashort half hour or less and I supposed we should be nearing the headof our descending ravine our little cavalcade was halted suddenly in athickset grove of the pines and Ephraim Yeates appeared at my stirrupto sayHist ye off your nag Capn John and lets take a farwell squinch atthe inimy whilst we canWhere what enemy I would ask slipping from the saddle at his wordWhy the hosscaptains varmints to be sure or whatall theabomination o desolation has left of em We aint more than a catsjump from the edge o the big rock where we first sot eyes on em thismorningI saw not what was to be gained by any such longrange espial in thedarkness None the less I followed the old man to the cliffs edge Hewas wiser in his forecastings than I was in mine There was a thing tolook at and light enough to see it by One of the missile stones itseems had crashed into the great fire scattering the brands in alldirections The pinebough troop shelters were ablaze and creepingserpents of fire were worming their way hither and yon over the yearoldleaf beds in the wood Ever and anon some pine sapling in the path ofthese fiery serpents would go up in a torchlike flare and so as Isay there was light enoughWhat we looked down upon was not inaptly pictured out by EphraimYeatess Scripture phrase the abomination of desolation Every vestigeof the camp save the glowing skeletons of the troop shelters haddisappeared and the swarded savanna was become a blackened chaosbloton the fair woodland scene I have said that the powdershelteringboulder was a cliff for size the mighty upheaval of the explosion hadtoppled it in ruins into the stream and huge fragments the bigness of awinebutt had been hurled with the storm of lighter debris broadcastupon the campAt first we saw no sign of life in all the firelit space But a momentlater when three or four of the sapling torches blazed up together wemade out some half dozen figures of human beingswhether red or whitewe could not tellstumbling and reeling about among the rocks likeblind men drunkenAt sight of these the old hunter doffed his cap and fell upon his kneeswith hands uplifted to pour out his zealots soul in the awful sentencesof the Psalmists imprecationLet God arise and let His inimies be scattered let them also thathate Him flee before Him Like as the smoke vanisheth so shalt thoudrive them away and like as the wax melteth at the fire so let theungodly perish at the presence of GodXXXIIN WHICH WE MAKE A FORCED MARCHIt could have been but little short of midnight when we came down intothe Great Trace near the ambush ground where we had set our trap for thepeace menThe night had cleared most beautifully and overhead the stars wereburning like points of white fire in the black dome of the heavens Asoften happens after a shower the night shrillings of the forest were infullest tide and a whipwillswidow disturbed by our approachfluttered to a higher perch and set up his plaintive protestAt our turning eastward on the trace the old hunter massed our littlecompany as compactly as the path allowed and giving us the word tofollow cautiously tossed his bridle rein to the Catawba and went onahead to feel out the wayThis rearrangement set me to ride abreast with Margery and for thefirst time since that fateful night in the upper room at Appleby Hundredwe were together and measurably aloneSince death might be lying in wait for us at any turn in the windingbridlepath I had no mind to break the strained silence Butwomanlike she would not miss the chance to thrust at meAre you not afire with shame Captain Ireton she said bitterly andthen How you must despise meI knew not what she meant but being most anxious for her safety Ibegged her not to talk putting it all upon the risk we ran in passingthe outlet of the sunken valley Now as you have long since learned mytongue was but a skilless servant and though I sought to make thecommand the gentlest plea she took instant umbrage and struck backsmartlyYou need not make the danger an excuse I will be still and when Ispeak to you again you will be willing enough to hear me I promiseyouNay then dear lady you must not take it so I protested Tis mymisfortune to be ever blunderingBut to this she gave me no answer at all and barring a word or two ofheartening for her serving woman she never opened her lips againthroughout the passage perilousBy good hap we came to the crossing of the cavern stream without meetingany foeman and on the farther side of the shallow ford we found the oldborderer awaiting usEz I allow weve smelt the bait in the trap and come off with wholebones like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego he said mixing metaphorScripture phrase and frontier idiom as was his wont Then he put a legover his horse and gave the stirrupword From now on old Jehu theson o Nimshi is the hosswhipper weve got to beat Get ye behindCapn John and give the hoss that lags a half inch r so of yourswordpintThen and there began a night flight long to be remembered Down thevalley of the swift river to the ford where Yeates and I had crossedafter the mock rescue of Margery the night before we let the horsespick the way as they could But once beyond the ford where the tracewas wider and the footing less precarious we plied whip and spurpushing the saddlebeasts for every stride we could get out of them inthe blind raceI have marveled often that we came not once to grief in all this longnightgallop through the darkness There was every chance for it Theoverarching trees of the great forest shut out all the starlight andthe trace was no more than a bridlepath rougher than any cart roadYet we held the breakneck pace steadily save for the time it took tothread some steep defile to a stream crossing or to scramble up itsfellow on the opposite side and when the dawn began to gray in the skyahead we were well out of the broken mountain region and into theopener forest of the hill countryThe sun was yet below the eastern horizon when we came to the fording ofa larger stream than any we had crossed in the night Its course wastoward the sunrise hence I took it for some tributary of the Catawbaor the BroadTis the Broad itself said Ephraim Yeates in answer to my askingand yit it aint leastwise it aint the one you know Tis the onethe Parleyvoos claimed in the old war and they call it the FrinchBroadBut that flows north and westward if I remember aright said ISo it do so it doin gineral But hereabouts twill run all ways forSunday by spellsIf this be the French Broad we are not yet out of the Tuckasegecountry as I take itMighty nigh to it nigh enough to make camp for a resting spell Ireckon yere aneeding that same pretty tolerble bad aint ye littlegal this last to MargeryWeary as she was she smiled upon him brightly as though he had been hergrandsire and so free to name her how he pleasedI shall sleep well when we are out of danger But you must not stop forme or for Jeanne till tis safe to do soSafe Lord love ye child safe is a word beyond us yit and will betill we sot ye down on your daddys doorstone But well make out togive ye a bite and sup and forty winks o sleep immejitly if notsooner nowSo on the farther side of the stream the hunter led the way aside andwhen we were come to a small meadow glade with good grazing for thehorses he called a halt lifted the women from their saddles and cameto help me ease Dick down The poor lad was stiff and sore having nomore use of his joints than if he were a bandaged mummy but the feverdelirium had passed and he was able to laugh feebly at the treelimbcontrivance rigged to hold him in the saddleHow did we come out of it Jack he asked when we had let him feelthe comfort of lying flat upon his back on the soft swardAs you see We are all here and all in fair fettle saving yourselfYoure the heaviest loserHe smiled and his eyes languid with the fever sought out Margery whowould not come anigh whilst I was with himThat remains to be seen Jack If my dream comes true I shall be therichest gainerWhat did you dreamHe beckoned me to bend lower over him I dreamed I was sore hurt andthat she was binding up my bruises and crying over meTwas no dream I said and with that I went to help Yeates make abough shelter for the women while Uncanoola was grinding the maize forthe breakfast cakesTis not my purpose to weary you with a daybyday accounting for allthat befell us on the way back to Mecklenburg Suffice it to say that weate and slept and rose to mount and ride again this for five days andnights during which Jennifers fever grew upon him steadilyAt the close of the fifth day our night halt was in a deserted logcabin at the edge of an unfinished clearing in the heart of the forestHere Richards sickness anchored us and for three full weeks thejourney pausedWe nursed the lad as best we could for a fortnight dosing him withstewings of such roots and herbs as the Catawba could find in the woodThen when we were at our wits ends and Yeates and I were castingabout how we could compass the bringing of a doctor from thesettlements the fever took a turn for the betterof its own accordor for Uncanoolas physickings we knew not whichand at the end ofthe third week Dick was up and able to ride again this time without theforked stick to hold him in the saddleAfter this we went on without mishap and with no hardship greater thanthat of living solely upon the meat victual provided by the huntersrifle and you who know this ploughdressed region at this later daywill wonder when I write it down that in all that long faring or ratherto the last days stage of it we saw never a face of any of our kindor of the CatawbasYou may be sure the month or more we spent thus in the heart of thewildwood was but a sorry time for me While the excitement of thepursuit and rescue lasted and later when anxiety for Richard filledthe hours of the long days and nights I was held a little back fromslipping into that pit of despair which I had digged for myselfBut when the strain was off and Dick was up and fit again the miseryof it all came back with added goadings I had never dreamed how cuttingsharp twould be to see these two together day by day to see herloving tender care of him and to hear him babble of his love for herin his feverish vaporings Yet all this I must endure and with it athing even harder For to make it worse if worse could be the shadowof complete estrangement had fallen between Margery and me True to herword given in that moment when I had besought her not to speak aloudfor her own safetys sake she had never opened her lips to me and foraught she said or did I might have been a deafmute slave beneath hernoticeAnd as she drew away from me she seemed to draw the closer to RichardJennifer nursing him alive when he was at his worst and giving him allthe womanly care and sympathy a sick man longs for And later when hewas fit to ride again she had him always at her side in the onwardfaringAs I have said before this was all as I would have it Yet it made mesick in my souls soul and at times I must needs fall behind to rave itout in solitude cursing the day that I was born and that other moremisfortunate day when I had reared the barrier impassable between thesetwoWhat wonder then that as we neared the fighting field of the greatwar I grew more set upon seizing the first chance that might offer anhonorable escape from all these heartburnings Twas a weakness if youchoose I set down here naught but the simple fact which had by nowgone as far beyond excusings as the underlying cause of it was beyondforgivenessTwas on the final day the day when we were riding tantivy to reachQueensborough by evening that my deliverance came I say deliverancebecause at the moment it had the look of a short shrift and a readyhalterWe had crossed our own Catawba and were putting our horses at the steepbank on the outcoming side when my saddle slipped Dismounting totighten the girth I called to the others to press on saying I shouldovertake them shortlyThe promise was never kept I scarce had my head under the saddle flapbefore a couple of stout knaves in homespun appearing from I know notwhere had me fast gripped by the arms whilst a third made sure of thehorseA despatch rider said the bigger of the two who pinioned me Searchhim Martin lad whilst I hold him then well pay him out forTarletons hanging of poor Sandy MGuireI held my peace and let them search taking the threat for a bit ofsoldier bullyragging meant to keep me quiet But when they had turnedthe pockets of my borrowed coat inside out and ripped the lining andmade it otherwise as much the worse for their mishandling as it was forwear the third man fetched a ropeDid you mean that friendabout the hanging I asked wondering ifthis should be my loophole of escape from the life grown hatefulSure enough said the big man coolly Youd best be saying yourprayersI laughed Were you wearing my coat and I yours you might hang me andwelcome in truth you may as it is Which tree will you have me atThe man stared at me as at one demented Then he burst out in a guffawDamme if you beant a cool plucked one Ive a mind to take you to thecolonelDont do it my friend Though I am something loath to be snuffed outby the men of my own side we need not haggle over the niceties Pointout your treeNo by God youre too willing Whats at the back of all thisNothing save a decent reluctance to spoil your sport Have at it manand lets be done with itNot if you beg me on your knees Youll go to the colonel I say andhe may hang you if he sees fit You must be a most damnable villain towant to die by the first rope you lay eyes onThat is as it may be Who is your colonelNay rather who are youI gave my name and circumstance and was loosed of the handgrip thoughthe third man dropped the cord and stepped back to hold me covered withhis rifleAn Ireton you say Not little Jock surelyNo big Jock big enough to lay you on your back though you do have ahand as thick as a hamHe ignored the challenge and stuck to his text I never thought to seethe son of old Madbull Roger wearing a red coat he saidThat is nothing Many as good a Whig as I am has been forced to wear ared coat ere this or go barebacked But why dont you knot the halterIn common justice you should either hang me or feed me Tis hard uponnoon and I breakfasted earlyFall in said the big man and so I was marched quickly aside from theroad and into the denser thicketing of the wood Here my captorsblindfolded me and after spinning me around to make me lose the compasspoints hurried me away to their encampment which was inland from thestream though not far for I could still hear the distanceminishedsplashing of the waterWhen the kerchief was pulled from my eyes I was standing in the midst ofa mounted riflemens haltcamp face to face with a young officerwearing the uniform of the colonelcy in the North Carolina home troopsHe was a handsome young fellow with curling hair and trim sidewhiskersto frame a face finelined and eagerthe face of a gentleman wellbornand wellbredCaptain Ireton he said by which I guessed that one of my capturershad run on ahead to make reportThe same I repliedAnd you are the son of Mr Justice Roger Ireton of Appleby HundredI have that honorHe gave me his hand most cordiallyYou are very welcome Captain Davie is my name I trust we may come toknow each other better You are in disguise as I take it do you bringnews of the armyOn the contrary I am thirsting for news I rejoined I and threeothers have but now returned from pursuing a British and Indian powderconvoy into the mountains to the westward We have been out five weeksand moreHe looked at me curiously You and three others he queried Comeapart and tell me about it whilst Pompey is broiling the venison Iscent a whole Iliad in that word of yours Captain IretonOne thing first if you please Colonel Davie I begged Mycompanions are faring forward on the road to Queensborough They knownaught of my detention Will you send a man to overtake them with a notefrom meThe colonel indulged me in the most gentlemanly manner and when my noteto Jennifer was despatched we sat together at the roots of a great oakand I told him all that had befallen our little rescue party He heardme through patiently and when the tale was ended was good enough to saythat I had earned a commission for my part in the affair I laughed andpromptly shifted that burden to Ephraim Yeatess shouldersThe old hunter was our general Colonel Davie He did all of theplanning and the greater part of the executing But for him and thefriendly Catawba it would have gone hard with Jennifer and meI fear you are overmodest Captain was all the reply I got and thenmy kindly host fell amuse When he spoke again twas to give me a rsumin brief of the military operations North and SouthAt the North as his news ran affairs remained as they had been savethat now the French king had sent an army to supplement the fleet andCount Rochambeau and the allies were encamped on Rhode Island ready totake the fieldIn the South the distressful situation we had left behind us on thatAugust Sunday following the disastrous battle of Camden was but littlechanged General Gates with the scantiest following had hastened firstto Salisbury and later to Hillsborough and had since been busy strivingto reassemble his scattered forcesA few military partizans like my host had kept the field doing whatthe few might against the many to retard my Lord Cornwalliss northwardmarch and a week earlier the colonel with his handful of mountedriflemen had dared to oppose his entry into CharlotteTwas no more than a hint to his Lordship that we were not afraid ofhim said my doughty colonel You know the town I take itVery well indeedWell we had harassed him all the way from Blairs Mill and twasmidnight when we reached Charlotte There we determined to make a standand give him a taste of our mettle We dismounted took post behind thestone wall of the court house green and under cover of the fences alongthe roadGood an ambush said IHardly that since they were looking to have resistance Tarleton wassick and Major Hanger commanded the British van He charged and wepeppered them smartly They tried it again and this time their infantryoutflanked us We abandoned the court house and formed again in theeastern edge of the town and now bless you twas my Lord Charleshimself who had to ride forward and flout at his men for their want ofenterpriseBut you could never hope to hold on against such odds I exclaimedOh no but we held them for a third charge and beat them back tooThen they brought up two more regiments and we mounted and got off intolerably good order losing only six men killed But Colonel FrancisLocke was one of these and my brave Joe Graham was all but cut topiecesa sore blow to us just nowThe colonel sighed and a silence fell upon us Twas I who broke it tosay Then we are still playing a losing hand in the South as I takeitTis worse than that As the game stands we have played all our trumpsand have not so much as a long suit left Cornwallis will go on as hepleases and overrun the state and the militia will never stand to fronthim again under Horatio Gates Worse still Ferguson is off to thewestward embodying the Tories by the hundred and we shall haveburnings and hangings and harryings to the kings tasteI nursed my knee a moment and then said What may one man do to helpColonel DavieHe looked up quickly Much if you are that man and you do not valueyour life too highly Captain IretonYou may leave that out of the question said I I shall count it thehappiest moment of my life when I shall have done something worth theirkilling me forAgain he gave me that curious look I had noted before Then he laughedIf you were as young as Major Joe Graham and had been well crossed inlove I could understand you better Captain But jesting aside thereis a thing to do and you are the man to do it Our spies are thick inCornwalliss camp but what is needed is some master spirit who can plotas well as spy for us Major Ferguson moves as Cornwallis pulls thestrings Could we know the majors instructions and designs we mightcut him off bring the Tory uprising to the ground and so hearten thecountry beyond measure I say we might cut him off though I know notwhere the men would come from to do itWell said I when he pausedThe preliminary is some better information than our spies can give usNow you have been an officer in the British service andI smiled Truly and I have the honor if you please to call it so ofhis Lordships acquaintance Also I have that of Colonel Tarleton andthe members of his staff the same having tried and condemned me as aspy at Appleby Hundred some few weeks before this chase I have told youofHis face fell Then of course it is out of the question for you toshow yourself in Cornwalliss headquartersI rose and buttoned my borrowed coatOn the contrary Colonel Davie I am more than ever at your serviceLet me have a cut of your venison and a feed for my horse and I shallbe at my Lords headquarters as soon as the nag can carry me thereXXXIIIN WHICH I AM BEDDED IN A GARRETTis a very pretty hazard Captain Ireton But can it be brought offsuccessfully think youAs I have said it hangs somewhat upon the safety of my portmanteau Ifthat has come through unseized to Mr Pettigrew at Charlotte and I canlay hands on it twill be half the battleYou say you left it behind you at New BerneYes Mr Carey was to forward it as he couldColonel Davie had given me bite and sup and I was ready to take theroad My plan such as it was had been determined upon and to thefurthering of it the colonel had written me a letter to a friend in thetown who might shelter me for a night and make the needed inquiry for mybelongings Also he had given me another letter of which more anonand had pressed upon me a small purse of gold piecesa treasure rareenough in patriot hands in that impoverished timeWhen all was done two of my late captors were ordered to set mestraight in the road and some halfhour past noon I had shaken handswith the big fellow in homespun who had been so bent upon hanging mewithout benefit of clergy had crossed the river and was making thefirst looping in a detour which should bring me into Charlotte from thewestwardTwas drawing on toward evening and I had recrossed the river a mile ormore below Appleby Hundred when I began to meet the outposts of theBritish army I was promptly halted by the first of these but myborrowed uniform and a ready word or two passed me within the lines as acourier riding post to headquarters from Major Ferguson in the westThe lieutenant in command of the first vedette line was notovercurious He asked me a few questions about the majors plans anddispositionsquestions which thanks to Colonel Davies information Iwas able to answer glibly enough swallowed my tale whole and was soobliging as to give me the password for the night to help me through theinner sentry linesThus fortified I rode on boldly and having the countersign thedifficulties vanished When I was come to town it was well pastcandlelighting and the patrol was out in force But by dint of usingthe password freely I made my way unhindered to the house of thegentleman to whom Colonel Davies letter accredited meHere however the difficulties began Though the camp of the army layjust without the town to the southward the officers were quartered inevery house and that of Colonel Davies friend was full tooverflowing What was to be done we knew not but at the last moment myfriends friend thought of an expedient and wrote a note for me whilst Iwaited half in hiding in the outer hallTis a desperate chance but these are desperate times said mywouldbe helper I am sending you to the town house of one of ourplantation seigneursa man who is fish flesh or fowl as his interestdemands I hear he came in today to take protection and there is achance that he will shelter you for the sake of your red coat and a goldpiece or two But I warn you you must be what you appear to beasoldier of the kingand not what this note of Colonel Davies says youareSeeing a wide field of dangerchances in this haphazarding I would haveasked more about this trimming gentleman to whom I was to be handed onbut at that moment there came a thundering at the door and my anxioushost was fain to hustle me out through the kitchen as he could catchingup a black boy on the way to be my guideGod speed you he said at parting Make your footing good for thenight if you can and well see what can be done tomorrow Ill sendyour portmanteau around in the morning if so be Mr Pettigrew has itWith that I was out in the night again turning and doubling after myguide who seemed to be greatly afeard lest I should come nigh enough tocast an evil eye upon himTwas but a little distance we had to go and I had no word out of myblack rascal till we reached the doorstone of a familiar mansion butone remove from the corner of the court house green Here with astuttering Dddis de house Massa he fled and left me to enter as IcouldSince the street was busily astir with redcoat officers and men comingand going and any squad of these might be the questioners to doubt mythreadbare courier tale I lost no time in running up the steps andhammering a peal with the heavy knocker Through the sidelights I couldsee that the wide entrance hall was for the moment unoccupied but atthe knockerlifting I had a flitting glimpse of some onea little manall in sober blackcoming down the stair There was no immediate answerto my peal but when I would have knocked again the door was swung backand I stepped quickly within to find myself face to face withMargeryI know not which of the two of us was the more dumbfounded but this Ido know that I was still speechless and fair witless when she swept mea lowdipped curtsy and gave me my greetingI bid you good evening Captain Ireton she said coldly and thenwith still more of the frost of unwelcome in her voice To what may webe indebted for this honorNow chilling as these words were they thrilled me to my fingertipsfor they were the first she had spoken to me since the night of myoffending in the black gorge of the faroff western mountains None theless they were blankly unanswerable and had the door been open Ishould doubtless have vanished as I had come Of all the houses in thetown this was surely the last I should have run to for refuge had Iknown the name of its master and it was some upflashing of this thoughtthat helped me find my tongueI never guessed this was your fathers house I stammered bowing lowto match her curtsy I beg you will pardon me and let me go as IcameShe laid a hand on the doorknob Isis there any one here whom youwould see she asked and now her eyes did not meet mine and I wouldthink the chill had melted a littleNo I was begging a nights lodging of a friend whose house is full Hesent me here with a note toahto your father as I suppose though inhis haste he did not mention the nameShe held out her hand Give me the letterNay said I that would be but thankless work Knowing me yourfather must needs conceive it his duty to denounce meGive it me she insisted this with an impatient little stamp of thefoot and an upglance of the compelling eyes that would have constrainedme to do a far foolisher thing had she asked itSo I gave her the letter and stood aside hat in hand while she readit There were candles in their sconces over the mantel and she movednearer to have the better light The soft glow of the candles fell uponher shining hair and upon cheek and brow and I could see her bosomrise and fall with the quickcoming breath and the pulse throbbing inher fair white neck And with the seeing I became a fool of love againin very earnest and was within a hairs breadth of sinking honor andall else in an outpouring of such words as a man may say once to onewoman in all the worldand having said them may never unsay themTwas a most practical little thing she did that saved me from fallingheadlong into this last ditch of dishonor Twisting the letter into aspill she stood on tiptoe to light it at one of the candles sayingTwas a foolish thing to put on paper and might well hang the writerin such times as these He says you are a kings man and well known tohim and you are neither But when the letter was a crisp of blackenedpaperash she turned upon me and once again the changeful eyes werecold and her words were strangerformalWhat is it you would have me do Captain IretonNothing I made haste to say nothing save to believe that I camehere unwittinglyand to let me goWhere will you go The town is alive with those who wouldwho wouldWho would show me scant mercy you would say True and yet I camehitherto the town I meanof my own free willHer mood changed in the pivoting fraction of an instant and now thebeautiful eyes were alight and warm and pleadingly eloquentOh why did you come Are youare you what they said you wereA spy If I am you would scarce expect me to confess it even to youTis dishonorablemost dishonorable she cried I could respect abrave soldier enemy but a spyThere was a clattering of hoofs in the street and a jingle ofswordscabbards on the doorstone I wheeled to face the newcomersdetermined now to front it boldly as a desperate man at bay But beforethe fumbling hands without could find the doorknob Margery was besideme all aflutter in a tremblingfit of excitementUp the stair quickly pour lamour de Dieu she whispered and wewere at the clock landing when the great door opened and some halfdozenkings officers came in We crouched together behind the balustrade tillthey should pass beyond the sight of us and in the group I marked a manstout and heavy built walking full solidly for his twoandforty yearsHe wore his own hair dressed high in front in the fashion first set forthe women by the Grand Monarques loosewife and as he passed under thecandles I saw that it was graying slightly His face highbrowedlongnosed doublechinned with the eyes womanish for bigness andmarked with brows that might have been penciled by the hairdresser Ihad seen before but lacking this present sight of it the orders onhis breast would have named him the ranking general of the army in thefieldLord Charles Cornwallis With all the houses in the town tochoose among I had blundered into thismy Lords own headquartersI had but a passing glimpse of the incoming group for when it was wellbeneath the turn of the stair my lady had me up and running againdriving me on before her to the chamber floor above along a dimlylighted corridor with many turnings and so to a culdesac in thesamea doorless passage with a high dormer window in the end and noother apparent means of egressMargery had snatched a candle from one of the corridor holders in theflight and now she bade me sit on the floor and draw my boots I didit shamefacedly enough being but a foul and ragged vagabond unfit tohave her come anigh me But I might have spared my blushings for she hadturned her back and was opening a secret door in the high wainscotBeyond the door lay a raftered garret half filled with castoff houselumber and lighted and aired by two high roof windows Into this she ledme with a finger on her lip for silence A hum of voices the clinkingof glass and now and again a hearty soldier laugh told me that mygarret was above some livingroom of the houseWhile I stood boots in hand she found a makeshift candlestick and ina trice had spread me a pallet on an ancient oaken settle big enough toserve for a choir stall in a cathedralYoull be safe here for the night if so be you will make no more noisethan a rat might make she whispered Mais mon Dieu tis aterrible risk How you will get off in the morning I do not knowLeave that to me I rejoined Then I remembered the portmanteau andthe promise that it should be sent hither Here was a furthercomplication and I must needs beg a boon of her A black boy willbring my portmanteau in the morning I have a decent desire to be hangedin clean clothing may I beg you toShe made a quick little gesture of impatience at the furthercomplication or at my boldness in asking I knew not which But herwhispered reply was of assent and then she turned to leave meAt that a sudden fierce desire to know why she had thus befriended mecame to throttle prudenceOne more word before you go Mistress Margery Will you tell me why youhave done this for the man who can serve you only by thrusting his neckinto the hangmans nooseShe was silent for a little space and I knew not what emotion it wasthat moved her to turn away and cover her face with her hands But whenshe spoke her voice was low and tremulous with pentup anger as IthoughtTruly Captain Ireton you have done a thing to make me hate youandmyself as well But I may not forget my duty sirAnd with this cruel word she was goneXXXIIIIN WHICH I HEAR CHANCEFUL TIDINGSYou are not to suppose that the hazards of this hiding place in my LordCornwalliss headquarters would keep me from sleeping well and soundlyOne of the things a soldier learns soonest is to take his rest when andas he can and after peering curiously into the nooks and corners of mygarret to make sure I was alone I flung myself asprawl on the broadsettle and was dropping off into forgetfulness when I heard a tapping atthe wainscotIt fetched me wide awake with a start and I was up and weaponedinstantlyhaving taken the precaution to lay my sword in easy reachbefore blowing out the candle Groping my way cautiously to the secretdoor I crouched and listened All was silent save for the intermittentclamor of the wassailers in the room beneath After waiting a fullminute I opened the door and looked without The high dormer window inthe end of the corridor made the darkness something less than visibleand I could see that the passage was empty But on the floor at my feetwas my supper a roasted fowl on a server hot from the spit withmaize bread and garnishings fit for an epicureSince as an appanage of Appleby Hundred this was mine own house andby consequence the fowl was mine I ate as a hungry man should makingno scruple on the score of pride Nor did I forget to be grateful to mylady though when I remembered that this was doubtless but another leafout of her dutybook the meat was like to choke me And it was thisthought that made me resolve thrice over to loose her from the onerousburden of me so soon as ever the morning light should come to help mefind the way out of my covert prisonNone the less for all my fine resolves to be astir and off by daybreakthe sun was shining broadly in at my garret window when I awokeSeeing the sun I tumbled out of my settlebed with a malediction onthe sloth that had bound me so fast and made for the door But some onehad been before me entering whilst I slept On a broken chair were abasin and ewer with soap and towels beside the chair was myportmanteau and on a deal box neatly covered with a linen cloth wasmy breakfastYou my dears who have your maid or man to tell you when your bath isready and to lay out the fresh clean garments sweet from thelaundering may wonder that I put away the thought of flight and let thebreakfast cool whilst I shaved and washed and scrubbed and doffed thevagabond and donned the gentleman I did it did it leisurely rollingthe privilege as a sweet morsel under my tongue They say the raimentnever makes the man tis a halftruth only For in his own regard atleast the man is vagabond or gentleman as he may dress the one part orthe other And I am sure of this that when I drew up another of thecastoff chairs to sit at meat freshly groomed and clad in the fielduniform of a captain of her Apostolic Majestys Hussars I was thefitter by many transmigrations to cope with fate or any other adversaryAnd now the claims of decency paid in full and the keen edge of hungersomewhat dulled I was free to think of my sweet ladys lovingkindnessto one she hatedand to wonder what she would do and be for one sheloved As you would guess there were dregs of bitterness in that cupand I was once again set sharp upon relieving her of the burden of meHaving my Austrian uniform I was now ready to move in that ventureoutlined in part to Colonel Davie but to set my plan in action I mustfirst get free of the house unseen by my Lord or any of his suite Howto do this unaided I could not determine and since any freshblundering would surely breed new trouble for Margery I was forced towait for her returnI made sure she would come if only to be the sooner quit of me and soshe did tapping at the wainscot door whilst I was dallying with thebreakfast leavings Twas worth something to see her start of surprisewhen I opened to her but she was far too true a lady to be one thingto the unwashed vagabond and another to the gentlemancladI gave her good morning and was beginning in some formal fashion tothank her for her thoughtful care when she cut me shortTis my bounden duty sir she said twanging once again upon thatfrayed string You are my guest and myhusband though God knows Iwould you were neitherMerci Madame said I stung so sharply that the retort would out inspite of everything As once before I am your poor misfortunatepensioner but this time you are not less willing to give than I am toreceiveShe gave me a look that I could not fathom and for a flitting instant Icould have sworn there was a mocking smile alurk at the back of thebeautiful eyes Then she went straight to the subjectmatter of hererrand brushing aside the small passage at arms as if it had not beenYou are in a most perilous situation Captain Ireton do you know itNews of your presence in Charlotte has got abroad and at this verymoment Tarletons dragoons are making a housetohouse search for youSo some one has betrayed meShe noddedDo you know who it wasShe nodded againI considered of it for a little time and then said I must not betaken here Will yourahduty stretch the length of showing me anunwatched doorThere are no doors unwatched You must stay here till nightfallNay that I will not Will you tell me who it was set them onTwas a man you hateand who hates you heartily in return He saw youcome here last night he knows you are here nowor guesses itI had no right to pry into her confidence as a thief would break into ahouse But I was loath to fight my battle in the dark if she or anyone could give me lightHis name if you may give it Mistress Margery It may point the wayout of this coilTis Owen Pengarvin He was here last night when you cameNow I remembered the little man in black whom I had seen coming down thestair whilst I knocked at the door But this left me in a greater mazethan everIf he knows I am here why does he let them search elsewhereAt this she looked away from me and I made sure I saw the sweet chinquiver when she spokeHe has reasons of his own reasons ofof but instead of telling mewhat they were she broke off to say But now you know why all the doorsof this house are under guardTruly said I and therewith I fell to pacing up and down the narrowclearway in the garret striving to see how I might come off withnothing worse than the loss of my burdensome lifeTwas easy to guess how this shaveling lawyer had discomfited meForewarned is forearmed in any soldier camp and through his blabbingthe plan by which I had hoped to lull resentment and forestall suspicionwas nipped in the bud I saw the farreaching consequences and was madeto know how a trapped rat will turn and fight in sheer desperationwhilst the terrier is shaking him to deathWhen that leaven began to work in me I was fit for the daringest thingthat offered so I paused to ask if my Lord Cornwallis were yet in thehouseHe is writing letters in his bedroom was her answerIf you will show me the way thither I shall be your poor debtor by thatmuch moreI will notunless you first tell me what you mean to do She said itfirmly but now I was fronting death and could be as firm as sheIf you will not show me the way I shall find it for myself So much Isaid but as for telling her that I meant to save his Lordship and allthe others the trouble of running me down I could not do thatYou are going to give yourself up she said and when I would not denyit she darted before me and set her back against the wainscot doorTis folly folly she cried He would but pull the bellcord andAnd give the order that Colonel Tarletons sentence be executed uponme you would say Be it so But in that event I can at least clear youand your father of any complicity in my hidingI say you shall not goWhat touch of savagery is it in a man that will not suffer him to let awoman loved or unloved stand in the last resort against his will Atany other time I would have pleaded with her would have ended mayhapby weakly deferring to her wish But nowwell you must remember mydears that I was the trapped rat I took her gently in my arms set heraside and stepped out into the corridorI looked for nothing less than a volcanoburst of righteous indignationto pay me out for this piece of tyranny But now as twice or thricebefore my lady showed me how little a man may know of a womans moodsYou need not be so masterful rough with me she said with a poutingof the sweet lips that set me back upon that thought of a wayward childwanting to be kissed If you say I must I am in duty bound to show youthe way And so she led on and I followed in a deeper maze than anyshe had ever set me inArrived at a pair of doors in the main passage she showed me the onethat opened to my Lords bedchamber and ran away ran with her hands toher face as if to shut out a sight which would not bear looking uponI turned my back stiffly upon this newer wonder pulled myself togetherand rapped on the door A voice within bade me enter the door openedunder my hand and I stood in the presence of the man who as I made nodoubt would shortly summon his guards and have me out to my rope andtreeXXXIVHOW I MET A GREAT LORD AS MAN TO MANThe room in which I found myself was the guestchamber furnishedluxuriously for that day and place in Frenchfashioned mahogany andgilt The bed was high and richly canopied as befitted a peers restingplace there was a square of Turkish drugget on the floor a cheerfulfire burning in the chimney arch and on the small table whereat theoccupant of the guestroom had lately breakfasted a goodly display ofthe Ireton silverMy Lord was busy at his writingdesk when I entered but when he lookedup I saw the light of instant recognition in his eye Never I thinkdid another prisoner at the bar strive harder to read his sentence inhis judges eyes than I did in that moment of suspense I liked not muchthe look he gave me but his greeting was affable and kindly enoughAh Captain Ireton tis you is it We are well met at last Theytold me you were gone to join the rebels did they notHere was an opening for a bold man and in a flash I came to therightabout choked down the defiance I had meant to hurl at him andtook quick counsel of cool audacityIndeed my Lord I know not what they have told you In times past theking had no truer soldier than I and when I came across seas twas notto fight against him But that I have not joined the rebels is no faultof certain of your Lordships officersSay you so But how is this Surely I am not mistaken I could becertain Colonel Tarleton reported your taking as a spy and his tryingof you And was there not something about a rescue at the last moment bya band of these border bravos But stay let us have the colonels storyat first hands Have the goodness to ring the bell for me will youCaptainThe crisis was come A pull at the bellcord would summon the guard andthe guard would be sent after Colonel Tarleton Well said the demonDespair tis time you were gone to make room for Richard Jennifer andI laid a hand upon the tasseled rope But when I would have rung allthe manpride of race and of soldier training rose up to bid me fightfor space to strike one good blow in freedoms cause by way ofleavetakingSo as it had been an afterthought I said A word further with youfirst my Lord and then if you please I will call the guard All youremember is true save as to the principal fact So far from being a spyin intent or even a partizan of either side I was at the time butnewly come into the province knowing little of the cause of quarrel andcaring still less But Captain Falconnet and Colonel Tarleton did theirearnest best to make a rebel of me out of handAh But the proof of all this Captain IretonThe best I can offer is the present fact of my coming to place myselfat your Lordships disposal being moved thereto by your Lordships owndesire expressed in an order sent some weeks since to Sir FrancisFalconnetSothen you knew of that orderCaptain Falconnet showed it to me after I was condemned and the firingsquad was drawn up to snuff me outMy Lord Charles gave me the courtier smile that so endeared him to hissoldiershe was wellloved of his menand bade me sitThe plot thickens as Mr Richardson would say Let me have your storyCaptain Ireton I would rejoice to know why Captain Sir FrancisFalconnet saw fit to disobey his ordersI was clear of the lee shore and the breakers at last but I was fain tobelieve that not Machiavelli himself could hope to weather the storm inthe open How much or how little did Lord Cornwallis remember of ColonelTarletons report How explicit had that report beenwas there anymention in it of my eavesdropping at the conference between Captain JohnStuart and the baronet of my attempt to warn the overmountain menagainst the Indianarming Could I hope to tell his Lordship a tale sonear the truth as to be unassailable by Tarleton and his officers byGilbert Stair and the spiteful little pettifogger and yet so deftlygarbled as to keep my neck out of the halter for the time beingAll these questions thronged upon me as a mob to pull cool reason fromher seat and I could only play the part of the trapped rat and snapback at them Yet my Lord Cornwallis was waiting for his answer and asingle moments hesitation might breed suspicionYou must forgive me my dears if I confess it beyond me to set downhere in measured words the tale I told his Lordship A lie is a lie beit told in never so good a cause a thing deplorable and not to beglozed over or boasted of after the fact So I beg you to let thesequibblings to which I was driven rest in oblivion figuring toyourselves that I used all the truth I dared and that I strove throughit all not wholly to sink the gentleman and the man of honor in the spyTwas but a bridge of glass when all was said a bridge that carried mesafely over for the moment into my Lords confidence yet one which apebble flung by any one of a dozen hands might shiver in the dropping ofan eyelidTruly you have had a most romantic experience said his Lordshipwhen I had made an end Then he lay back in his chair and laughed tillthe stout body of him shook again And all about a little wench of theprovincials Well well Sir Francis was always a sad dog with thewomen But all this was in the early summer you say where have youbeen sinceHere was a chance for more romancing this time of a sort lessdangerous So I drew breath and plunged again telling how I had beencarried off by my captorrescuers how I had fallen into the hands ofthe Indiansnot all of whom I would remind his Lordship were friendlyto the king and lastly how I had but lately escaped from the mountainfastnesses back of Major Fergusons camp at Gilbert Town At this pointmy Lord interrupted the taletellingSo you know of the major and his doings I would you had brought melate news of him Tis a week since his last courier reached usThis was the moment for the playing of my trump cardthe only one Iheld I rose bowed took from my pocket that other letter given me byColonel Davie and handed it to his Lordship Twas Major Fergusons lastreport intercepted by one of Davies vigilant scouting partiesAh said my Lord and I strolled to the window whilst he read theletterWhen I turned to front him again he was all affability and I knew I wassafefor the time at leastThe major commends you highly as a good man and a true CaptainIreton he said and truly the letter did contain a warmheartedcommendation of the bearer whose name for safetys sake wasomitted and not only this but the writer desired to have his man backagain Then my Lord added You are here to take your old service againI assumeI hesitated There be things that even a spy may balk at and the takingof the oath of allegiance to the other side I conceived to be one ofthem So I saidI have worn many uniforms since I doffed that of King George my LordandHe laughed cheerily But me no buts Captain Ireton once anEnglishman always an Englishman you know I shall assign you to dutyin my own familyAt this I made a bold stroke Let it be then as an officer of herApostolic Majestys service and your Lordships guest for the timeBelieve me it is thus I may best serve yourahthe causeAs how he would askI smiled and touched the braided jacket of my hussar uniformAs an Austrian officer on a tour of observation in the campaign I maygo and come where others may not and see and hear things which yourLordship may wish to know Does your Lordship take meHe laughed and rose and clapped me on the shoulderYou may call the guard now Captain and I will turn you overnot to afiring squad but to the tender mercies of our old rascal host who is atrimmer of the devils own school If he tries to screw a pennys payout of you as he is like to put him in arrestIt is your Lordships meaning that I should be quartered herein thishouse I gaspedAnd why not Ah my good Captain of Hussars I have made you myhonorary aidedecamp and a member of my family so that I may keep aneye on you ComprenezvousHe said it with a laugh and another hearty handclap on my shoulder andI would fain take it for a jest Yet there be playful gibes that hint atgibbets and I may confess to you here my dears that I left my Lordspresence with the conviction that my acquittal was but a reprieveconditioned upon the best of future good behavior So it took anotherturn of the audacity screw to tune me up for the battle royal withGilbert Stair and the pettifogger Owen PengarvinXXXVIN WHICH I FIGHT THE DEVIL WITH FIREWith the house guard for a guide I found my host in a boxlike den belowstairs a room with a writingtable two chairs and a great ironstrongbox for its scanty furnishingsThe old man was sitting at the table when I looked in his long noseburied in a musty parchment deed The light from the single small windowwas none too good but it sufficed to help him recognize me at a glancedespite the hussar uniform In a twinkling he put the breadth of theoaken table between us hurled the parchment deed into the openstrongbox slammed to the cover and gave a shrill alarmHo you devils without there Here he isI have him Help MurderThe guard a burly bearded Darmstdter turned on his heel and stood atattention in the doorway looking stolidly for his orders not to theshrilling master of the house but to the man who wore a uniformTis naught I said speaking in German He mistakes me for arittmeister of the rebels Verstehen SieThe soldier saluted wheeled and vanished and I sat down to wait tillthe old mans outcry should pause for lack of breath When my chancecame I saidCalm yourself Mr Stair You are in no present danger greater thanthat which you may bring upon yourself Blot out all the past if youplease and consider me now as a member of Lord Cornwalliss militaryfamily seeking quarters in your house by my Lords express commandQuarters in my houseyere a damned rebel spy he cried Illdenounce ye to my Lord for what ye are Ho ye rascals I sayPeace I commanded sternly this is but childs folly No man in theBritish army would arrest me at your behest Ring the bell and summonyour factor lawyer I would have a word or two in private with both ofyouHe dropped into a chair and I could see the sweat standing in greatbeads on his wrinkled foreheadD yed ye mean to kill us both he gaspedNot if I can help it But some better understanding is needful and wewill have it here and now once for all Will you ring or shall IHe made no move to reach the bellcord and I rang for him A grinningblack boy came to the door and seeing that Mr Gilbert Stair was beyondgiving the order I gave it myselfFind Master Pengarvin and send him here quickly Tell him Mr Stairwants himThere was a short interval of waiting and then the lawyer came Beingbut a little wisp of a man all malignance and no courage he would havefled when he saw me But I caught him by the collar and sent himscurrying around the table to keep his master companyNow then how much or how little have you two blabbed of the doings atAppleby Hundred some weeks since I demanded Speak out and quicklyTwas the lawyer who obeyed and now he was the trapped rat to snapblindly in despairYou will hang higher than Haman when the dragoons find you he grittedoutOn your informationOn mine and Mr StairsYe lie shrieked the miser I tellt ye to keep hands off yebletherin little deevil yeNever mind said I whats done is done But it must be undone andthat swiftly and thoroughly Lie out of it to Colonel Tarleton and theothers as you will Captain John Stuart and the baronet are not here tocontradict you and you are the only witnesses Knock together somestory that will hold water and lose no time about it Do youunderstandSeeing he was not to be put to the wall and spitted on the spot thelawyer recovered himselfTis not the criminal at the bar who dictates terms Captain Iretonhe said with his hateful smirk You are under sentence of death andthat by a court lawful enough in war timeYou refuse I saidHe shruggedSpeaking for myself I shall leave no stone unturned to bring you tobook Captainwhen it suits my purposeI was loath to go to extremities with either of them but my bridge ofglass must be defended at all hazardsYou would best reconsider Mr Pengarvin At this present moment I amof my Lord Cornwalliss military family and I have his confidence Aword from me will put you both in arrest as persons whose loyalty intimes past has been somewhat more than blown uponBah said the pettifogger Bluster is a good dog but Holdfast is thebetter You can prove nothing as you well know Moreover with your ownneck in a noose you dare not mess and meddle with other mens affairsDare not you say Ill tell you what I may dare Master Attorney Ifyou are not disposed to meet me half way in this matter I shall go tomy Lord tell him how I have been cheated out of my estate declare themarriage with Mistress Margery and see that you get your just desertsAnd you may rest assured that this soldierearl will right me come whatmayTwas a bold stroke the boldest of any I had made that morning but Iwas wholly unprepared for its effect upon the lawyer His rage was likethat of some venomous little animal a thing to make an onlooker shudderand draw backNever he hissed never I say Ill kill her firstIll Hechoked in the very exuberance of his malignance and his face was likethe face of a man in a fitTwas then that I saw the pointing of his villainy and knew what Margeryhad meant when she said that for reasons of his own he was holding mybetrayal in abeyance He was Falconnets successor and my rival Thislittle reptile aspired to be the master of my fathers acres and thehusband of my dear lady And his holding off from denouncing me at oncewas also explained Taking it for granted that the wife would bargainfor the husbands life he had made a whip of his leniency to flogMargery into subjectionMy determination was taken upon the instant There was no safety forMargery whilst this plotting pettifogger was at large and I stepped tothe door and called the sentry The Darmstdter came back and I pointedto the lawyer Then indeed the furious little madman found his tongueand shrilled out his defianceCurse you he yelled Ill be quits with you for this Master SpyTis your hearing now but mine will come and you shall hang like adog Ill follow you to the ends of the earthIllI made a sign and the soldier brought his musket into play and prickedhis prisoner with the bayonet in token that time pressed So we were ridof the lawyer in bodily presence though I could hear his snarlings andspittings as the big Darmstdter ran him out at the bayonets pointDuring this tilt between his factor and me Mr Gilbert Stair had stoodapart watchful but trembling When we were alone I saidNow Mr Stair I shall trouble you to billet me somewhere in yourhouse as a member of my Lords family Lead on if you please and IllfollowHe went before me without a word out of the little den and up the broadstair doddering like a man grown ten years older in a breath andcatching at the balustrade to steady himself as we ascended The room hegave me was at an angle in one of the crookings of the corridor andpointing me to the door he went pottering away still without a word ora look behind himThe door was on the latch but it gave reluctantly letting me insuddenly when I set my shoulder to it There was a quick little cryhalf of anger half of affright from within I drew back hastily witha muttered curse upon the old mans spite and in the act my spur caughtthe door and slammed it shut behind meFor reasons known only to Omniscience and to himself Gilbert Stair hadshown me to my ladys chamber she was standing with her bodice offbefore the oval mirror on the high dressing caseXXXVIHOW I RODE POST ON THE KINGS BUSINESSIf a look might be a levenstroke to do a man to death I warrant you myladys flashing eyes would have crisped me to a cinder where I stoodfumbling with one hand behind me for the latch of the slammed doorScorn indignation outraged maiden modesty all these thrust at me likeairdrawn daggers and it needed not her Fie for shame CaptainIretonand you would call yourself a gentleman to set me afire withprinklings of abashmentWhat could I say or do The accursed doorlatch would not find itself tolet me fly and as for excusings I could not tell her that her ownfather had thrust me thus upon her Yet had she let me be I hope Ishould have had the wit to find the door fastening and the grace to runaway in truth I had the latch in hand when she lashed out at me againand my tingling shame began to give place to that masterdevil ofpassion which is never more than half whipped into subjection in thebest of usHow are you better than the man you warned me of she cried Andthen in a tempest of grief Oh you would not leave me the respect Ibore you you must even rob me of that to fling it down and trample itunder footFigure to yourselves my dears that I was wholly blameless in thisunhappy breaking and entering and so mayhap you may find excuse forme For now though I could have gone I would not Her glorious beautyheightened beyond compare by the passionate outburst held mespellbound And at my ear the masterdevil whispered She is your weddedwife yours for better or worse till death part you Who has a betterright to look upon her thusSo it was that the lovemadness came upon me again and that thinveneering wherewith the Christian centuries have so painfully overlaidthe natural man in us was cracked and riven and the barbarian whichlies but skindeep underneath bestirred himself and winked and blinkedhimself awake in giant might as did the primal man when he rose up tolook about him for his mateBefore I knew what I would do I was beside her and honor or what maystand therefor betwixt a man and his friend was flung away But when Iwould have crushed her sweetness in my arms she went upon her knees tome Ah God she knelt to me as she had knelt to that other wouldberavisher and begged me for mine own honors sake to bethink me of what Iwould doOh Monsieur John be merciful as you are strong she pleaded Thinkwhat it will mean to you and how you will loathe me and yourself aswell when this madness is overpast Oh go go quickly lest I tooforgetAnd so it was that I found sudden strength to turn and leave herkneeling there turned to grope blindly for the door with all the painsof hell aflame within meFor now I had put honor under foot now I knew that I had truly earnedher scorn and loathing I could no longer plead that I was the puppet offate flung against my will between this maiden and my dear lad I wasthe wilful offender false to my love false to my friend a recreant toevery oath wherewith I had bound myself to be true and loyal to thesetwoWith such a flaming sword to drive me forth I stumbled from the roomthinking only how I should quickest rid me of myself Hastening to mygarret sleepingplace I buckled on my sword found my shako and wentstraight to my Lords bedchamber My rap at the door went unansweredand a broadshouldered young fellow in a lieutenants uniform loungingon a settle in the clock landing of the stair told me Lord Cornwalliswas gone outI was face to face with this young lieutenant before I recognized himbeing so bent upon haste I should have passed him on the landing withouta second glance had he not risen to grip me by the shouldersBy the Lord Harry he cried is it thus you pass an old friendwithout a word Captain IretonTwas my good deathwatch that Lieutenant Tybee of the lighthorse whohad sunk the British officer in the man in that trying night at ApplebyHundred I returned his hearty greeting as well as I might and wouldhave explained my present state and standing but that I was loath to lieto him But as to this he saved me the shame of itI could have sworn you were no rebel Captain Ireton indeed I madebold to say as much to our colonel after it was all over I told him asoft word or two would have won you back to your old service You see Iknew better than the others what lay beneath all your madnesses thatnightYou knew somewhat but not all I said and thereupon lest he shouldinvolve me deeper and detain me longer when I was athirst to be gone Ihastened to ask where I might hope to find his Lordship and ColonelTarletonTis the hour for parade you will find them at the camp he repliedAnd then out of the honest English heart of him Have you made yourpeace Captain Do you need a friend to go with youI said I had been granted a hearing by Lord Cornwallis but a littlewhile before that by my Lords appointment I was now a sort of honoraryaidedecampGood said the lieutenant gripping my hand in a way to make me wincefor the lieineffect hidden in the simple statement of fact Then heroared at the soldier standing guard at the house door below A mountfor Captain Iretonand be swift about itHe held me in talk till the horse was fetched happily doing most of thetalking himself and when I was in the saddle gave me a heartyGodspeed Being so sick with selfdespisings I fear I made but a poorreturn for all this good comradeship but at the time I could think ofnothing but the hell that flamed within me and of how I could soonestquench the fires of itThe town which I had not seen since early summer was but littlechanged by the British occupation save in the livening of it by thenearathand camp of an armed host Being but a haltpoint en route inthe northward march it was not fortified indeed for the matter ofthat the camp proper was a little way without the town as I have saidI rode slowly across the common skirting the commissarys quarters andmaking mental notes of all I saw this from soldier habit solely for atthe time I had little thought of living on to make a spys use of themArrived at the parade ground I found my Lord galloping through thelines on inspection and so I must draw rein in the background and waitmy opportunityThe pause gave space for some eyesweep of the scene and all thesoldier blood in me was stirred by the sight the first I had had inmany a day of a wellordered army fit disciplined machinedrilledto move like the parts of a wondrous mechanismAt the back of Lord Cornwallis and his galloping suite Tarletonsfamous lighthorse legion was drawn up and fronting it was theinfantry rank on rank the glittering bayonets slanting in the Octobersunlight as the regiments moved into place or standing in rigid grovesof steel at the command to halt and port armsWhat was there in all our poor raw land to stand against thiswelltrained host armedas we were notwith the deadly bayonet andmoving as one man at the word of command Not the bravest home guard ormilitia troop I thought and this seeing of what he had had to front onthe field of Camden made me think less scornfully of Horatio GatesRiding presently around the field to be the nearer to the general whenmy time should come I missed the mark completely It so chanced that asthe parade was ended my Lord and his suite were at the extreme rightand when the regiments broke ranks I was forced to skirt the entire campto come into the road By this time those I sought were gone into thetown so I must needs turn about and follow with the thing I had to saystill unspokenI need not drag you back and forth with me on the search I made to findLord Cornwallis again Tis enough to say that after missing him hereand there I ran him to earth at the court house where it was toldme my Lord was sitting in council with his staff officersThinking it worse than useless to try to force my way into the councilchamber I waited in the raff of soldiery without cursing the delaywhich gave my despairing resolution time to cool When I had closed thedoor of my dear ladys chamber behind me I was resolved to fling myselfupon that fate which needed but a word from me to make my calling andelection to a gibbet swift and sure Had I found my Lord Cornwallis inhis bedroom the word would have been spoken but now the iron ofresolution cooled in spite of meTwas not that I was less willing to pay the price of expiation thatmust be done in any case But I had seen the enemy and all the soldierin me rebelled at the thought of dying like a noosed bullock in theshambles Could I but strike that one good blowThe old court house of our greater Mecklenburg was such as some of youmay remember a stout wooden building raised upon brick pillars to leavea story underneath In the time of the British occupation this lowerstory served as a market house and the public entrance to the courtroom above was reached by steps on the outside In my boyhood days thisouter stair was the only one but now in wandering aimlessly through themarketplace beneath I found another flight in a corner the jurystair they called it since it provided the means of egress from thejury box aboveThe sight of this inner stair set me plotting Could I make use of it tocome unseen into the council chamber of Lord Cornwallis and hisofficersThe marketplace was well thronged with venders and soldier buyers thepatriotic Mecklenburgers were not averse to the turning of an honestpenny upon the needs of their oppressors as it seemed I watched mychance and when there were no prying eyes to mark it made the dash upthe stepsHappily for the success of the adventure there was an angle in thenarrow stair to hide me whilst I lifted the trap door in the courtroomfloor a scant halfinch and got my bearings As I had hoped the trapopened behind the jury box and I was able to raise it cautiously and soto draw myself up into the room above unseen and unheardA peep around the corner of the high jury stalls showed me my Lord andhis suite gathered about the lawyers table in front of the bar Of thestaff I recognized only Stedman the commissarygeneral Tarletonlooking something the worse for his late illness Major Hanger hissecond in command and the young Irishman Lord RawdonAt the moment of my espial Cornwallis was speaking and I drew back tolisten well enough content to be in earshot For if my good angel hadtimed my coming I could not have arrived at a more opportune momentWhat we have to consider now is how best to reach Ferguson with anexpress instantly his Lordship was saying This rising of theovermountain men is likely to prove a serious matternot only for themajor but for the kings cause in the two provinces Lacking positiveorders to the contrary Ferguson will fightwe all know that and if heshould be defeated twill hopelessly undo his work among the borderloyalists and set us back another twelvemonthThen your Lordship will order him to come in with what he has said avoice which I knew for Colonel TarletonsInstanter had I a sure man to sendPshaw I can find you a hundred amongst the late royalist recruitsTwas young Lord Rawdon who said thisDamn them said his Lordship shortly I would sooner trust this newaide of mine He comes straight from the major and can find his way backagainTarleton laughed I fear we shall never agree upon him my Lord I knownot how he has made his peace with you but I do assure you he is asgreat a rascal as ever went unhung Tis true as you say I did not gointo the particulars but were Captain Stuart or Sir Francis Falconnethere either of them would convince your Lordship in a twinklingThere was silence for a little space following the colonelsdenunciation of me and then my Lord broke it to say I may not be socredulous as you think Colonel Rebel spy or trueblue loyalist he issafe enough for the present In the meantime in this matter of reachingFerguson we may make good use of himIn what manner your Lordship asked one whose voice I did notrecognizeHe has come straight from Major Ferguson as I say and loyalist orrebel he can find his way back to Gilbert TownBut youll never be trusting him with despatches said Lord RawdonThere is no need to trust him He can be given the despatches with somehint of their purport and of how much the kings cause will profit bytheir safe deliveryAgain a silence fell upon the group around the lawyers table and thensome onetwas Major Hanger as I thoughtsaid Tis an unread riddlefor me as yet my LordCornwallis laughed Where are your wits this morning gentlemen If hebe loyal and true the despatches will go safe enough If on the otherhand he be a rebel and a spy he will doubtless tamper with them butin that case he will none the less ride straight enough to MajorFergusons headquarters in the WestHm your Lordship is still too deep for me said Tarletons second incommand If he be a rebel and a spy why in Gods name should hecarry your Lordships letters to any but some ragtag colonel of his ownkidneyMy Lord laughed again Truly Major you should go to a dames schooland learn diplomacy If we tell him beforehand what our object is howcould any rebel of them all defeat it more surely than by going toFerguson with a garbled message that would make him stand and fight alosing battleBut my Lordthe risk cut in the commissarygeneralThere need be none An hour after he sets out we shall send a mounteddetail after him with an Indian tracker to nose out his trail Thelieutenant in command will carry duplicate despatches At the worstIreton will guide these followers to Fergusons rendezvous and so faras we know he is the only man who knows exactly where to find themajorI had heard enough Under cover of the chorus of bravos raised by LordCornwalliss explication of his plot within a plot I lifted thetrapdoor and made my exit as noiselessly as I had comeGuessing that no time would be lost in putting the plan into action Imade haste to be found inquiring hither and yon for thecommanderinchief when my Lord and his suite came down the outer stairand when we were met I was quickly told of my assignment to courierdutyMake your preparations to take the road within the hour and report tome at Friend Stairs said my Lord most affably We shall put yournewfound loyalty to the test Captain Ireton by entrusting you with amost important mission Go with the commissarygeneral and he will findyou your mount and equipmentThus dismissed I went with Stedman and was accorded a more gentlemanlywelcome than my overhearings had given me leave to expectOn the way to the horse paddock the commissarygeneral told me of hisplan to write a history of the campaign a bit of confidence which setme laughing inwardly and wondering if he would put one John Iretonsometime of the Scots Blues and late captain in her Apostolic MajestysHussars between the covers of his book Tis small wonder that he didnot I have since had the pleasure of reading his history of the greatwar and I find it curiously lacking in those incidents which did notredound to the honor and glory of the kings cause and army in thefieldNot to digress however my makeshift mount was soon exchanged for abetter I was allowed to draw what I would of accoutrements andprovender from the kings stores and so to cut it short I waspresently at the door of my Lords headquarters fully equipped and readyfor the roadI did hope in those last few moments that I might have a chance toexchange a word with my dear lady might ask her forgiveness orfailing so much grace of her might at least have another sight of hersweet faceBut even this poor boon was denied me I was scarce out of the saddlewhen an aide came to conduct me to the general and I saw no one in thehouse save my Lord himselfAs you would guess my instructions conformed exactly to the planoutlined by Lord Cornwallis in the council I was entrusted with asealed packet for delivery to Major Ferguson and for safetys sake asmy Lord explained I was given the meat of the message to deliververbally should the need arise Ferguson was to be ordered to come ininstantly by forced marches if necessary and he was on no account torisk a battle with the overmountain menYou may be sure my dears that I scarce drew breath till I was ahorseand out of the town and galloping hard on the road to that ford ofMaster Macgowans which afterward became famous in our history under themisspelling Cowans Ford Twas too good to be true that I should bethrust thus into the very gaping mouth of opportunity and now and againI would feel the packet buttoned tight beneath my hussar jacket to makesure twas not a dream to vanish at a touchIn the mad joy of it the spirit of prophecy came upon me and I saw asif the thing were done how at last I held the fate of the patriot causein all our west country in the hollow of my handXXXVIIOF WHAT BEFELL AT KINGS CREEKSkipping lightly over the happenings of the two days following mydeparture from Charlotte on the kings errand I may say that afterpassing the British outposts at the crossing of the Catawba I metneither friend nor foe and from noon on I rode to the westward througha pitiless drizzling rain splashed to the belt with the mire of theroad and having little chance to inquire my wayThis last lack grew with the passing hours to the size of a threateninghazard As you may have guessed I knew no more than a blind man theroute I should take knew no more of the whereabouts of Gilbert Town andMajor Fergusons rendezvous than that both were some eighty miles to thewestwardAt the outset I had thought to feel out the way in general by cautiousinquiry along the road but when I came to consider of this the risk ofbetraying my ignorance to those who followed me was too great to let meturn aside to any of the wayside houses and as for chance passersbythere were nonethe rain kept all within doorsSo I was constrained to gallop on without pause and throughout thatcomfortless afternoon and the scarce less miserable day which followedthere were no incidents to break the dull monotony of the blind racesave these two that once the clouds lifted enough to give me a glimpseof my pursuers in a far reach to the eastward and once again I had asight of an awkward horseman in the road before mesaw him and tried toovertake him and could not for all his clumsy ridingNow I was curious about this lone horseman ahead for more reasons thanone but chiefly because my glimpse of him seemed to show me the back ofa man whom I made sure I had left safe behind in the British guardhousein Charlotte to wit the scoundrelly little pettifoggerAt first I scoffed at the idea Saying he were free to leave Charlottehow should he be riding post on my haphazard road to the westward Twasagainst all reason and yet the tittuping figure of which I had but arainveiled glimpse named itself Owen Pengarvin in spite of all thereasons I could bring to bearTwas close on eventide of the second day the early evening gloaming ofa chill autumnal rainday and I had been since morning dubiously lostin the somber trackless forest when an elfish cry rose as it wouldseem from beneath the very hoofs of my horseGod save the kingThe bay shied suddenly standing with nostrils aquiver and I had tolook closely to make out the little brown dot of humanity clad in russethomespun crouching in the path its childish eyes wide with fear and itslips parted to shrill again God save the kingI threw a stiff leg over the cantle and swung down to go on one knee tomy stout challenger I can never make you understand my dears how thesight of this helpless waif appearing thus unaccountably in the heart ofthe great forest mellowed and softened me Twas a little maid notabove three or four years old and with a face that Master Raphael mighthave taken as a pattern for one of his seraphsWhat know you of the king little one I askedGrandad told me she lisped If I was to see a soldierman I mustsay quick God save the king or haps hed eat me Isis youhungry Mister SoldiermanTruly I am that sweetheart but I dont eat little maids Where isyour grandfatherAint got any granfavver I said grandadWell your grandad then can you take me to himI dont know Haps youd eat himNo fear of that my dear Do I look as if I ate peopleShe gave me a long scrutiny out of the innocent eyes and then put up twolittle brown hands to be taken I tired she said and my sore heartwent warm within me when I took her in my arms and cuddled her After alongdrawn sigh of contentment she said My name Polly whats yoursYou may call me Jack if you pleaseCaptain Jack if that comes theeasier And now will you let me take you to your grandadShe nodded and I spoke to the bay and mounted still holding herclosely in my armsTell me quickly which way to go Polly I said for besides being asI would fear far out of the way to Gilbert Town the last hilltop tothe rear had given me another sight of my shadowing pursuers riding hardas if they meant to overtake meThe little maid sat up straight on the saddle horn and looked about heras if to get her bearingsThat way she said pointing short to the right and I wheeled thehorse into a blind path that wound in and out among the trees for a longhalf mile to end at a little clearing on the banks of a small streamIn the midst of the clearing was a rude log cabin and in the opendoorway stood a man bent and aged a patriarchal figure with white hairfalling to his shoulders and a snowy beard such as Aaron might haveworn At sight of me the old watcher disappeared within the house but amoment later he was out again fingering the lock of an ancientQueensarmI drew rein quickly and the little maid sat up and saw the musketDont shoot grandad she cried Hes Cappy Jack and he doesnteat folksesAt this the old man came to meet us though still with the clumsy musketheld at the readyThese be parlous times sir he said half in apology I thought Andthen You have made friends with my little maid and I owe you somewhatfor bringing her safe homeNay said I the debt is mine inasmuch as I have the little one formy friend Tis long since I have held a trusting child in my arms I doassure you sirHe bowed as grandly as any courtier I hope her trust is not misplacedsir though for the matter of that we have little enough now to take orleaveYou have given it all to the king said I feeling my way as I hadneed toHis eyes flashed and he drew himself up proudlyThe king has taken all sir as you see this with a wave of the handto point me to the forlorn homestead There is naught left me save thispoor hut and my little maidTaken you say Then you are not of the kings sideHe came a step nearer and faced me boldly Listen sir two of my sonswere left on the bloody field of Camden and the butcher BanastreTarleton slew the other two at Fishing Creek A month since a band ofroving savages armed with King Georges muskets mind you sir camedown upon us at Northby and this little maids motherHe stopped and choked and the child looked up into my face with herblue eyes full of nameless terror Oh I want my mammy she saidWont you find her for me Cappy JackI slipped from the saddle still clasping the little one tightly in myarmsEnough sir I said when I could trust myself to speak This sameKing Georges minions have made me a homeless outcast too I live butto give some counter stroke if I mayHa said the old man starting back then you are for our side Butyour uniformIs that of an Austrian officer my good sir which I should rightgladly exchange for the buff and blue but that I can serve the causebetter in thisHe dropped the Queensarm took the child from me and bade me welcometo his cabin and all it held But I was not minded to make him a sharerin my private perilNo said I Tell me how I may find Gilbert Town and Major Fergusonsrendezvous and I will ride whilst I can see the wayHe looked at me narrowly Ferguson left Gilbert Town some days sinceIf tis the place you seek you are gone far out of your way if tisthe manTis the man I cut in hastilyThe patriarch shook his headIf you be of our side as you say he will hang you out of handSo I can make my errand good I care little how soon he hangs meAnd what may your errand be Mayhap I can help youIt is to bring him to a stand till the mountain men can overtake himThe old man trembled with excitement like a boy going into his firstbattleAh if you couldif you could he cried But tis too late nowListen his present camp is but three miles to the westward on BuffaloCreek I was there no longer ago than the Wednesday II made mysubmission to himcurse himso that I might mayhap learn of his plansHe told me all how that now he was safe that the mountaineers weregone off from the fording of the Broad on a false scent that Tarletonwith four hundred of the legion would soon be marching to his reliefI stole away when I could and that night took horse and rode twentymiles to Tom Sumters camp at Flint Hillall to little purpose I fearPoor Tom is still desperately sick of his Fishing Creek wounds andColonel Lacey was the only officer fit to go after Shelby and themountain men to set them straight I should have gone myself butStay my good friend said I you go too fast for me If Ferguson isstill out of communication with the main at Charlotte we may halt himyetThe old man made a gesture of impatienceTis a thing done because it is as good as done The major will breakcamp and march tomorrow morning and he can reach Charlotte at ease intwo days What with their losing of his trail the mountain men arethose same two days behind himNone the less we shall halt him said I Have you ever an inkhornand a quill in your cabinBoth at your service sir But I can not understandWe may call it the little maids judgment on those who have made herfatherless But for her stopping of me I should have come unpreparedinto the camp of the enemy I am the bearer of a letter from LordCornwallis to this same Major FergusonYoua bearer of Lord Cornwalliss despatches The old man put ablades length between us and held the little one aloft as if he fearedI might do her a mischief I laughed and bade him be comfortedTis a long story and I may not take the time to tell it now But aword will suffice Like yourself I made my submissionand for the samepurpose My Lord accepted it and made me his despatchbearer because hethought I knew the way to Ferguson when no one else knew it But enoughof this time presses Let me have ink and the quillThe old man led the way into the cabin and put his writing tools at mydisposal Left to myself I should have broken the seal of the packetbut my wise old ally cool and collected now showed me how to split thepaper beneath the wax Opened and spread before us on the rude slabtable the letter proved to be the briefest of military commands aperemptory order to Ferguson to rejoin the main body at once proceedingby forced marches if needful and on no account to risk engagement withthe overmountain menHow to change such an order to reverse it in effect I knew no more thana yokel but here again my ancient ally showed himself a man of partsDressing the pen to make it the fellow of that used by my LordCornwallis he scanned the handwriting of the letter closely made a fewpractice pothooks to get the imitative hang of it and wrote thispostscriptum at the bottom of the sheet    Since writing the foregoing I have your courier and his    despatches Lieutenantcolonel Tarleton with four hundred of the    legion will take the road for you tonight If battle is forced    upon you make a stand and hold the enemy in check till    reinforcements come    CornwallisThe old man sanded the wet penstrokes and bade me say if it would serveTwas a most beautiful forgery My Lords crabbed handwriting was copiedto a nicety and of the two signatures I doubt if the earl himself couldhave told which was his own twas the same circle C the sameprinting r the same heavy precision throughoutCapital said I Now if the lightning would but strike thesepursuers of mine we should have the Scotsman at bay in a hands turnHow said the patriarch are you followedI told him I was told him of my Lords plot within a plotthat threelighthorse riders one of them a lieutenant bearing duplicatedespatches had been hard upon my heels all the way from CharlotteAt this the old warhorseI learned afterward that he had fought throughthe French and Indian warwagged his beard and his eye flashedWe must stop them he said Three of them do you sayThree white men and an Indian trailerHa If it were not for the little maid Let me thinkHe fell to pacing up and down before the fire on the hearth and I tookthe small one on my knee to let her chatter to me Twas five fullminutes before my ancient gave me the worth of his cogitations but whenhe did speak it was much to the purposeThese marplot rearguards of yours will spoil it all if they come toFergusons camp either before or after you Do they know the majorspresent whereaboutsNo more than I did an hour ago As I take it they are depending on meto show them the wayWell then dead men tell no talesBut my good friend you forget there are four of them and only two ofus We should stand little chance with them in fair fightAgain the old mans eyes snapped and glowed as if pentfires were behindthemWas it fair fight when Tarletons men rode in upon Tom Sumters restcamp at Fishing Creek and cut down this little maids father whilst hewas naked and bathing in the stream Was it fair fight when KingGeorges Indian devils came down in the dead of night upon ourdefenseless house at Northby Never talk to me of fairness sir whilstall this bloody tyranny is afootI thought upon it for a little space Twas none so easy to decide Onone hand stern loyalty to the cause I had espoused passed instantsentence on these four men whose lives stood in the way on the othercommon humanity cried out and called it murderNever smile my dears and hint that I had found me a new heart of mercysince that ambushkilling of the three Cherokee peacemen in the lonevalley of the western mountains We did but give the savages a dole outof their own store of cruel cunning and ferocity But as for these mytrackers three of them at least were soldiers and men of my own raceI could not do itNo said I firmly These followers of mine must be stopped as yousay else there is no need of my going on But there must be nobutchers workThe patriarch frowned and wagged his beard againA true patriot should hold himself ready to give his own life or takeanothers quoth heTruly and I am most willing on both heads But we have had enough andmore than enough of midnight massacreWhere this argument would have led us in the end I know not since wewere both waxing warm upon it But in the midst the little maid camerunning from the open door her blue eyes wide in childish terrorInjun man was all she could say but that was enough At a bound Ireached the door An Indian was at my horses head loosing the halteras I thought Before he could twist to face me the point of the Ferarawas at his backLuckily he had the wit not to move No kill Uncanoola he mutteredthis without the stirring of a muscle Then as if he were talking tothe horse White squaw she send um word say good byMy point dropped as if another blade had parried the thrustMistress Margery you mean Do you come from herShe send um word say good by he repeatedWhat else did she say I demandedNo say anyting else say good by He turned upon me at that and Isaw why he had kept his face averted He had on the war paint of aCherokee chiefUncanoola good Chelakee now he grinned Help redcoat soldier findCaptain Longknife WahI saw his drift and though I knew his courage well the boldness ofthe thing staggered me He too had penetrated to the inner lines ofthe British encampment at Charlotte and when they had sought an Indiantracker to lift my trail twas he who had volunteered But now myspirits rose With this unexpected ally we might hope to deal forcefullyand yet fairly with my rearguardWhere are your masters now I askedHe spat upon the ground Catawba chief has no master he saidproudly Redcoat palefaces yonder pointing back the way I had comeMake fire boil tea sing song heap smoke pipeWe must take them said IHe nodded Kill um all take scalp WahThe bloodthirstiness of my two allies was appalling But I undertook tocool the Indians ardor explaining that the redcoat soldiers were theLongknifes brothers in a way not to be slain save in honorablebattle I am not sure whether I earned the Catawbas contempt or hispity for my weakness but since he was loyal to the son of his oldbenefactor first and a savage afterward he yielded the pointSo now I made him known to my patriarchal host who all this time hadbeen standing guard at the cabin door with the old Queensarm for aweapon So we three sat on the doorstone and planned it out When thenight was far enough advanced we would stalk the soldiers in theircamp sparing life as we couldWhen all was settled the old man gave us a supper of his humble fareafter which we went into the open again to sit out the hours of waitingThe rain had ceased but the night was cloudy and the darkness a softblack veil to shroud the nearest objects High overhead the autumn windwas sighing in the treetops and now and again a sharper gust wouldbring down a pattering volley of lodged raindrops on the fallen leavesUncanoola sat apart in stoical silence smoking his longstemmed pipeThe old man and I talked in low tones or rather he would tell me of hispast whilst I sat and listened holding the little maid in my armsAfter a time the child fell asleep and I craved permission to put herin the little crib bed in the chimney corner The flickering light ofthe fire fell upon her innocent face when I loosed the clasp of the tinyhands about my neck and laid her down Again the wave of softnesssubmerged me and I bent to leave a kiss upon the sweet unconscious lipsAh my dears you may smile again if you will but at that moment I hada faroff glimpse of the beatitude of fatherhood I was no longer thehard old soldier I have drawn for you I was but a man hungering andthirsting for the love of a wife and trusting clinging little childrenlike this sweet maidI rose turning my back upon the chimney corner and its holdings with asigh For now the time was come for action and I must needs be a man ofblood and iron againLacking the Catawba to guide us I doubt if either the old man or Icould have found my rearguards bivouac near the trail I had left ButUncanoola led us straight through the pitchy darkness and when we werecome upon the three soldiers we found them all asleep around the handfulof campfireTwould have been murder outright to kill them thus and now I think theold patriarch forgot his wrongs and was as merciful as I But not so theCatawba He had armed himself with a stout warclub and before I wasfree to stop him he had knocked two of the three sleepers senseless andwould have battered out their brains but for the old mans interventionAs for the officer I had flung myself upon him in the rush and washaving a pretty handful of him But though he was broad in theshoulders and as agile as a cat he was taken at a sleeping mansdisadvantage and so I presently had the better of himEnough man tis as good as a feast he cried when I had him fastpinioned and thereupon I let him have breath and freedom to sit up Inthe act he had his first good sight of me as I had mine of him TwasTybee and no otherGad my Captain he said feeling his throat If you have a grip likethat for your friends Im damned glad Im not your enemyBut you are I rejoined rather shamefacedly yet thankful to thefingertips that I had not consented to a massacre I am for theCongress and the Commonwealth Lieutenant and you are my prisoner MayI trouble you for the despatches you carryHe looked up at me with a queer grimace on his boyish faceThe devil but youre a cool hand Captain Ireton Whatever you were inthat coil at Appleby youve led the spys long suit this time And Imnot sure whether I like you any the worse for it if so be you must be arebel And with that he gave me the sealed packet and asked what Iwould do with himHis query set me thinking As for the two stunned troopers I meant toturn them over to the old man for safe keeping but I was loath to makeit harder than need be for this goodnatured youngster So I put himupon his honorDo you know what this packet contains I askedHe laughed My Lord did not honor me with his confidence I was tofollow you in to Major Fergusons camp deliver the despatches andvanishGood then you need tell no lies When the Indian has fetched my horseI shall ride to Fergusons camp and you may ride with me I shall askno more than this that you do not fight again till you are exchangedand that you will not tell Major Ferguson whose prisoner you are Do youaccept the termsGad Id be a fool not to But whats in the wind Captain Surely youcan tell me now that I am safely out of the runningYou will know in a day or two and in the meantime ignorance is yourbest safety You can tell Major Ferguson that you were waylaid on theroad by a party of the enemy and that you were paroled and fell in withmeHe looked a little rueful as a good soldier would but was disposed tomake the best of a bad bargainHeres my hand on it he said and a little later we had dragged thetwo troopers to the cabin where the old man became surety for theirsafe keeping and were feeling our way cautiously westward at the heelsof the Catawba who had taken his directions from our patriarchWe pressed forward in silence through the shadowy labyrinth of the woodfor a time but at the crossing of a small runlet where we would stop tolet the horses drink Tybee burst out alaughingTis as good as a play he said Three several times Ive had tochange my mind about you Captain Ireton and Im not cocksure I haveyour measure yet But Ill say this if youve strung my Lordsuccessfully youll be the first to do it and come off alive in theendThe end is not yet my good friend and I may not come off better thanthe others I rejoined And with that we fared on again till we couldsee the campfires of Fergusons little army twinkling between the treetrunksXXXVIIIIN WHICH WE FIND THE GUNMAKERAs you may be sure Major Patrick Ferguson was far too good a soldier toleave his camp unguarded on any side and whilst we were yet a farcannonshot from the glimmering fires a sentrys challenge halted usTo the mans Halt Who goes there I gave the word Friends salvingmy conscience for the needful lie as I mightAdvance friends and give the countersignI confessed my ignorance of the nightword saying that we were aparoled prisoner and a bearer of despatches and asking that we be takento Major Fergusons headquarters There was some little cautiousdemurring on the part of the sentry but finally he passed the word forthe guardcaptain and we were escorted to the tent of the fieldcommanderI marked the encampment as I could in passing through it The littlearmy was threefourths made up of Tory militia and there was drinkingand songsinging and a plentiful lack of discipline around thecampfires of these auxiliaries But a different air was abroad in thecamp of the regulars you would see a soldierly alertness on the part ofthe men and there was no roistering in that quarterMajor Fergusons tent was on a hillock some distance back from thestream and thither we were conducted we I say meaning Tybee andmyself for Uncanoola had disappeared like a whiff of smoke at ourchallenging on the sentry lineLate as it was the major was up and hard at work His tent tabletransformed for the time into a mechanics workbench was littered withgunbarrels and tools and screws and oddshaped pieces of mechanismthedisjointed parts of that breechloading musket of which the ingeniousScotchman was the inventorBeing deep in the creative trance when we came upon him the major gaveus but an absentminded greeting listening with the outward ear onlywhen Tybee reported his mission and his capture and paroleFrom my Lord ye say I hope ye left him well was all the answer theLieutenant got the inventor fitting away at his gunpuzzle the whileTybee made proper rejoinder and stood aside to give me room I drew asealed inclosure from my pocket and laid it on the workbench tableI also have the honor to come from my Lord Cornwallis bringingdespatchesso far I got in my cutanddried speech and then my tongueclave to the roof of my mouth and I could no more finish the sentencethan could a man suddenly nipped in a vise Instead of the carefullydoctored original I had given the major the duplicate despatch takenfrom TybeeAh my dears that was a moment for swift thought and still swifteraction and tis the Ireton genius to be slow and sure and no wise glegat the uptak as a Scot would say Yet for this once my good angelgave me a prompting and the wit to use it In that clocktick ofbenumbing despair when the success of the hazardous venture and muchmore that I wist not of hung suspended by a hair over the abyss offailure I minded me of a boyish trick wherewith I used to fright thetimid blacks in the old days at Appleby Hundred So whilst the major wasreaching for the packetnay when he had it in his handI started backwith a warning cry giving that imitation of the ominous skirrr of arattlesnake which had more than once got me a cuffing from my fatherIn any crisis less tremendous I should have roared alaughing to see thedoughty major and my good friend the lieutenant vie with each other intheir skippings to escape the unseen enemy But it was no laughingmoment for me At a flash my sword was out and I was hacking hither andyon at the imaginary foe In the hurlyburly I contrived to sprawl allacross the workbench table and the packet which would have killed myplotand belike the plotter as wellwas secured and quickly juggledinto hidingDamme see now what youve done youve spilt my breechcharger allabout the place rasped the major when all was over And then Whothe devil are ye anyway and what do ye want wi meI clicked my heels saluted and gave him the express from my Lordtheright one this time He tore off the wrapping swore a hearty soldieroath when he read the fore part of the letter and clapped his legjoyfully like the brave gentleman that he was when he came to thepostscriptumYere a fine fellow Captain yeve brought me good news he saidthen he bade an aide call Captain de Peyster his second in command andin the same breath gave Tybee and me in charge to an ensign for ourbilleting for the nightYou will conceive that I was overjoyed at this seemingly safe and easyplanting of the petard which was to blow my Lord Cornwalliss plans intothe air and in anticipation I saw the tideturning battle and heard thehuzzas of the mountaineer victors But tis a good old saw that cautionsagainst hallooing before you are out of the wood Captain de Peyster wascome and Tybee and I were taking our leave of the major when there wasa sudden commotion among the guards without and a little man in blackhis wig awry and his clothing torn by the rough manhandling of thesentries burst into the tentSeize him seize him he is a rebel spy he shrieked pointing at meAs you would guess all talk paused at this dramatic interruption andall eyes were turned upon me Had the little viper been content to resthis charge upon the simple accusation I know not what might havehappened But when he got his breath he burst out in a tirade of thefoulest abuse cursing me up one side and down the other and ending ina gibbering fit of rage that left him pallid and foaming at thelipsand gave me my cueTis the little madman of Queensborough I said coolly explaining tothe bluff major His mania takes the form of a curious hatred for methough I know not why Two days since he was put in arrest by my Lordsauthority for threatening my life and that of his masters daughterNow it would seem he has broken jail and followed me hitherA lunatic eh He looks it every inch said the major and theblackguard lawyer hearing my counter accusation was doing his best togive it a savor of likelihood by fighting frantically with the twosoldiers who had followed him into the tentOut wi him commanded the major Weve no time to foolish away wi aBedlamite Take him away and peg him out and gi him a dash o water tocool his headPengarvin fought like a fury and his venomous rage defeated all hisattempts to say calmly the words which might have got him a hearing Sohe was haled away spitting and struggling like a trapped wildcat andwhen we were rid of him the major bade us good night againTybee held his peace like a good fellow till we had rolled us in ourblankets before one of the campfires But just as I was dropping asleephe broke out with I would you might tell me what piece of rebelvillainy this is that Ive been a winking accomplice toI laughed Tis a thing to make Major Ferguson rejoice as you saw Andsurely it can be no great villainy to give a man what hes thirstingfor Bide your time Lieutenant and you shall see the outcomeXXXIXTHE THUNDER OF THE CAPTAINS AND THE SHOUTINGThe camp was astir early the next morning and it soon became noisedabout that we were to fall back but only so far as might be needful tofind a strong position From this it was evident that a battle wasimminent though as yet there were no signs of the approach of thepatriotsFrom the camp talk we Tybee and I gleaned some better information ofthe situation A fortnight earlier Major Ferguson had captured two ofthe overmountain men of Clarks party and had sent them to thesettlement on the Watauga with a challenge in due formor rather withthe threat to come and lay the overmountain region waste in default ofan instant return of the pioneers to their allegiance to the kingThis challenge so our scouts told us had been immediately acceptedSevier and Shelby had embodied some two hundred men each from theWatauga and the Holston settlements and Colonel William Campbell thestout old Presbyterian Indian fighter had joined them with as many moreVirginiansCrossing the mountain these three troops had fallen in with otherscattered parties of the border patriots under Benjamin CleavelandMajor Chronicle and Colonel Williams of South Carolina until now asthe scouts reported the challenged outnumbered the challengersLearning this Ferguson who was as prudent as he was brave thought itbest to make his stand at some point nearer the main body of the armyand so the withdrawal from Gilbert Town had fallen into a retreat and apursuitFrom what Captain de Peyster has since told me there would seem to belittle doubt that the major meant to fight when he had manoeuveredhimself into a favorable position this in spite of Lord Cornwallisscommands to the contrary In his despatches he was continually urgingthe need for a bold push in his quarter and asking for Tarleton and asufficient number of the legion to enable him to cope with a mountedenemy But be this as it may the garbled letter I had brought himturned whatever scale there was to turn He had now with him some elevenhundred regulars and Tories the latter decently well drilled he hadevery reason to expect the needed help from Cornwallis and on thenight of my arrival he had word that another Tory force under MajorGibbs would join him in a day or two at farthestFor his battleground Major Ferguson chose the top of a forestcoveredhill the last and lowest elevation in the spur named that day KingsMountainIn some respects the position was all that could be desired There wasroom on the flat hilltop for an orderly disposition of the fightingforce and the slopes in front and rear were steep enough to give anattacking enemy a sharp climb Moreover there was a plentifuloutcropping of stone on the summit scantiest on the broad or outer endof the hill and this was so disposed as to form a natural breastworkfor the defendersBut there were disadvantages also the chief of these being the heavywooding of the slopes to screen the advance of the assaulting party andwhile the major was busy making his dispositions for the fight I was ontenterhooks for fear he would have the trees felled to belt thebreastwork with a clear spaceHe did not do it being restrained as I afterward learned by hisuncertainty as to whether or no the mountain men had cannon Againstartillery posted on the neighboring hillocks the trees were his bestdefense and so he left them standingAs you would suppose my situation was now become most trying and poorTybees was scarcely less so Knowing my name and circumstance andhaving moreover a high regard for my old fieldmarshals genius MajorFerguson was very willing to make use of my experience These askingsfrom one whom I knew for a brave and honorable gentleman let me fallbetween two stools As a patriot spy it was my duty to turn the majorsconfidence as a weapon against him But as an officer and a gentleman Icould by no means descend to such depths of perfidyIn this dilemma I sought to steer a middle course saying that I mustbeg exemption because my long hard ride had reopened my old swordwoundas indeed it had So the major generously let me be thus heapingcoals of fire upon my head and I kept out of his way consorting withTybee who like myself must be an onlooker in the coming frayAs for the lieutenant he was all agog to learn more than I dared tellhim and it irked him most nettlesomely to have a fight in prospect inthe which he was in honor bound not to take a hand Time and again hebegged me to release him from his parole and when I would not he wasfor fighting me a duel with his freedom for a stakeConsider of it Captain Ireton he pleaded For Gods sake putyourself in my place Here am I in the camp of my friends gagged andbound by my word to you whilst your infernal plot whatever it may beworks out to the coup de grce Ye gods it would have been far moremerciful had you run me through in our wrestling match last nightMayhap said I curtly Twas but the choice between two evilsNevertheless in time to come I hope you may conclude that this is thelesser of the twoNo Im damned if I shall he retorted fuming like a disappointedboy and minding me most forcibly of my hotheaded Richard Jennifer Andthen he would repeat I thought you were my friendSo I am as man to man But this matter concerns the welfare of a causeto which I have sworn fealty Take your own words back my lad and putyourself in my place Can I do less than hold you to your pledgeNo I suppose not he would say grumpily Yet tis hard mostdevilish hardTis the fortune of war Another day the shoe may be upon the otherfootThe baggage wagons had been massed across the broad end of the hill toeke out the stone breastwork and the last of these arguing colloquiestook place beneath one of the wagons whither we had crept for shelterfrom the rain which was now pouring again In the midst of our talkMajor Ferguson dived to share our shelter dripping like a waterspanielHa yere carpet soldiers both of ye he snorted and then he beganto swear piteously at the rainTwill be worse for the enemy than for us said Tybee We can atleast keep our powder dryDamn the enemy quoth the major cheerfully So the weather does notput the creeks up and hold Tarleton and Major Gibbs back from us tis asmall matter whether the rebels powder be dry or soakedYou have made all your dispositions Major Tybee askedThe major nodded All in applepie order no thanks to either of yeTis a strong position this eh Captain Ireton Im thinking not allthe rebel banditti out of hell will drive us from itTis good enough I agreed and here the talk was broken off by themajors diving out to berate some of his Tory militiamen who werepreparing to make a night of it with a jug of their vile country liquorThe rain continued all that Friday night and well on into the forenoonof the Saturday During this interval we waited with scouts out for theupcoming of the mountain men At noon Major Ferguson sent a finalexpress to Lord Cornwallis urging the hurrying on of thereinforcements not knowing that his former despatch had beenintercepted nor that Tarleton had not as yet started to the rescue Alittle later the scouts began to come in one by one with news of theapproaching riflemenThere was but a small body of them not above a thousand men in all sothe spies said and my heart misgave me They were without cannon andthey lacked bayonets and moreover when all was said they were butmilitia all untried save in border warfare with the Indians Could theysuccessfully assault the fortified camp whose defendersthanks to themajors ingenuityhad fitted butcherknives to the muzzles of theirguns in lieu of bayonets Nay rather would they have the courage totryTwas late in the afternoon before these questions were answered Therain had ceased and the chill October sunlight filtered aslant throughthe trees With the clearing skies a cold wind had sprung up and on thehilltop the men cowered behind the rock breastwork and waited instrained silence At the last moment Major Ferguson sent Captain dePeyster to me with the request that I take command of the Tory force setapart to defend the wagon barricadethis if my weariness would permitI went with the captain to make my excuses in personSay no more Captain said this generous soldier when I began somelame plea for further exemption I had forgot your swordcut Takeshelter for yourself and look on whilst we skin this riffraff aliveAnd so he let me off a favor which will make me think kindly of PatrickFerguson so long as I shall live For now my work was done and had heinsisted I should have told him flatly who and what I wasand paid thepenaltyI had scarce rejoined Tybee at the wagons when the long roll of thedrums broke the silence of the hilltop and a volley fire of musketryfrom the rock breastwork on the right told us the battle was on Tybeegave me one last reproachful look and stood out to see what could beseen and I stood with himYour friends are running he said when there was no reply to theopening volley and truly I feared he was right At the bottom of theslope scattering groups of the riflemen could be seen hastening toright and left But I would not admit the charge to TybeeI think not I objected denying the apparent fact They have cometoo far and too fast to turn back now for a single overshot volleyBut theyll never face the fire up the hill with the bayonet to cap itat the top he insistedThat remains to be seen we shall know presently Ah I thought sohere they comeAt the word the forestcovered steep at our end of the hill sprang alivewith dunclad figures darting upward from tree to tree Volley aftervolley thundered down upon them as they climbed but not once did thedodging charge up the slope pause or falter Unlike all other irregularsI had ever seen whose idea of a battle is to let off the piece and runthese mountain men held their fire like veterans closing in upon thehilltop steadily and in a grim silence broken only by the shoutingencouragements of the leadersthis until their circling line wascompletedThen suddenly from all sides of the beleaguered camp arose a yell toshake the stoutest courage and with that the woodcovered slopes beganto spit fire not in volleys but here and there in irregular snappingsand cracklings as the sureshot riflemen saw a mark to pull trigger onThe effect of this finebead target practicefor it was naughtelsewas most terrific All along the breastwork front and rearcrouching men sprang up at the rifle crackings to fling their arms allabroad and to fall writhing and wrestling in the death throe At our endof the hill where the rock barrier was thinnest the slaughter wasappalling and above the din of the firearms we could hear the bellowedcommands of the sturdy old Indian fighter Benjamin Cleaveland urginghis men up to still closer quarters A little nearer my brave boys alittle nearer and we have them Press on up to the rocks Theyll be asgood a breastwork from our side as from theirsYou will read in the histories that the Tory helpers of Ferguson foughtas men with halters round their necks and so indeed amany of themdid But though they were most pitiless enemies of ours I bear themwitness that they did fight well and bravely and not as men who fightfor fears sakeAnd they were most bravely officered Major Ferguson boldly conspicuousin a white linen huntingshirt drawn on over his uniform was here andthere and everywhere and always in the place where the bullets flewthickest His left hand had been hurt at the first patriot gun fire butit still held the silver whistle to his lips and the shrill skirling ofthe little pipe was the loyalist rallying signal Captain de Peystertoo did ample justice to the uniform he wore and when CampbellsVirginians gained the summit at the far end of the hilltop twas dePeyster who led the bayonet charge that forced the patriot riflemensome little way down the slopeBut these are digressions No man sees more of a battle than that littlecircle of which he is the center and the fighting was hot enough at thewagon barricade to keep both Tybee and me from knowing at the time whatwas going on beyond our narrow range of sight or hearing You mustpicture therefore for yourselves a very devils pandemonium let looseupon the little hilltop so soon as the mountain men gained their vantageground at the fronting of the rock breastwork cries frantic shouts ofGod save the king yells fierce and wordless men in red and men inhomespun rushing madly hither and yon in a vain attempt to repel a frontand rear attack at the same instant Twas a hell set free with noquarter asked or given and where we stood the Tory defenders of thewagon barrier were presently dropping around us in heaps and windrows ofdead and dying like men suddenly plaguesmittenIn such a time of asking you must not think we stood aloof and looked oncoldly At the first fire Tybee stripped off his coat and fell to workwith the wounded and I quickly followed his lead praying that now mywork was done some one of the flying missiles would find its mark in meand let me die a soldiers deathSo it was that I saw little more of the battle detail and of thatfierce frenzytime I have memory pictures only of the dead and dyingof the torn and wounded and bleeding men with whom we wrought strivingas we might to stanch the ebbing lifetide or to ease the dying gentlydown into the valley of shadowsAnd as for my prayer it went all unanswered Once when I had a dyingTorys head pillowed on my knee I saw a rifleman thrust his weaponbetween the wheelspokes of the outer wagon and draw a bead on me Iheard the crack of the Deckard the zip of the bullet singing at myear and the mans angry oath at his missing of me Once again arifleball passed through my hair at the braiding of the queue and Ifelt the hot touch of it on my scalp like a breath of flame Anothertime a mountaineer leaped the rock barrier to beat me down with the buttof his rifleand in the very act Tybee rose up and throttled him I sawthe grapple sprang to my feet and whipped out my swordStop I commanded you have broken your parole LieutenantThe freed borderer glared from one to the other of us Loonies heyelled Ill slaughter the both of ye And so he would have done Imake no doubt had we not laid hold of him together and heaved him backover the breastworkThese are but incidents points of contact where the fray touched us twoat the wagon barricade I pass them by with the mention as I havepassed by the sterner horrors of that furious killingtime These lastare too large for my poor pen As we could gather in the din andtumult the mountain men rushed again and again to the attack and asoften the brave major or De Peyster led the bayonet charges thatpushed them back Yet in the end the unerring bullet outpressed thebayonet there came a time when flesh and blood could no longer endurethe deathdealing crossfire from front and rearI saw the end was near when the major ordered the final charge andCaptain de Peyster formed his line and led it forward at a doublequickThe mountaineers held more than half the hilltop now and this forlornhope was to try to drive them down the farther slopes On it went and Icould see the men pitch and tumble out of the line until atbayonetreach of the riflemen there were less than a dozen afoot and fitto make the pushDe Peyster fought his way back to the wagons gasping and bloody Someof the Tories crowding around us raised a white flag The major sorelywounded now and all but disabled swore a great oath and rode roughshodinto the ruck of cowering militiamen to pull down the flag Again thewhite token of surrender was raised and again the major rode in to beatit down with his sword At this Captain de Peyster put in his wordTis no use Major there is no more fight left in us Five minutesmore of this and well be shot down to a manFergusons reply was a raging oath broad enough to cover all the enemyand his own beaten remnant as well and then before a hand could belifted to stay him he had wheeled his horse and was galloping straightfor the patriot line at the farther extremity of the hilltopWhat he meant to do will never be known till that great day when allsecrets shall be revealed For that furious oath was this bravegentlemans last word to us or to any A dozen bounds it may be thegood charger carried him then the storm of riflebullets beat him fromthe saddle And so died one of the gallantest officers that ever did anunworthy kings work on the field of battleI would I might forget the terrible scene which followed this killing ofthe British commander Twas little to our credit but I may not pass itover in silence De Peyster quickly sent a man to the front with a whiteflag and the answer was a murderous volley which killed the flagbearerand many others Again the flag was raised on a riflebarrel and oncemore the answer was a storm of the leaden death poured into thepanicstricken crowd huddled like sheep at the wagonsGod said de Peyster and with that he began to beat his men into linewith the flat of his sword in a frenzy of desperation being minded ashe afterward told me to give them the poor chance to die afighting[Illustration]I saw not what followed upon this last despairing effort for now Tybeewas down and I was kneeling beside him to search for the wound But whenI looked again the crackling crashes of the riflefiring had ceasedA stout grayheaded man whom I afterward knew as Isaac Shelbysfather was riding up from the patriot line to receive Captain dePeysters sword and the battle was endedXLVAE VICTISIf my hand were not sure enough to draw you some speaking picture ofthis our epochmarking battle of Kings Mountain it falters still moreon coming to the task of setting forth the tragic horrors of thedreadful afternight Wherefore I pray you will hold me excused mydears if I hasten over the events tripping upon the heels of thevictory touching upon them only as they touch upon my taleBut as for the stagesetting of the afterscene you may hold in yourminds eye the stony hilltop strewn with the dead and dying the huddleof cowed prisoners at the wagon barricade the mountaineers mad withthe victors frenzy swarming to surround us Twas a clipping fromChaos and Night gone bloodcrazed till Sevier and Isaac Shelby broughtsomewhat of order out of it and then came the reckoningOf the seven hundredodd prisoners the greater number were Tories manyof them redhanded from scenes of rapine in which their present captorshad suffered the loss of all that men hold dear So you will not wonderthat there were knives and rifles shaken aloft and fierce and vengefulcounsels in which it was proposed to put the captives one and all to thecord and treeBut now again Sevier and Shelby seconded by the fiery PresbyterianWilliam Campbell flung themselves into the breach pleading for delayand a fair trial for such as were blood guilty And so the dismal nightmade chill and comfortless by the cold wind and most doleful by thegroans and cries of the wounded wore away and the dawn of the Sundayfound us lying as we were in the bloody shambles of the hilltopWith the earliest morning light the burial parties were at work andsince the stony battleground would not lend itself for the trenchingthe graves were dug in the vales below Captain de Peyster begged hardfor leave to bury the brave Ferguson on the spot where he fell buttwas impossible and now I am told the stout old Scotsman lies sideby side with our Major Will Chronicle of Mecklenburg who fell justbefore the ending of the battleThe dead buried and the wounded cared for in some rough and readyfashion preparations were made in all haste for a speedy withdrawalfrom the neighborhood of the battlefield Rumor had it that Tarletonwith his invincible legion was within a few hours march and themountain men sodden weary with the toils of the flying advance and thehardfought conflict were in no fettle to cope with a fresh foeAs yet I had not made myself known to the patriot commanders having myhands and heart full with the care of poor Tybee who was grievouslyhurt and being in a measure indifferent to what should befall meBut now as we were about to march I was dragged before the committee ofcolonels and put to the questionYour uniform is a strange one to us sir said Isaac Shelby lookingme up and down with that heavylidded right eye of his Explain yourrank and standing if you pleaseI told my story simply and as I thought effectively and had onlyblack looks for my painsTis a strange tale surely sirtoo strange to be believable quothShelby You are a traitor Captain Iretonof the kind we need notcumber ourselves with on a marchWho says that word of me I demanded caring not much for that towhich his threat pointed but something for my good nameShelby turned and beckoned to a man in the group behind him Stand outJohn Whittlesey he directed and I found myself face to face with thatrifleman of Colonel Davies party who had been so fierce to hang me atthe fording of the CatawbaThis man gave his testimony briefly telling but the bare truth A weekearlier I had passed in Davies camp for a trueblue patriot thisthough I was wearing a ragged British uniform at the moment As for thewitness himself he had misdoubted me all along but the colonel hadtrusted me and had sent me on some secret mission the inwardness ofwhich he John Whittlesey had been unable to come at though heconfessed that he had tried to worm it out of me before parting companywith me on the road to CharlotteI looked from one to another of my judgesIf this be all gentlemen the man does but confirm my story I saidIt is not all said Shelby Mr Pengarvin stand forthThere was another stir in the backgrounding group and the pettifoggeredged his way into the circle keeping well out of handreach of me Howhe had made shift to escape from Fergusons men to change sides and toturn up thus serenely in the ranks of the overmountain men I know notto this day nor ever shall knowTell these gentlemen what you have told me said Shelby briefly andthe factor cool and collected now rehearsed the undeniable facts howin Charlotte I had figured as a member of Lord Cornwalliss militaryfamily how I had carried my malignancy to the patriot cause to thelength of throwing a stanch friend to the commonwealth to wit one OwenPengarvin into the common jail how as Lord Cornwalliss trustedaidedecamp I had been sent with an express to Major Ferguson Alsohe suggested that if I should be searched some proof of my duplicitymight be found upon meAt this William Campbell nodded to two of his Virginians and I wassearched forthwith and that none too gently In the breast pocket of myhussar jacket they found that accursed duplicate despatch the one I hadtaken from Tybee and which had so nearly proved my undoing in theinterview with Major FergusonIsaac Shelby opened and read the accusing letter and passed it aroundamong his colleaguesI shall not ask you why this was undelivered sir he said to mesternly Tis enough that it was found upon your person and itsufficiently proves the truth of this gentlemans accusation Have youaught further to say Captain Iretonaught that may excuse us for notleaving you behind us in a halterDo you wonder my dears that I lost my head when I saw how completelythe toils of this little blackclothed fiend had closed around meTwice nay thrice I tried to speak calmly as the crisis demanded Thenmad rage ran away with me and I burst out in yelling curses so hot theywould surely dry the ink in the pen were I to seek to set them downhereTwas a silly thing to do you will say and much beneath the dignity ofa grown man who cared not a bodle for his life and not greatly for themanner of its losing I grant you this and yet it was that samebullbellow of soldier profanity that saved my life Whilst I was in thestorm of it cursing the lawyer by every shouted epithet I could laytongue to a miracle was wrought and Richard Jennifer and EphraimYeates pushed their way through the everthickening ring of onlookersthe latter to range himself beside me with his brownbarreled rifle inthe hollow of his arm and my dear lad to fling himself upon me in abears hug of joyous recognition and greetingScore one for me Jack he cried We were fair at tother end of themountain and twas I told Eph there was only one man in the twoCarolinas who could swear the match of that Then he whirled upon myjudges What is this gentlemena court martial Captain Ireton is myfriend and as true a patriot as ever drew breath What is your chargeColonel Sevier in whose command Richard and the old borderer had foughtin the hilltop battle undertook to explain I stood selfconfessed asthe bearer of despatches from Lord Cornwallis to Major Ferguson hesaid and I had claimed that the orders had been so altered as to delaythe majors retreat and so to bring on the battle But they had justfound Lord Cornwalliss letter in my pocket still sealed andundelivered And the tenor of it was precisely opposite to that of anorder calculated to delay the majors march as Mr Jennifer could seeif he would read itWhile Sevier was talking the old borderer was fumbling in the breast ofhis huntingshirt and now he produced a packet of papers tied aboutwith red tapePears to me like you Injunkillers from tother side o the mountingis in a mighty hot sweat to hang somebody he said as coolly as if hewere addressing a mob of underlings Heres a mess o billydoos withLord Cornwalliss name to em that I found mongst Major Fergusonsleavings If youll look em over maybe youll find out immejitly ifnot sooner that Capn John here is telling ye the plumb truthThe papers were examined hastily and presently John Sevier lighted uponthe despatch I had carried and delivered Thereat the colonels put theirheads together and then my case was reopened with Sevier asspokesmanWe have a letter here which appears to be the original order toFerguson Captain Ireton Can you repeat from memory the postscriptumwhich you say was added to itI gave the gist of my old patriarchs addendum as well as I could andthereupon suspicion fled away and my late judges would vie with oneanother in hearty frontier handgrasps and apologies whilst the throngthat ringed us in forgot caution and weariness and gave me a cheer towake the echoesTwas while this burst of gratulation was abuzz that Ephraim Yeatesraised a cry of his ownStop that there blacklegged imp o the law he shouted pushing hisway out of the circle Hes the one that ought to hangThere was a rush for the wagon barricade a clatter of horsehoofs onthe hillside below and Yeatess rifle went to his face But the bulletflew wide and the blackgarbed figure clinging to the horses mane wassoon out of sight among the treesEz I allow yed better look out for that yallerskinned littlevarmint Capn John quoth the old man carefully wiping his riflepreparatory to reloading it Hes rank pizen he is and yell have tobreak his neck sooner r later I lowed to save ye the trouble but oldBess got mighty foul yestiddy with all the shootings and goings on andI haint got no leadbrush to clean her outNow that I was fully exonerated I was free to go and come as I chosenay more I was urged to cast in my lot with the overmountainpartizans As to this I took counsel with Richard Jennifer whilst thecolonels were setting their commands in order for the march and loadingthe prisoners with the captured guns and ammunitionWhat is to the fore Dick I asked more fightingThe lad shook his head Never another blow I fear Jack These fellowscrossed the mountain to whip Ferguson Having done it they will gohomeI could not forego a hearty curse upon this worst of all militiaweaknesses the disposition to disperse as soon as ever a battle wasfoughtTis nigh on to a crime said I This victory smartly followed upmight well be the turning of the tide for usBut the lad would not admit the qualifying condition Twill be no lessas it is he declared Mark you Jack twill put new life into thecause and nerve every man of ours afresh And as for the redcoats if myLord Cornwallis gets the news of it in a lump as he should Gates willhave plenty of time to set himself in motion slow as he isTwas then I had an inspiration and I thought upon it for a momentWhat are your plans RichardHe shook his head I have none worth the nameThen you are not committed to Colonel Sevier for a term of serviceNo nor to Cleaveland nor McDowell nor any We heard there was to befighting hereawayEphraim Yeates and Iand we came as volunteersGood then I have a thought which may stand for what it is worth Tomake the most of this victory over Major Ferguson Gates should beapprised at once and by a sure tongue and his Lordship should have thenews quickly too and in a lump as you say Let us take horse and ridepost we two you to Gates at Hillsborough and I to CharlotteI had thought of my part of that he said in a muse Then he camealive to the risk I should run But you cant well go back toCornwallis now Jack tis playing with death There will be othernewscarriersthere are sure to be and a single breath to whisper whatyou have done will hang you higher than HamanI shrugged at this Tis but a war hazardHe looked at me curiously I saw a shrewd question in his eyes and setinstant action as a barrier in the way of its askingLet us find Colonel Sevier and beg us the loan of a pair of horsessaid I and so we were kept from coming upon the dangerous ground ofpointed questions and evasive answersSomewhat to my surprise both Sevier and Shelby fell in at once with ourproject commending it heartily and I learned from the lips of thatcourtliest of frontiersmen Nolichucky Jack the real reason for theproposed hurried return of the overmountain men The Cherokees neverto be trusted had as it seemed procured war supplies from the Britishposts to the southward and were even now on the verge of an uprisingBy forced marches these hardy borderers hoped to reach their homes intime to defend them Otherwise as both commanders assured us theywould take the field with GatesWe have done what we could Captain Ireton and not altogether what wewould said Sevier in the summingup It remains now for General Gatesto drive home the wedge we have entered Then he looked me full in theeyes and asked if I thought Horatio Gates would be the man to beetlethat wedge well into the logI made haste to say that I knew little of the general that I was but aprejudiced witness at best since my father had known and misliked theman in Braddocks illfated campaign against the French in 55 ButRichard spoke his mind more freelyTis not in the man at this pass Colonel Sevier he would say notafter Camden I know our Carolinians as well as any and they will neverstand a second time under a defeated leader If General Washington wouldsend us some one else or best of all if he would but come himselfGeorge Washington ah there is a man indeed said Sevier hisdarkblue eyes lighting up Whilst he lives there is always a goodhope But we must be doing gentlemen and so must you God speed youboth Our compliments to General Gates Mr Jennifer and you may tellhim what I have told youthat but for our redskin threateners we shouldright gladly join him As for Lord Cornwallis you Captain Ireton willknow best what to say to him I pray God you may say it and come offalive to tell us how he took itWe made our acknowledgments and when I had bespoken good care forTybee we took leave of these stout fighters and of old Ephraim aswell since the borderer was to serve as a guide for the overmountainmen at least till they were come upon familiar ground to the westwardTwas now hard upon ten of the clock in the forenoon and we had ourlast sight of the brave little army whilst it was wending its way slowlydown the slopes of Kings Mountain Of what became of it how its wearymarch dragged on from day to day how it was hampered by the train ofcaptives halted by rainswollen torrents and was wellnigh starvedwithal of all these things you may read elsewhere But now you mustride with Richard Jennifer and me and our way lay to the eastwardAll that Sunday we pressed forward hasting as we could through thestark columned aisles of the autumnstripped forest and looking hourlyto come upon Tarletons legion marching out to Fergusons reliefSince Richard Jennifer had ridden to the hounds in all this middleground from boyhood we were able to take my blind wanderings in reverseas the arrow flies and by nightfall we were well down upon the maintraveled road leading to Beatties fording of the CatawbaAs your map will show you this was taking me somewhat out of my way tothe northward but it was Richards most direct route to Salisbury andbeyond and by veering thus we made the surer of missing ColonelTarleton who as we thought would likely cross the river at the lowerfordOnce in the high road we pushed on briskly for the river nor did wedraw rein until the sweating beasts were picking their way in thedarkness down the last of the hills which sentinel the Catawba to thewestwardAt the foot of this hill a byroad led to Macgowans ford some six milesfarther down the river and here as I supposed our ways would lieapart But when we came to the forking of the road Richard pulled hismount into the bypath clapping the spurs to the tired horse so thatwe were a good mile beyond the forking before I could overtake himHow now lad said I when I had run him down Would you take afighting hazard when you need not There is sure to be a British patrolat the lower fordHe jerked his beast down to a walk and we rode in silence side by sidefor a full minute before he said gruffly Youd never find the wayaloneI laughed Barring myself you are the clumsiest of evaders Dick I amon my own ground here and that you know as well as IDamn you he gritted between his teeth When we are coming nearAppleby Hundred you are fierce enough to be rid of meI saw his drift at that how he would take all the chance of capture anda spys rope for the sake of passing within a mile of Mistress Margeryor of the house he thought she was inGo back Dick whilst you may said I She is not at ApplebyHundredHe turned upon me like a lion at bayWhat have you done with herPeace you foolish boy I am not her keeper Her father took her toCharlotte on the very day you saw her safe at homeHe reined up short in the narrow way So he said most bitingly Andthat is why you take the embassy to Lord Cornwallis and fub me off withthe one to Gates By heaven Captain Ireton we shall change rles hereand nowAh my dears the lovemadness is a curious thing Here was a man whohad saved my life so many times I had lost the count of them feelingfor my throat in the murk of that October night as my bitterest foemanmightAnd surely it was the lovedemon in me that made me say You think I amstanding in your way Richard Jennifer Well so I am for whilst I liveyou may not have her Why dont you draw and cut me downTwas then Satan marked my dear lad for his very ownOn guard he cried draw and defend yourself and with that thegreat claymore leaped from its sheath to flash in the starlightWhat with his reining back for space to whirl the steel I had the timeto parry the descending blow But at the balancing instant thebrotherhating devil had the upper hand whispering me that here was thedeath I coveted that Margery might have her lover if so she wouldwith her husbands blood upon his headSo I sat motionless while the broadsword cut its circle in air and camedown and then I knew no more till I came to with a bees hive buzzingin my ears to find myself lying in the dank grass at the path side Myhead was on Richards knee and he was dabbling it with water in hissoaked kerchiefXLIHOW I PLAYED THE HOST AT MY OWN FIRESIDEYou may be sure that by now the anger gale had blown itself out thatthe madness had passed for both of us and when I stirred Richard brokeout in a tremulous babblement of thanksgiving for that he had not slainme outrightI was mad Jack as mad as any Bedlamite he would say The devilwhispered me that you would fight that you wanted but a decent excuseto thrust me out of the way And when I saw you would not stir twastoo late to do aught but turn the flat of the blade Oh God help meIll never let a second thought of that little Tory pratapace send meto hell againNay said I no such rash promises I pray you Richard We are buttwo poor fools with the love of a woman set fair between us But youneed not fight me for it The love is yoursnot mineDont say that Jack Im selfish enough to wish it were true as it isnot I know whereof I speakNo I denied struggling to my feet it has been yours from thefirst Dick I am but a sorry interloperFor a moment he was all solicitude to know if my head would let mestand but when I showed him I was no more than clumsily dizzy from theeffects of the blow he went onI say I know and I do Jack She has refused me againI groaned in spirit I knew it must have come to that Yet I would askwhen and whereTwas on our last days riding he went on after we had had yournote saying you would undertake a mission for Colonel DavieI took two steps and groped for the horses bridle reinDid she tell you why she must refuse youHe helped me find the rein for my hand and the stirrup for my footThere was no why but the oneshe does not love meBut I say she does Dick and I too know whereof I speakHe flung me into the saddle as a strong man might toss a boy and Iunderstood how that saying of mine had gone into his bloodThen there must be some barrier that I know not of he said Whereuponhe put hand to head as one who tries to remember Stay did you not saythere was a barrier Jackwhen we were wrestling with death in theIndian fires Or did I dream itYou did not dream it But you were telling me what she saidOh yes twas little enough She cut me off at the first word as ifmy speaking were a mortal sin And when I would have tried again shegave me a look to make me wince and broke out crying as if her heartwould burstI steadied myself as I could by the saddle horn and waited till he wasup and we were moving on Then I would say Truly there is a barrierRichard if I promise you that I am going to Charlotte to remove it oncefor all will you trust me and go about your affair with General GatesTrust you Jack Who am I that I should do aught else When I am cooland sane Im none so cursed selfish I could even give her over to youwith a free hand could I but hear her say she loves you as I would haveher love me But when I am mad Ah God only knows the black bloodthere is in the heart at such timesWe rode on together in silence after that and were come to the bank ofthe river before we spoke again But here Dick went back to my warningsaying whilst we let the horses drink Tis patrolled on the otherbank you sayIt was when I passed it a few days agoneThen I will turn back and cross at Beatties Twill make you a riskyou need not taketo have me with youBut I thought now that the upper ford might be guarded as well and ifthere must be a cutting of a road through the enemys outpost line forDick two could do it better than one So I saidNo we are here now and if need be I can lend you the weight of asecond blade to see you safe throughAnd you with your head humming like a basket of bees as I make nodoubt it willI laughed I should be but a sorry soldier and a sorrier friend if Ishould let a lovetap with the flat of a blade make me fail you at thepinchHe reached across the little gap that parted us and grasped my handBy God he swore most feelingly you are as true as the steel youcarry Jack IretonNay said I in honest shame I do confess I was thinking less of myfriend than of the importance of the errand he rides onBut if there should be a fight you will spoil your chance of comingpeaceably to Charlotte and my Lords headquartersIf I am recognizedyes But the night is dark and a brush with theoutpost need not betray meAt this he consented grudgingly and we pushed on to the crossing Nowsince this fording place of Master Macgowans has marched into ourhistory you will like to know what the historians do not tell younamely how it was but a makeshift wading place armpit deep over amuddy bottom from the western bank to the bar above an island inmidstream and deflecting thence through rocky shallows to a point onthe eastern bank some distance below the island Twas here that LordCornwallis got entangled some months laterbut I must not anticipateWe made the crossing of the main current in safety and were asplash inthe rocky shallows beyond the island when we sighted the campfires ofthe outpost To ride straight upon the patrol was to invite disasterand though Jennifer was for a charging dash a hurlyburly with thesteel and so on to freedom beyond he listened when I pointed out thatour beasts were too nearly outworn to charge and that the noise we mustmake would rouse the camp and draw the fire of every piece in it longbefore we could reach the bank and come to blade workWhat for it then he asked impatiently My courage is freezingwhilst we waitThere is nothing for it but to hold straight on across I saidThat we can not twill be over the horses ears The beasts will drownthemselves and us as wellHow we should have argued it out I do not know for just then Jennifershorse scenting the troop mounts on the farther shore cocked tail andears let out a squealing neigh and fell to curveting and plunging in aracket that might have stood for the splashings of an advancing armyIn a twinkling the outpost camp was astir and a bellowing hail came tous across the water Having no answer the troopers began to let offtheir pieces haphazard in the darkness and with the singing zip ofthe first musket ball Richard went battlemad as he always did in theface of dangerAt them he thundered clapping spurs to his jaded beast and whippingout the great claymore and so we charged the forlornest hope that everfell upon an enemyHow we came ashore alive through the gunfire is one of those mysteriesto which every battle adds its quota but the poor beasts we rode werenot so lucky Jennifers horse went down while we were yet some yardsfrom the bank and mine fell a moment later To face a score of waitingenemies afoot was too much for even Richards rash courage so when wewere free of the struggling horses we promptly dove for shelter underthe upstream bankHere the darkness stood our friend and when the redcoat troopers camedown to the rivers edge with torches to see what had become of us wetook advantage of the noise they made and stole away upstream till ashelving beach gave us leave to climb to the valley level aboveRichard shook himself like a watersoaked spaniel and laughed grimlyWell here we are safe across horseless and well belike to freeze todeath he commented What nextI made him a bow You are on my demesne of Appleby Hundred CaptainJennifer and it shall go hard with us if we can not find a fire to warma guest and a horse to mount him withal Let us go to the manor houseand see what we can discoverHe entered at once into the spirit of the jest and together we trudgedthe scant mile through the stubblefields to my old rooftree As youwould guess we looked to find the manor house turned into an outpostheadquarters but now we were desperate enough to face anythingHowbeit not to rush blindly into the jaws of a trap we first routedout the old black majordomo at the negro quarters and when we learnedfrom him that the great house was quite deserted we took possession andhad the black make us a rousing fire in the kitchenarch Nay morewhen we had steamed ourselves a little dry we had old Anthony stew andgrill for us and fetch us a bottle of that madeira of my fatherslaying inA toast cried Richard when the bottle came springing to his feetwith the glass held high To the dear lady of Appleby Hundred and mayshe forgather with the man she loves best be it you or I or anotherJack IretonWe drank it standing and after would sit before the fire havering liketwo lovesick schoolboys over the charms of that dear lady to whom oneof us was less than naught and to whom the other could be but naughtwhilst that first one livedYou will smile my dears that we should come to this when but a shorthour before one of us had been bent upon slaying the other for MistressMargerys sake But the human heart is manysided notably that heartthe soldier carries And though I looked not to live beyond the settingof another sun I was glad to my fingertips to have this lastlovingcup with my dear lad I thought it would nerve me bravely forwhat must comeand so it did though not as I prefiguredWe were still sitting thus before the kitchenarch when the dawn beganto dim the firelight and the work of the new day confronted us Pinneddown old Anthony confessed that some two or three horses of the ApplebyHundred stables had escaped the hands of the foragers of both sides andtwo of these he fetched for us Of the twain one chanced to beBlackstar the good beast which had carried me from New Berne in thespring and so I had my own horse betwixt my knees when I set Dick amile on the road to Salisbury and bade him farewellHis last word to me was one of generous cautionRemember Jack haste haste post haste is your watchword Therewill be other couriers in from the battlefield at Kings Mountain andyou must hang and fire your newspetard and vanish before they come tobetray youTrust me said I evasively and so we parted he to gallop eastwardand I to charge down peaceably upon that British outpost we had setabuzz in the small hours of the nightXLIIIN WHICH MY LORD HAS HIS MARCHING ORDERSThough I had passed out of the British lines less than a week before indecent good odor save for Colonel Tarletons ill word I met withnothing like the welcome at the outpost camp that a kings courier had aright to expectThe captain in command was not the one who had passed me out He was asurly brute of the Yorkshire breed and when he had heard that I was anexpress rider from Major Ferguson he was pleased to demand my papersTo this I must needs make answer that I carried no written despatchesthat my news was for the commanderinchiefs private ear This I toldmy Yorkshire pig demanding to be sent under guard if he chose to theheadquarters in CharlotteBut Captain Nobbut would hear to no such reasonable proposal On thecontrary he would hold me in arrest till he could report me and haveinstructions from his colonelKnowing what a stake it was I rode for you may imagine how this day indurance ate into me like a canker With ordinary diligence the trooperwho carried the news of me should have gone to Charlotte by way ofQueensborough and returned by noon But being of the same surly breedwith his captain twas full three of the clock before he came amblingback with an order to set me forthwith upon the road to headquartersOnce free of the camp of detention you may be sure I put Blackstar tohis best paces but hasten as I would it was coming on to evening when Ipassed the inner safety line and galloped down the high street of thetownAs luck would have it the first familiar face I saw was that of CharlesStedman the commissarygeneral On my inquiry he directed me straightMy Lord is at supper at Mr Stairs Have you news CaptainI drew breath of relief Happily the loss of the day had not made me thebearer of stale tidings So I made answer with proper reticence sayingthat I had news but it was for Lord Cornwalliss ear first of all Nonethe less if the commissarygeneral were pleased to come with meHe took the hint at once and he it was who procured me instantadmittance to the house and who took on himself the responsibility ofbreaking in upon the party in the supperroomI shall not soon forget the scene that fronted us when we came into myLords presence The supper was in some sort a gala feast held in honorof my Lords accession to his earldom The table lighted by greatsilver candelabra which I recognized as Ireton heirlooms was wellfilled around by the members of the commanderinchiefs militaryfamily with the earl at the head and Mistress Margery bedight asbefitted a lady of the quality behind the teaurn at the footAt our incoming all eyes were turned upon us but it required my Lordssharp question to make me leave off dwelling upon my sweet ladysradiant beautyHow now Captain Ireton Do you bring us news from the majorI broke the fascinating eyehold and turned slowly to face my fateI do my LordWell what of him You left him hastening to rejoin with his newloyalist levies I hopeI drew my sword reversed it and laid it upon the tableMay all the enemies of the Commonwealth be even as he is my Lord Isaid quietlyNow truly I had hanged my petard well and twas plain the shock of ithad gone far to shatter the wall of confidence our enemies had buildedon the field of Camden and elsewhere Had a handgrenade with the fusealight been dropped upon the table the consternation could scarce havebeen greater To a man the tableful was up and thronging round me butabove all the hubbub I heard a little cry of misery from the tablefootwhere my lady satHow is this sirexplain yourself thundered my Lord forgettingfor once his mild suavityTis but a brief tale and I will make it as crisp as may be in thetelling I replied I came upon the major some miles this side of thecrossing of the Broad He was marching to rejoin you in accordance withhis orders But when he had your Lordships command to stand and fighthe obeyedMy commandbut I gave him no such orderNay truly you did notneither in the original nor in the duplicatemy Lord But when we had waylaid Lieutenant Tybee and quenched theduplicate and had so amended the original as to make it fit ourpurpose the brave major thanked you for what you had not done and madehis stand to await the upcoming of the overmountain menFor a moment I thought they would hew me limb from limb but my Lordquelled the fierce outburst with a wordPut up your swords gentlemen We shall know how to deal with thistraitor he said And then to me Go on sir if you please there hasbeen a battle as I take itThere has indeed The mountain men came up with us in the afternoon ofthe Saturday In an hour onethird of the majors force was dead ordying the major himself was slain and every living man left on thefield was a prisonerAgain a dozen swords hissed from their scabbards and again I heard thelittle cry of misery from the tablefoot I bowed my head lookingmomently to pay the penalty but once more my Lord put the swordsasideLet us have a clean breast of it this time Captain Ireton he saidYou know well what you have earned and nothing you can say will makeit better or worse for you Was this your purpose in making yoursubmission to meIt wasAnd you have been a rebel from the firstI met the cold anger in the womanish eyes as a condemned man mightI have my Lordsince the day nine years agone when I learned thatyour kings minions had hanged my father in the RegulationThen it was a farrago of lies you told me about your adventures in thewestern mountainsNot wholly It was your Lordships good pleasure to send succors ofpowder and lead to your allies the western savages I and three othersfollowed Captain Falconnet and his Indians and I have the honor toreport that we overtook and exploded them with their own powder cargoAnd Captain Sir Francis Falconnet with themI do so hope and trust my LordHe turned short on his heel and for a moment a silence as of death fellupon the room Then he took the Ferara from the table and sought tobreak it over his knee but the good blade like the cause it stood forbent like a withe and would not snapPut this spy in irons and clear the room he ordered sharply Andthis is how the little drama ended with the supper guests crowding tothe door with my Lord pacing back and forth at the tablehead with twosergeants bearing me away to await where and how I knew not the wordwhich should efface meXLIIIIN WHICH I DRINK A DISH OF TEABeing without specific orders what to do with me my two sergeantbailiffs thrust me into that little den of a strongroom below stairswhere I had once found the master of the house and one of them mountedguard whilst the other fetched the camp armorer to iron meThe shackles securely on I was left to content me as I could with thedoor ajar and my two jailers hobnobbing before it Having done all I hadhoped to do there was nothing for it now but to wait upon theconsequences So hitching my chair up to the oaken table I made apillow of my fettered wrists and presently fell adozeI know not what hour of the night it was when the halfblood Scipio whowas Mr Gilbert Stairs bodyservant came in and roused me I startedup suddenly at his touch making no doubt it was my summons But themulatto brought me nothing worse than a cold fowl and a loaf with acandleend to see to eat them by and a dish of hot tea to wash themdownI knew well enough whom I had to thank for this and was set wonderingthat my ladys charity was broad enough to mantle even by this little mylatest sins against the kings cause None the less I ate and drankgratefully draining the teadish to the dregswhich by the by werestrangely bitterI had scarce finished picking the bones of the capon before sleep cameagain to drag at my eyelids a drowsiness so masterful that I could makeno head against it And so with the bitter taste of the tea still on mytongue I fell away a second time into the pit of forgetfulnessWhen I awakened from what seemed in the memory of it the most unrestingsleep I ever had it was no longer night and I was stretched upon theoaken settle in that same lumber garret where I had been bedded throughthat other night of hiding So much I saw at the waking glance and thenI realized vaguely at first but presently with startling emphasisthat it was the westering sun which was shining in at the high roofwindows that the shackles were still on and that my temples werethrobbing with a most skullsplitting headacheBeing fair agasp with astoundment at this new spinning of fates wheelI sprang up quicklyand was as quickly glad to fall back upon thepallet For with the upstart a heaving nausea came to supplement theheadache and for a long time I lay batblind and sick as any landsmanin his first gale at seaThe sunlight was fading from the high windows and I was deep sunk in asick mans megrims before aught came to disturb the silence of thecobwebbed garret From nausea and racking pains I had come to the stageof querulous selfpity Twas monstrous this burying a man alive illfettered uncaredfor to live or die in utter solitude as might happenI could not remotely guess to whom I owed this dismal fate and was toopetulant to speculate upon it But the meddler friend or foe who hadbereft me of my chance to die whilst I was fit and ready came in for aTurkish cursingthe curse that calls down in all the Osmanli variantsthe same pangs in duplicate upon the banned oneIt was in the midst of one of these impotent fits of malediction thatthe wainscot door was opened and closed softly and light footstepstiptoed to my bedside I shut my eyes wilfully when a voice low andtender asked Are you awake Monsieur JohnI hope you will hold me forgiven my dears if I confess that what withthe nausea and the headache the fetters and the solitude I was rabidenough to rail at her Twas so near dusk in the illlighted garret thatI could not see how she took it but she let me know by word of mouthMerci Monsieur she said icily And then Gratitude does not seemto be amongst your giftsAt this I broke out in all a sick mans pettishnessGratitude Mayhap you will tell me what it is I have to be gratefulfor All I craved was the chance to die as a soldier should and someone must needs spoil me of thatSelfishselfish always and to the last she murmured Do you nevergive a moments thought to the feelings of others Captain IretonThis was past all enduranceIf I had not should I be here this moment I raved You do make mesicker than I was my ladyYet I say you are selfish she insisted What have I done that youshould come here to have yourself hanged for a spyLet us have plain speech in Gods name I retorted You know wellenough there was no better way in which I could serve youDo I indeed mon ami she flashed out Let me tell you sir hadshe ever a blush of saving pride Margery Stairor Margery Ireton ifyou like that betterwould kill you with her own hand rather than haveit said her husband died upon a gallowsA sudden light broke in upon me and I went blind in the horror of itGod in Heaven I gasped twas you then I do believe you poisonedme in that dish of tea you sent me last nightShe laughed a bitter little laugh that I hated to think on afterwardYou have a most chivalrous soul Captain Ireton I do not wonder youare so fierce to shake it free of the poor body of clayBut you do not deny it I criedOf what use would it be I have said that I would not have you dieshamefully on the gallows so I may as well confess to the poppyjuicein the tea Tell me Monsieur John was it nasty bitterGood Lord I groaned are you a woman or a fiendEither or both as you like to hold me sir But come what might Isaid you should not die a felons death And you have not as yetBetter a thousand times the rope and tree than that I should rot byinches here with you to sit by and gird at me Ah my lady you arehaving your revenge of meMerci encore Shall I go away and leave youNo not that A cold sweat broke out upon me in a sudden childishhorror of the solitude and the darkness and the fetters And then Iadded But twould be angel kindness if you would leave off torturingme I am but a man dear lady and a sick man at thatAll in a flash her mood changed and she bent to lay a cool palm on mythrobbing templesPoor Monsieur John she said softly I meant not to make you suffermore but rather less Then she found water and a napkin to wring outand bind upon my aching headAt the touch and the word of womanly sympathy I forgot all and thelovemadness came again to blot out the very present memory of how shehad brought me to thisAh that is betterbetter I sighed when the pounding hammers in mytemples gave me some surcease of the agonyThen you forgive me she asked whether jestingly or in earnest Icould not tellThere is none so much to forgive I replied One hopeless day lastsummer I put my life in pledge to you and youin common justice youhave the right to do what you will with itAh now you talk more like my oldtime Monsieur John with the healingswordthrust But that day you speak of was not more hopeless for youthan for meI know it said I thinking only of how the loveless marriage mustgrind upon her But it must needs be hopeless for both till death stepsin to break the bondAgain she laughed that same bitter little laughIndeed it was a great wrong you did that night sir I could wish asheartily as you that it might be undone But this is idle talk Let mesee if this key will fit your manacles I have been all day finding outwho had it and I am not sure it will be the right one after allBut it did prove to be the right one and when the irons were off I feltmore like a man and less like a baited bearThat is better said I drawing breath of unfeigned relief I bear myLord Charles no malice but twas a needless precaution this ironing ofa man who was never minded to run awayBut you are going to run away she said decisively and that assoon as ever you are able to hold a horse between your knees Shall Ibring you another dish of tea Nay never look so horrified I shall notpoison you this timeStay I cried You mean that you are going to help me escape Tis aneedless prolonging of the agony Go and tell the guards where they canfind meShe stopped midway to the wainscot door and turned to give me my answerNo you are a soldier andand I will not be a gallowswidow Do youhear sir If you are so eager to die there is always thebattlefield And with that she left meI may pass over the two succeeding days in the silence I was condemnedto endure through the major part of them After that first visitMargery came only at stated intervals to bring me food and drink and mynurse was an old black beldame either deaf and dumb or else so newlyfrom the Guinea Coast as to be unable to twist her tongue to theEnglishAnd in the foodbringings I could neither make my lady stay nor answerany question this though I was hungering to know what was going onbeyond the walls of my garret prison Indeed she would not even tell mehow I had been spirited away from the two sergeants keeping watch overme in her fathers strongroom below stairs That is Scipios secretshe would say laughing at me and he shall keep itBut in the evening of the third day the mystery bubble was burst and Ilearned from Margerys lips the thing I longed to know Lord Cornwallishad decided to abandon North Carolina and in an hour or two the armywould be in motion for withdrawal to the southwardNow thanks be to God I said most fervently Kings Mountain hasbegun the good work and we shall show Farmer George a thing or two hehad not guessedOn this my lady drew herself up most proudly and her lip curledYou forget sir you are speaking to Mr Gilbert Stairs daughterTrue said I I did forget We are at cross purposes in this as inall things else I crave your pardon MadamHer eyes were snapping by now Never tell me my dears that eyes of thebluegray can not flash fire when they willHow painstakingly you will go about to make me hate you she burstout And then all in the same breath But you will be rid of mepresently for good and allNay then Mistress Margery you are always taking an ell of meaningfor my inch of speech Tis I who should do the riddingMon Dieu she cried in a sudden burst of petulance I am sick todeath of all this Is there no way out of this coil that is stranglingus both Captain IretonI had thought to make a way three days ago did so make it but youkept me from walking in it Yet that way is still openif you will butdrop a word in my Lords ear when you go below stairsOh yesa fine thing the wife betray the husband This with anotherlipcurl of scorn I have some shreds and patches of pride left sirif you have notThen free me of my obligation to you and let me do it myself I am wellenough to hangAnd so make me a consenting accomplice Truly as I have said beforeyou have a most knightly soul Captain IretonI closed my eyes in very wearinessYou are hard to please my ladyYou have not to try to please me sir I am going awaytonightGoing away I echoed Whither if I may askMy father has taken protection and we shall go south with the army AsLord Cornwallis says Mecklenburg is a hornets nest of rebellion andin an hour or two after we are gone you will be amongst your friendsShe made to leave me now but I would not let her go without trying thelast bluntpointed arrow in the quiver of expedientsStay a moment I begged You are leaving the untangling of this coilyou speak of to a chance bullet on a battlefield Had you ever thoughtthat the Church can undo what the Church has doneAgain I had that bitter laugh which was to rankle afterward in memoryYou are a most desperate pertinacious man Captain Ireton Failing allelse you would even storm Heaven itself to gain your end she scoffedthen at the very pitchpoint of the scornful outburst she put her facein her hands and fell asobbing as if her heart would breakI knew not what to say or do and ended manlike by saying and doingnothing And so still crying softly she let herself out at thewainscot door and this was our leavetakingXLIVHOW WE CAME TO THE BEGINNING OF THE ENDIt was on the third day of December a cheerless and comfortless day atthe close of the most inclement autumn I ever remember that the patriotArmy of the South was paraded on the courthouse common in Charlotte tolisten to the reading of General Gatess final order the orderannouncing the arrival of Majorgeneral Greene from Washingtonsheadquarters to take over the command of the field forces in theCarolinasAs members of Colonel William Washingtons lighthorse Richard Jenniferand I were both present at this installation of the new field commanderand it was here that we both had our first sight of Nathaniel Greenethe Hickory QuakerNow the historians as is their wont have pictured Greene the generalto the complete effacement of Greene the man and it is in my mind thatyou may like to see the new commander as we saw him making his firstinspection of Horatio Gatess poor shadow of an army on that dismalDecember day in CharlotteIn years he was rising forty and as weight goes he was a heavy manpressing hard upon fifteen stone with the knuckle of it under hiswaistcoat None the less though his great bulk made him sit his horsemore like a farmer than a soldier he had the muscular shoulders andarms of the anchorsmiths to which trade he had been bredThe hint of grossness which his figure gave was not borne out by hisface Like my Lord Cornwalliss his eyes were womanish large and noseand mouth and the lift of the brow were cast in a mold to match yetthere was that in his face which made it the mask of a soul thoughtfuland serene and his ruddy complexion and fair hair gave him a look ofopenness that a dark man is like to missA skilled soldier with a good promise of strenuous patience was mysumming up of him and Dick saw him as I did though with a moreprophetic eyeHe will make his mark Jack look you not in stubborn infighting atthe barrier mayhap like Dan Morgan nor in a brilliant dash like ourcolonel but in his own anchorsmiths waya heat at a time and a blowat a time said Jennifer and I noddedStirrup to stirrup with the new commander as he passed down the linerode Daniel Morgan big strong masterful handsome the very pick andchoice of leaders for his rough and ready riflemen Like most of hismen he scorned to wear a uniform appearing on parade as in the fieldin a neatfitting huntingshirt of Indiantanned buckskin withfringings of the samea costume that set off his gigantic figure as notailorfine coat could have set it offWhen he pulled his horse down to make it keep step with the sedaterpacings of the generals we could hear him declaring with an oaththat his Eleventh Virginia alone would give a good account of all theTories between the Catawba and the Broad and when the cavalcade passedthe rifle corps the men flung their hats and cheered their leader inopen defiance of all disciplineAh me they tell me that in after years this stout Daniel theLionbearder as we used to dub him became a doddering old man evenas thy old taleteller is now that he put off all his roistering waysand might be found any Lords Day shouting not curses as of yore butpsalm tunes in the church whereof he was a pillar But twas the otherDaniel we knew the bluff hearty man of his two hands who could pummelthe best boxer in his own regiment of fisticuffers who could outcurseoutbuffet and outdrink the hardiest frontiersman on the borderNext conspicuous in the generals suite was our colonel the pink oflighthorse commanders with only Harry Lee in all the patriot rank andfile for his peer Tis a thousand pities that William Washington theMarcellus of the army has had to suffer the eclipse which must dim theluster of all who walk in the shadow of a greater of the same name Forsurely there never was a finer gentleman a truer friend a noblerpatriot or according to his opportunities an abler officer than wasour beloved colonel of the light dragoonsBut this is all beside the mark you will say and you will be chafingrestively to know how Dick and I had come together in this troop ofColonel Washingtons to know this in a word and to pass on at a gallopto the happenings which followed Nay in fancys eye I can see youturning the page impatiently wondering where and when and how thistiresome old wordspinner will make an endAs Margery had promised I passed out of my garret prison and out ofdoor on that memorable evening of October fourteenth to find the Britishgone from Charlotte and the town jubilant with patriotic joyHaving nothing to detain me and being bound in honor by the wish of mydear lady not to follow and give myself up to the retreating Britishgeneral I took horse and rode to Salisbury where I had the great goodfortune to find Dick already breveted a captain in Colonel Washingtonscommand hurrying his troop southward to whip on the British withdrawalHere was my chance to drown heartburnings in an onsweeping tide ofaction and then and there I became a gentleman volunteer in Dickscompany asking nothing of my dear lad save that I might ride at hisstirrup and share his hazardsTouching the hazards there were plenty of them in the seven weekspreceding and the month or more following our new generals coming totake the field as you may know in detail if you care to follow thegallopings of Colonel Washingtons lighthorse troop through the pagesof the histories But these have little or naught to do with my taleand I pass them by with the word you will anticipate that in all thedashes and forays and brushes with the enemys foraging parties andoutposts no British or Tory bullet could find its billet in the man whowas enamored of deathAs for my most miserable entanglement the lapse of time made it neitherbetter nor worse nor greatly different and there was little in all theskirmishings and gallopings to beat off the bandog of conscience orthat other and still fiercer wild beast of starved love that gnawed atme day and nightThough the hope for some easement would now and then lift its head Iwas reminded daily that hope itself was hopeless and when the dayslengthened into weeks and the weeks into months bringing no salving forthe double hurt I knew that time could only make me love Margery themore that there be wounds that heal and others that open afresh ateach remembrance of the hand that gave themOne grain of comfort I had in all these dreary weeks Twas whilst wewere quartering in Charlotte and I had chanced to fall upon thehalfblood Scipio who had been left by Gilbert Stair to be thecaretaker of the deserted town houseAs you will remember twas he who had brought me the drugged tea andthe word I had from him made me hot with shame for the cruel imputationI had put upon my dear lady Yas sar gib um sleepdrop to make buckramassa hol still twell we could tote im froo de window an roun dehouse an up de star Soljah gyards watch um mighty close dat nightyes sar And thus this nightmare thought of mine was turned intoanother thorn to prick me on the selfaccusing side Twas her keenwomans wit and no coldblooded plan to cheat the gallows that madeher give me the sleeping draft Having the objectlesson of my latesurrender before her she had no mind to let me mar the rescue by wakingto forbid it And when I taxed her twas natural pride that drove herto let me go on thinking the unworthy thought if so I wouldI did penance for my disloyalty as a despairing lover might and I dothink it made me tenderer of Dick whose bearing to me through all thesetempestuous weeks was most nobly generous and forgiving I say forgivingbecause I was often but the curstest of companions as you would guessFor when I was not bent upon finding that wicket gate of death whichwould let me from the path of these two I was in a wicked tertian ofthe mind whose chill was of despair and whose fever was a hot desireto look once more into the eyes of my dear lady before the wicket gateshould open for meTwas this desire that finally drew me to herthe desire and anotherthing which shall have mention in its place The new year was now comeand the Southern Army as yet too weak to cope with the enemy was cutinto two wings of observation one under General Greene himself atCheraw Hill the other and lesser in the knoll forests of the Broad withDaniel Morgan for its chief both watching hawklike the downsitting ofmy Lord Cornwallis who seemed to have taken root at WinnsboroughAs you will know Washingtons lighthorse was with Morgan and we atedrank and wellnigh slept in the saddle But for all our scoutings andoutridings and all Dan Morgans hearty cursings at the ill success ofthem we could come by no sure inkling of Lord Cornwalliss designs AsI have said the British commander seemed to have taken root and was nowwaiting to sprout and growIt was at this lackknowledge crisis that I volunteered to go to theBritish camp at Winnsborough in my old quality of spy did this and hadmy leave and orders before Dick learned of itLeft to my own devices I fear I should have slipped away withouttelling Jennifer But as so many times before fate intervened to driveme where I had not meant to go On the morning set for my departure Iwoke to find a letter pinned to the ground beside me with an Indianscalpingknife thrust through itDick was sitting by the newlykindled fire nursing his knees and mostpalpably waiting for me to wake and find my missiveWhat is it I asked eying the ominous thing distrustfullyTis a letter as you see Uncanoola left it Then most surlilyTis from Madge and to you There is your name on the back of itAt this I must needs read the letter with the lad looking on as if hewould eat me Twas dated at Winnsborough and was brief and to thepoint    Monsieur    When last we met you said the Church might undo what the Church had    done I have spoken to the good Pre Matthieu and he has consented    to write to the Holy Father at Rome But it is necessary that he    should have your declaration Since the matter is of your own    seeking mayhap you can devise a way to communicate with Pre    Matthieu who is at present with us under our borrowed roof hereThat was all and it was signed only with her initial I read it throughtwice and then again to gain time For Dick was waitingTis a mere formal matter of business said I when I could put himoff no longerBusiness he queried the red light of suspicion coming and going inhis eye What business can you have with Mistress Madge Stair prayTis aboutit touches the title to Appleby Hundred said Iequivocating as clumsily as a schoolboy caught in a fault Of courseyou know that the confiscation act of the North Carolina Congressreestablished my right and title to the estateNo said he you never told me Then She writes you about thisAbout a matter touching it as I sayAs you did not say he growled after which a silence came and satbetween us I holding the open letter in my hand and he staring gloomilyat the back of itWhen the silence grew portentous I told him of my design to go aspyingHe looked me in the eye and his smile was not pleasant to seeYou are lying most clumsily Jack or at best you are telling me buthalf the truth You are going to see Mistress MargeryThat is altogether as it may happen I retorted striving hard to keepdown the flame of insensate rivalry which his accusings always kindledin meIt is not Winnsborough is neither London nor yet Philadelphia thatyou may miss her in the crowd And you do not mean to miss herWell And if I do chance to see herwhat thenDont mad me Jack You should know by this what a fool she has made ofmeTis your own folly I rejoined hotly You should blame neither thelady nor the man to whom she has given nothing saveSave what he broke in savagelyI recoiled on the brink as I had so many times before The months ofwaiting for the death I craved had hardened meSave a thing you would value lightly enough without her love Let ushave done with this bickering find the colonel and ask his leave to gowith me if you like Then you may do the lovemaking whilst I do thespyingNo said he not while you stand it upon such a leg as thatI reached across and gripped his hand and wrung it Shall we never havethe better of these senseless vaporings I cried Tis as you say Ican neither live sane nor die mad without another sight of her Dickand that is the plain truth And yet mark me this next seeing of herwill surely set a thing in train that will make her yours and not mineGet your leave and come with me on your own terms Mayhap she will showyou how little she cares for me and how much she cares for youSo this is how it came about that we two garbed as decent planters andmounted upon the sleekest cobs the regiment afforded took the road forWinnsborough together on a certain summerfine morning in January in theyear of battles seventeen hundred and eightyoneXLVIN WHICH WE FIND WHAT WE NEVER SOUGHTTis fifty miles as a bird would fly it from the grazing uplands of theBroad known as the Cowpens to the lower plantation region lying betweenthat stream and the farther Catawba or Wateree and Richard Jennifer andI ambled the distance leisurely as befitted our mission and disguisecutting the journey evenly in half for the first nights lodging whichwe had at the house of one Philbrickas hot a Tory as we pretended tobeFrom our host of the night we learned that within two days the Britishoutposts on the Wateree and the Broad had been advanced and there wererumors in the air that Lord Cornwallis who was hourly expecting GeneralLeslie with two thousand of Sir Henry Clintons men from New York wouldpresently move on to the longdeferred conquest of North CarolinaHas Cornwallis lost his wits Dick would say when we were ajog onthe southward road again Tis a braver lordling than I gave him creditfor beingif he will put his head in a trap that will close behind himand cut him off from his line and baseI laughed You may wager Jennifer House against an acre of the Cowpensthat Lord Charles will do no such unsoldierly thing If this rumor betrue we have heard only the half of itAnd the other half will beThat my Lord Cornwallis will do his prettiest to pull the teeth of oneor the other of the trapjaws before he trusts himself within themJennifer was silent for an ambling minute or two Then he said Twillbe our teeth hell try to pull then The Broad is nearer than thePedee and ours is the weaker of the two jawsRight you are said I And now we know what we have to discoverAnan he queriedWe must learn by hook or crook who is to be sent against Dan Morganand whenThat should be easyif the use of it afterward be not choked out of usat a ropes endWe can divide the ropesend chance of failure by two We may worktogether as the opportunity offers but once within the lines we mustpass as strangers to each other or at most as chance acquaintances ofthe roadGood said he and then his jaw dropped But what if one of us betaken Never ask me to stand by strangerwise and see you hanged JackI shall both ask it and promise to do the same by you Your hand on itbefore we go a step farther if you pleaseTis out of all reason he demurredTis the only reasonable course Bethink you this is no knighterrantventure we are two of Dan Morgans soldiers bent upon doing a thingmost needful for the welfare of the country and its cause Tis a dutyhigher than any obligation friendship lays on Richard Jennifer or JohnIretonAt this he yielded the point though I could see that the proposaljumped little with the promptings of his generous heartTis a scurvy trap you have set for me he grumbled The risk ischiefly yours and you know it You are known to Lord Cornwallis and toGod knows how many more of them and belikeThe interruption came in the shape of a troop of redcoat horsemengalloping in the road to meet us and we were shortly surrounded and putsharply to the question We answered each for himself Dick was aloyalist from Yorkville way eager to be set in arms against the banditDaniel Morgan I was a refugee from hornetsnest Mecklenburg alsobent upon revengeThe troop officer passed us on something doubting as I suspected Butwe were riding in the right direction and he was unwilling to cloghimself with a pair of plain country gentlemen held in leash asprisonersA few miles farther down the road the same brace of lies got us safelythrough the loosely drawn vedette line and by evening we were in sightof our goalViewing it from the rising ground of approach Winnsborough appearedless as a town than as a partly fortified camp The few houses of thevillage were lost in the field of tents huts and troop shelters andmeasuring by the spread of these it would seem that my LordCornwalliss army had been considerably augmented since I had last seenit in Charlotte I spoke of this but Dick was intent upon the businessof the momentAye there are enough of them God knows But tell me JackIm new tothis gamewhats to do first when we are among themI laughed at him You are my troop commander Captain Jennifer Tisfor you to make the dispositionsHave your joke and be hanged to you There are no captains hereIf you leave it to me we shall ride boldly to the tavern put up astravelers and listen to the gossips each for himself I replied andthis is what we didThe village tavern servilely bearing the kings arms thinly paintedover the palmetto tree of South Carolina on its swinging signboard wasa miserable doggery full to overflowing with a riffraff of carousingsoldiery Separating by mutual consent in the public taproom Richardand I presently drifted together again at a small table in a cornerwith a black boy in attendance to set before us such poor entertainmentas the hostelry affordedWell what luck asked Dick mumbling it behind his hand though hemight safely have shouted it aloud in the din and clamor of the placeI shook my head Nothing as yet save that I overheard a tipsy corporaltelling his tipsier sergeant that the officers would be holding a reveltonight at a Tory manor house situate somewhere beyond the campconfines to the northward the house of one Master Marmaduke Harndon ifI heard the name aright Then I added This rabble is too drunken toserve our purpose Tis only the common soldiery and we shall learnnothing hereThere was at least one who was not a ranker said Dick and there wassomething akin to awe in his voice Then he leaned across the table towhisper Jack Ive fair had a frightI smiled Fear of God man or the devil was not one of the ladsweaknessesYou may grin as you please he went on but answer me this do thedead come back to lifeNot this side of the resurrection reveille if we may believe thedominiesThen I have seen a ghosta most horrible mask of a man we both know toour costName him and I will tell you whether he be a ghost or noTis the ghost of Frank Falconnet or else it is what of the manhimself the fire hath left said Dick and I marked his shiver at thewordNo said II tell you yesI sprang up but the lad reached across the table and smote me back intothe chairSoftly old firebrand twas you who said the public matter must takeprecedence of the private Moreover if this be Francis Falconnet whom Ihave seen your sweetest revenge on him will be to let him liveas heisI will kill him as I would a wild beast I raged thinking of thatmidnight scene in the great forest when my sweet lady had gone on herknees to this fiend in human guise And so should you I added ifyou care aught for the honor of the woman who loves youBut now it was this hotheaded Richard I have drawn for you who sawfarthest and clearestAll in good time he said coolly At this present we have DanMorgans fish to fry and sitting here saucing this devils mess of asupper with thoughts of private revenge will never fry it Set your witsat work Falconnets ghost has put mine hopelessly out of gear Ye godsbut twas a most fearsome thing to look atI did not answer him at once and whilst I plied knife and fork for thesake of appearances I would think upon what he had discovered Thisreappearance of Francis Falconnet was not to be passed over lightlyWhat would he do or seek to do Nay what devilish thing was it hemight not do If the fire had burned his passion out it had doubtlesskindled a feller blaze of revenge And if his thirst was for vengeancehow could he quench it in a deeper draft than by harrying the woman weboth loved Twas only by a mighty effort that I could drag myself backto Dicks urging and the needs of the hourTo have some chance of hearing gossip to our purpose we must makeshift to gain admittance to this officers rout at the manor house IsaidThe devil quoth Dick I venture thats easier said than donefortwo plain country gentlemenNever fear there will be others there lacking fine clothes and so thethrong be great enough we may pass current in itRichard pushed his plate back with a grimace of disgustLet us be at it then Another grapple with this pigbait will finishme outrightA halfhour later we were tethering our cobs at the already crowdedhitchingrail in front of a goodly mansion some mile or more beyond thecamp limits on the northward road a rambling manor house to the full aslarge as Appleby Hundred with a shaven lawn in front and withinlights and music and sounds of revelryBy the Lord Harry but this Master Harndon would seem to be a man ofsubstance says Dick And then Can you pick out a good horse in thedark Jack It may come to a race for our necks by and by and thesecobs of ours are too broadbacked for speedI said I could and so we went deeper into the cavalcade at thehitchrail and marked out two cleanlimbed chargers a gray and asorrel this before we gave the final touches to our plan of action andpassed up the broad avenue to the manor houseXLVIHOW OUR PIECE MISSED FIRE AT HARNDON ACRESFor a doorkeeper some one or another of the officer guests had set asergeant on guard but though the night was yet young the man passed usinto the great entrance hall with a hiccough and a wink that spoke thusearly of an open house and freely flowing good cheerAs we had hoped to find it this rout at Master Harndons was a stiflingjam and a good half of the guests were in civilian plain clothesneither Paris nor London having as yet reached so far into the Carolinaplantations to proscribe homespun and to prescribe the gay toggeries ofthe courts This for the men I hasten to add for then as now ourAmerican dames and maids would put a years cropping of a plantation ontheir backs thinking nothing of it and there was no lack of shimmeringsilks and stiff brocades of highpiled coiffures paint patches andpowder at this merrymaking at Harndon AcresLacking an introducer and wanting moreover nothing save the leave tohave standingroom in the throng as lookerson we gave Mr MarmadukeHarndon a sleek rotund little gentleman smirking and bowing andtapping the lid of his silver snuffbox a wide berth and with anagreement to meet later for the comparing of notes Jennifer and I wentapart at the door of the ballroom each to lose himself in theassembled company as an otter slips into a pool namely withoutruffling itTwas easily done Winnsborough had by this time become a refuge campfor all the loyalists in the region roundabout and there were many inthe present company who were strangers one to another uneasy shiftingfigures in the gay throng beneath the notice alike of haughty dames andprinking dandy officers Beneath the notice I say yet I would qualifythis for more than one of the epauletted macaronis trod upon my toes orbustled me rudely in the crush till I trembled not for my ownselfcontrol but for Richards making sure that the lad was having nomore gentlemanly welcome than ITwas with some notion of finding ampler room for my feet that I edgedaway through the fringing wallcrowd in the dancingroom toward acurtained archway at the back As yet I had overheard naught save thesilly persiflage of the belles and beauxa word here and anotherthereand I was beginning to fear that this was as poor a place to lookfor information as was the pothouse when a thing befell to set meaquiver with all the thrillings the human heartstrings can thrum to inone and the same instant of timeI had shouldered my way out of the ballroom medley and into the lesscrowded room at the back This proved to be a rear withdrawingroomserving for the nonce as a refectory There were little groups and knotsof chatterers standing about fair maids each with her ring ofredcoated courtiers laughing and jesting or picking daintily at theviands on the great oaken table in the midstRounding the promontory of the tablesend to come to anchor in somequiet eddy where I could listen unnoticed for the word I was thirstingfor I must needs entangle the button of my coatcuff in the delicatelace of a ladys sleeve in passingThe wearer of the sleeve had her back to me and I saw the whiteshoulders go up in a little shrug of petulance whilst I sought todisentangle the button Then she turned to face me and the words ofapology froze on my lips Twas Mistress Margery standing at easewithgood heavens with Richard Jennifer and Colonel Banastre Tarletonfor her companyHere was a halter with a double snaffle at the end of it was thethought that flashed upon me and I was gathering my wits to brazen itout in some such manner as to leave Jennifer unattainted when my ladygive a little start and a shriekLa Mr Septimus how you startled me she cried Then without atremor of the lip or a pause for breathtaking she presented meColonel Tarleton Mr Septimus Ireton of Iretondene in Virginia Andnext to Dick Mr Richard my very good friend Mr IretonTwas done so cleverly and with such an air that even Dick who hadknown her from childhood was struck dumb with admiration as his facesufficiently advertised And indeed I had much ado to play my own partwith any decent selfpossession though I did make shift to bow stifflyand to say I see I should have brought the Iretondene title deeds withme to make you sure that I am not my rebel cousin John MistressMargery Your servant Colonel Tarleton and yours Mr RichardDicks bow was an elaborate hiding of his telltale face but thecolonels was the slightest of nods and I could feel the sloeblackeyes of him boring into my very soulHad my lady given him but a moments time I make no doubt he would havecome instantly at the truth and the little farce would have been turnedinto a tragedy on the spot But she gave him no time The spinet in theballroom alcove was tinkling out the overture to a minuet and she laidthe tips of her dainty fingers on the colonels armThis will be ours to walk through will it not Colonel Tarleton shesaid playing the sprightly minx to the very climax of perfection Thenshe dipped us a curtsy Au revoir gentlemen Tis a thousand pitiesyou had not joined sooner and so had the red coat and smallsword tograce you hereWhen they were gone Dick laughed sardonicallySaw you ever such a coolblood little jade in all your life Twas withme as it was with you I too stumbled upon them and the colonelbustled me and set his heel on my foot I daresay I should have hadmyself in irons in another moment but for Madge She slipped in betweenand introduced us as sweetly as you pleaseNevertheless said I the colonel recognized us bothNo Think you soTis certain enough to play upon What we do now must be done quicklyor not at all What have you overheardHe swore softly Never a cursed word less than nothing of any interestto Dan MorganWe must try again Twill surely be talked of here if the army is aboutto move Do you take a turn in the anteroom and meet me in a quarter ofan hour at the outer doorAt the word Dick promptly lost himself in the throng whilst I made aslow circuit of the refreshment table Once I thought I had the cluewhen a girl hanging on the arm of an infantry lieutenant said Will itbe true that you will presently go out to hunt the rebels down MrThornicroft But the prudent lieutenant smiled and put her offcleverly leaving his fair questionerand menone the wiserI went on drifting aimlessly from group to group and dallying of setpurpose If I had read Colonel Tarletons glance aright the momentswere growing diamondprecious but as yet neither half of my errand wasdone Come what might I must see Margery again and have her tell mewhere and how to find the priest and twas borne in upon me that shewould come back to seek me as soon as she could be free of her partnerin the danceThe forecast as to my lady had its fulfilment while yet the spinetterwas striking out the final chords of the minuet A lady dropped herkerchief and I was before her swain in stooping to pick it up As Ibowed low in returning the bit of lace to its owner a voice that I hadlearned to know and love whispered in my earMake your way to the clock landing of the stair I must have speechwith you it said and for a wonder I was cool enough to obey with nomore than a sidelong glance at my lady passing on the arm of anotherepauletted danglerShe was before me at the meeting place and there was no laughingwelcome in the deepwelled eyes Instead they flashed me a look thatmade me winceWhat folly is this sir she demanded Will you never have donetaking my honor and your own life into your reckless handsI bowed my head to the storm With the dagger of my miserable errandsticking in my heart there was no fight in meI am but come to do your bidding I said slowly for the words costme sorely in the coin of anguish I had your letter and if you willsay how I may find Father MatthieuShe broke me in the midst Mon Dieu she cried Could I guess thatyou would come here into the very noose of the gallows Oh how you doheap scorn on scorn upon me Once you made me give silent consent to afalsehood you told twice nay thrice you have made me disloyal to theking and now you come again to make me look the world in the face andtell a smiling lie to shield you O Holy Mother pity me And with thisshe put her face in her hands and began to sobNow we were only measurably isolated on the stair and some sense of thehazard we tooka hazard involving her as well as Richard andmyselfsteadied me with a sudden shockControl yourself I whispered What is done is done and the miseryis not all yours to suffer Tell me how I may find the priest and Iwill do my errand and begoneYou can not stay to find him nowyou must not she insisted comingout of the fit of despair with a rebound He is in the townindeed Iknow not where he is just now Can you not endure it a little longerCaptain IretonNo said I sullenly I have been living a lie all these months tothe friend I love best and I will not do it moreCould I be mistaken Surely there was a flash not of anger in the eyesthat were lifted to mine and a tremulous note of eagerness in thevoice that said Then Dick does not knowyou have not told himNo I have told no onePoor Dick she said softly I thought he knew and IShe paused and in the pause it flashed upon me how she had wronged mydear lad how she had thought he would make brazen love to her knowingshe was the wife of another I thanked God in my heart that I had beenable to right him thus farAfter a time she said Why did you make me marry you Monsieur JohnOh I have racked my brain so for the answer to that question I knowyou said it was to save my honor But surely we have paid a heavierpenalty than any that could have been laid upon me had you left me as IwasI was but a shortsighted fool and no prophet I rejoined strivinghard to keep the bitterness of soul out of my words At the moment itseemed the only way out of the pit of doubt into which my word toColonel Tarleton had plunged you But there was another motive You sawthe paper I signed that night with Lieutenant Tybee and your fathersfactor for the witnessesYesDo you know what it wasNoTwas the last will and testament of one John Ireton gentleman inwhich he bequeathed to Margery his wife his estate of ApplebyHundredAppleby Hundred she echoed But my fatherYour father holds but a confiscators title and it with many othershas been voided by the Congress of North Carolina Richard Jennifer ismy dear friend and youI begin to understanda little she said and now her voice was lowand she would not look at me Then in the same low tone But nownowyou would be free againHow can you ask As matters stand I have marred your life and Dicksmost hopelessly Do you wonder that I have been reckless of the hangmanthat I care no jot for my interfering life at this moment save as thetaking of it may involve you and RichardNo surely she said still speaking softly And now she gave me hereyes to look into and the hardness was all melted out of them Did youcome here under the shadow of the gallows to tell me this MonsieurJohnThere shall be no more halfconfidences between us dear lady I had myleave of General Morgan on the score of our need for better informationof Lord Cornwalliss designs but I should have come in anycasewanting the leave my commission as a spy or any other excuseTo tell me thisTo do the bidding of your letter and to say that whilst I live I shallbe shamed for the bitter words I gave you when I was sickI mind them not I had forgotten them she saidBut I have not forgotten nor ever shall Will you say you forgive meMargeryFor thinking I had poisoned you How do you know I did notI have seen Scipio Will you shrive me for that disloyalty dear ladyDid I not say I had forgotten itThank you I said meaning it from the bottom of my heart Now onething more and you shall send me to Father Matthieu Tis a shamefulthing to speak of but the thought of it rankles and will rankle till Ihave begged you to add it to the things forgotten That morning in yourdressingroomShe put up her hands as if she would push the words backSpare me sir she begged There are some things that must always beunspeakable between us and that is one of them But if it will help youto knowthat I knowhowhow you came thereShe was flushing most painfully and I was scarce more at ease Buthaving gone thus far I must needs let the thought consequent slip intowordsYour fathers motives have ever been misunderstandable to me Whatcould he hope to gain by such a thingI had no sooner said it than I could have bitten my masterless tongueFor in the very voicing of the wonder I saw or thought I saw GilbertStairs purpose Since I had not made good my promise to die and leavethe estate to Margery he would at least make sure of his daughtersdowry in it by putting it beyond us to set the marriage aside as a thingbegun but not completed So having this behindtime flash of afterwitI made haste to efface the question I had askedYour pardon I pray you I see now tis a thing we must both bury outof sight But to the otherthe matter which has brought me hither willyou put me in the way of finding Father MatthieuWe had talked on through the measures of a cotillion and the dancerswarm and wearied were beginning to fill the entrance hall below Ourpoor excuse for privacy would be gone in a minute or two and she spokequicklyYou shall see Father Matthieu and I will help you But you must notlinger here In a few days the army will be moving northwardOhheavens what have I saidNothing I cut in swiftly you are speaking now to your husbandnotto the spy Go on if you pleaseWe shall return to Appleby Hundred within the fortnight There if youare stillif you desire it you may meet the good cur andA muchbepowdered captain of cavalry was coming up the stair to claimher and I was fain to let her go But at my passing of her to the stepbelow I whispered I shall keep the trystmy first and last with youdear lady AdieuSo soon as she was gone I made haste to find Richard having as Ifeared greatly overstayed my appointment to meet him at the door Hewas not among the promenaders in the hall so I began to drift againthrough the ballroom and so on to where the spread table stood ringedwith its groups of nibblers I had made no more than half the round ofthe refectory when I saw Margery standing in the curtained arch lookingthis way and that with anxious terror written plainly in her faceWhat is it I asked when she had found me outTis the worst that could happen she whispered You are discoveredboth of you Colonel Tarleton was too shrewd for us He has let it beknown among the officers that there are two spies in the house andnowHark what is thatWe were standing in a deep windowbay and I drew the curtain an inch ortwo The air without was filled with the trampling of hoofbeats ongreensward A lighthorse troop was surrounding the manor houseI drew her arm in mine and led her back to the ballroom twas now cometo this that open publicity was our best safeguard We must findDick said I Have you seen himNoTogether we made the slow circuit of the dancingroom but Jennifer wasnot to be found Out of the tail of my eye I saw a soldier slipping inhere and there to stand statuelike against the wall This brought itto a matter of minutes of seconds mayhap and still we looked in vainfor DickOh why did you bring him here He will surely be taken Her voice wastremulous with fear and I answered as I could being sore at heart inspite of all that her chief concern should be for RichardBut by now my purpose was well taken and though it appeared thatRichard Jennifer was more than ever my successful rival I pledge youmy dears I had no thought of leaving him behind So we made anotherslow round of the rooms and whilst we were looking for Dick I spoke inguarded whispers to warn my lady of Falconnets return But the warningwas not neededHer shudder of loathing shook the hand on my arm That man OhMonsieur John I fear him day and night If I could but run away but weare not finding Dickwe must find him quicklyThere was no other place to look save in the entrance hall and at thedoor one of the statuelike soldiers took two steps aside and barred theway I faced about and we plunged once again into the throng but notbefore I had had a glimpse of Richard in the hall beyond When thechance offered I bent to whisperDick is in the hall looking for me go you to him and warn him I maynot pass the door as you have seenHe will not escape without you she demurredTell him he must Tell him I say he mustShe glanced over her shoulder with a look in her eyes that made me thinkof a wounded bird fluttering in the net of the fowlerOh tis hard hard she murmuredI snatched the word from her lips To choose between love and wifelyduty Then I make it a command Go quicklyShe went at that and I made my way slowly to the far side of theballroom taking post in a deeprecessed window giving upon the lawnThough it was January and the night was chill and raw the rooms weresummer warm with the breath of the crush and some one had swung thecasementWithout I could hear the horses of the waiting troop champingrestlessly at their bits and now and again the low gentling words ofthe riders Why the colonel did not spring his trap at once I could notguess though I learned later that he had magnified our twoman spyingventure into a patriot foray meant to capture the whole houseful ofBritish officers at a swoop and was taking his measures accordinglyTwas while I was listening to the champing horses that I heard my namewhispered in the darkness beyond the open casement I turned slowly andthe nearest of the soldier watchers began to edge his way toward mywindowTis IDick Jennifer whispered the voice without Swing thecasement a little wider and out with you Be swift about it for GodssakeI am fair trapped I whispered back Make off as you canAnd leave you behind So much I heard and then came sounds of astruggle the breathcatchings of two men locked in a stranglers holda smothered oath or two a fall on the turf under the window followedby the soft thudding of fist blows I could bear it no longer Theedging soldier had come within arms reach and when I swung thecasement a little wider he laid a hand on my shoulderIn the name of the king he said and this was all he had time orleave to say For at the summons I drove my fist against the point ofhis wagging jaw to send him plunging among the dancers and the recoilof the blow carried me clear of the windowseat with what a din andclamor of a hue and cry to speed the parting guest as you may figure foryourselvesThe alighting ground of the leap was the body of Dicks late antagonistlying prone beneath the window ledge but the lad himself was up andready to catch me when I stumbled over the vanquished oneTis legs for it now he cried Make for the avenue and the horses atthe hitchrailAt rising twenty a man may run fast and far at rising forty he maystill run far if the first hundred yards do not burst his bellows Sowhen we had darted through the thin line of encircling horsemen and wereflying down the broad avenue with all the troopers who had caught sightof us thundering at our heels Dick was the pacesetter whilst I madebut a shifty second gasping and panting and dying a thousand deaths inthe effort to catch my second windCourage shouted Dick flinging the word back over his shoulder as heran There is help ahead if we can live to reach the gateBut luckily for me the help was nearer at hand Half way down theboxbordered drive when I was at my last gasp the shrill yell of theborder partizans rose from the shrubbery on the right and a voice thatI shall know and welcome in another world cried outStiddy boys stiddy till ye can see the whites o their eyes Nowthen give it to em hot and heavyA haphazard banging of guns followed and the pursuit drew rein in someconfusion giving us time to reach the great gate and the horserailand to loose and mount the gray and the sorrel we had marked outWhilst we were about this last Ephraim Yeates came loping down theavenue and through the gate to vault into the saddle of the first horsehe could lay hands on and so it was that we three took the northwardroad in the silver starlight with the pursuit now in order again and infull cry behind usTwas not until we had safely run the gantlet of the vedette lines by abypath known to the old hunter and had shaken off the troopers thatwere following that I found time to ask what had become of the men whohad formed the ambush in the shrubberyThe old man gave me his dry chuckle of a laughTwas the same old roose de geer as the downcountry Frenchers udsay I stole the drunken sergeants gun and two others and let em offone to a time As for the screechin one bazoos as good as a dozen ifso be ye blow it fierce enoughTwas cut and dried beforehand Dick explained I had an inkling ofwhat was afoot from Ephraim here whom I stumbled on when I droppedfrom the stair window that Madge opened for me He went to set hisoneman ambush whilst I was trying to warn youSo said I Our skins are whole but after all we have come off withnever a word to take back to Dan Morganunless you have the wordNot I Dick said ruefullyThe old man chuckled againYe aint old enough neither one o ye ez I allow It takes a rightold person to fish out the innards of an inimys secrets ColonelTarleton hoss foot and dragoons with the seventh rigiment and a parto the seventyfirst will take the big road for Dan Morgans camptomorrow at sunup And right soon atterwards Ginral Cornwallisllfoller on Is that what you youngsters was trying to find outXLVIIARMS AND THE MANIn that book he wrotethe book in which he never so much as names thename of Iretonmy Lord Cornwalliss commissarygeneral CharlesStedman damns Colonel Tarleton in a most gentlemanly manner for hisillsuccess at the Cowpens and would charge to his account personal thefailure of Cornwalliss plan to crush in detail the patriot Army of theSouthNow little as I love or have cause to love Sir BanastreTarletonthey tell me he has been knighted and now wears amajorgenerals swordknottis but the part of outspoken honestenmity to say that we owed the victory at the Cowpens to no remissnesson the part of the young legion commander who if he were indeed themost brutal was also the most active and enterprising of LordCornwalliss field officersNo it was no remissness nor lack of bravery on the part of the enemyTwas only that the tide had turned Kings Mountain had been fought andwon and there were to be no more Camdens for usIn the affair at the cow pastures which followed hard upon Richardsand my return from our flying visit to Winnsborough the very elementsfought for us and against the British As for instance Tarleton withhis famous legion of horse and infantry enough to make his numbersexceed ours began his march on the eleventh and was rained on and miredfor four long days before he had crossed the Broad and had come withinscouting distance of usLeft to himself Dan Morgan would have locked horns with the enemy atthe fording of the Pacolet but in the council of war our colonel andJohn Howard of the Marylanders were for drawing Tarleton still deeperinto the wilderness and farther from the British main which was bythis moved up as far as Turkey Creek So we broke camp hastily and fellback into the hill country and on the night of the sixteenth took poston the northern slope of a low ridge between two running streamsFor its backbone our force had some three hundred men of the Marylandline and two companies of Virginians These formed our main and wereposted on the rising ground with John Howard for their commander Ahundred and fifty paces in their front partly screened in the openpine oak and chestnut wooding of the ground were Pickenss Caroliniansand the Georgians militiamen it is true but skilled riflemen andevery man of them burning hot to be avenged on Tarletons pillagersStill farther to the front disposed as right and left wings ofoutliers were Yeates and his fellow borderers and some sixty of theGeorgians set to feel the enemys approach and in the reserve postedwell to the rear of the Marylanders and Virginians was our owncolonels troop guarding the horses of the dismounted GeorgiansTwas when we were all set in order to await the suns rising and theenemys approach that Dan Morgan rode the lines and harangued us He wasbetter at giving and taking shrewd blows than at speechmaking but weall knew his mettle well by now and I think there was never a man of usto laugh at his unwonted grandiloquence and solemn periods In theharangue the two battle lines had their orders to be steady to aimlow and above all to hold their fire till the enemy was within surekilling distanceTis a brave old Daniel said Dick whilst the general was sawing theair for the benefit of the South Carolinians Twill not be his faultif we fail But you are older at this business than any of us Jackwhat think you of our chancesI laughed and the laugh was meant to be grim I knew the temper of theBritish regulars and how when well led they could play the hammer toanybodys anvilAny raw recruit can prophesy before the fact said I We haveTarleton his legion the Seventh a good third of the Seventyfirstand two pieces of artillery in our front If they do not give a goodaccount of themselves twill be because Tarleton has marched themlegstiff to overtake usDick fell silent for the moment and when he spoke again some of DanMorgans solemnity seemed to have got into his bloodI have a sort of coward inpricking that I shant come out of this witha whole skin Jack and theres a thing on my mind that mayhap you cantake off You have had Madge to yourself a dozen times since that daylast autumn when I asked her for the hundredth time to put me out ofmisery As I have said she would not hear me through but she gave me alook as I had struck her with a whip Can you tell me whyThe morning breeze heralding the sunrise was whispering to the leaflessbranches overhead and there was nothing in all Dame Natures peacefulsetting of the scene to hint at the impending warclash Yet the warportent was abroad in all the peaceful morning and my mood marched withthe lads when I gave him his answerTruly I could tell you Richard and it is your due to know it from noother lips than mine Mayhap a little later when restitution can gohand in hand with repentance and confessionNo no he cut in quickly Tell me now Jack your little later maybe all too latefor me Does she love youhas she said she lovesyouNay dear lad she despises me well and truly and has never missed thechance of saying so Wait but a little longer and I pledge you on thehonor of a gentleman you shall have her for your very own Will thatcontent youAt my assurance his mood changed and in a twinkling he became thedauntless soldier who fights not to die but to win and liveWith that word to keep me I shall not be killed today I promise youJack and that in spite of this damned queasiness that was showing methe burying trench And then he added softly God bless herI could say amen to that most heartily did it and would have gone onto add a benison of my own but at the moment there were sounds ofgalloping horses on our front and presently three redcoated officersone of them the redoubtable Colonel Tarleton himself rode out toreconnoitre us most coollyI doubt if he would have been so rash had he known that Yeates and hisborderers were concealed in easy pistolshot but the simultaneouscracking of a dozen rifles warned and sent the trio scuttling back tocoverDick swore piteously with the snapshot skirmishers for a target Thefumblers he raged Twas the chance of a lifetime and they allmissed like a lot of boys at their first deer stalkingThey will have another chance and that speedily I ventured andtruly the chance did not tarryFrom our view point on the rising ground we could see the enemy formingunder cover of the wood and as we looked the two pieces of cannonwere thrust to the front to bellow out the signal for the assaultTwas a sight to stir the blood when the enemy broke cover into theopener wooding of the field to the tune of the roaring cannon thevolleyings of small arms and the defiant huzzaings of the men The sunwas just peering over the summit of Thicketty Mountain and his levelrays fell first upon the charging line sweeping in like a tidal wave ofred death to crumple our skirmishers before itLord says Richard if Yeates and the Indian come alive out ofthatBut the outliers closed upon our first line in decent good order firingas they could and in less time than it takes to write it down theonsweeping wave of red was upon the Carolinians We looked to see themilitia fire and run homeguard fashion but these men of Pickensswere made of more soldierly stuff They took the fire of the assaultingline like veterans giving ground only when it came to the bayonet pushThat fetches it to us said Richard most coolly drawing his claymorewhen the Carolinians began to come home like spindrift ahead of the waveof red Then he had a steadying word for the men of his company and ahearty shout and a curse for some of the Georgians who had cut aroundthe flanks of our main to come at their horses in the rearBut the lads assertion that our time was come was only a halfprophecy The Marylanders with the Virginians on either flank stoodfirm giving the onrushing wave a shock that went near to breaking itBut the British were better bayoneted than we and when it came to theiron our lads must needs give ground sullenly fighting their waybackward as a stubborn assault fights its way inch by inch forwardHere come their reserves said Dick pointing with his blade to asecond red line forming in the farther vistas of the wood Lord shallwe never get into itTwas just here that an order sent by Colonel Howard to his firstcompany directing it to charge by the flank came near costing us arout The order was misunderstoodtwas received at the precise momentof the upcoming of the British reservesand the Marylanders fell backIn the turning of a leaf our entire fighting front gave way and what ofthe Georgians there were left in the mellay made a frantic dash for thehorsesAt this crisis John Howard saved the day for us by shrewdly executingthe most difficult manoeuver that is ever essayed by a field officer inthe heat of battle Suffering his men to drift backward until the enemysure now of success were rushing on in disorder to give the coup degrce he gave the quick command About face Fire ChargeI saw the volley delivered in the faces of the redcoats at pikes lengthrange saw the Virginians on the flanks bend to encircle the enemy sawthe rout transfer itself at the roar of the muskets from our side to therecoiling British Then I heard Dicks shouted command Charge themlads theyre sabering the GeorgiansA section of Tarletons horse had hewed its way past our flank and wasat work on the militiamen scrambling for their mounts At it we wentwith our brave colonel a horses length ahead of the best rider in thetroop pistols banging and sword blades whistling and that othercurious sound you will hear only when the cavalry engagesthe heavydunch of the horses coming together like huge living missiles hurledfrom catapultsTwas soon over and the enemy horse and foot was flying in hopelessconfusion through the open wood Our troop led the pursuit and thisbrings me to an incident in which thy old chroniclerfiguring in thehistories as an unnamed sergeanthad his shareIt was in the hot part of the chase and Colonel Tarletona true Britonin this that he would be first in the charge and last in theretreatwas galloping with two of his aides in rear of the dragoonsSince many of us knew the British commander by sight there was a greatclappingto of spurs to overtake and cut him off In this race threehorses outdistanced all the others the great bay ridden by ColonelWashington a snappy little gray bestridden by the colonels boy buglerand my own mountWhen the crisis came our colonel had the wind of the boy and me andwas calling on Colonel Tarleton to surrender at discretion For answerthe three British officers wheeled and fell upon him Never was a mannearer his death In a whiff Tarleton was foining at him in frontwhilst the two aides were rising in their stirrups on either hand to cuthim downTwas the little bugler boy who saved his colonels life and not theunnamed sergeant as the histories have it Having neither a sword northe strength to wield one the boy reined sharp to the left and pistoledhis man as neatly as you please Seeing his fellow sabreur drop hisweapon and clap his hand to the pistolwound my man hesitated just longenough to let me in with the clumsiest of upcuts to spoil the muscles ofhis sword arm This transferred the duel to the two principals who werenow at it hammer and tongs Both were good swordsmen but of the twainour colonel was far the cooler So when Tarleton made to end it with asavage thrust in tierce Washington parried deftly and his point foundhis antagonists sword handAt this Tarleton dropped his bladeit hangs now over thechimneypiece in Mr Washingtons town house in Charlestongave thesignal for flight and the three Britons each with a wound to nursewheeled and galloped on But in the act Tarleton snatched a pistol fromhis holster and let drive at our colonel wounding him in the knee sowe did not come off scathelessThis pistoling of Colonel Washington by the British commander skimmed alittle of the cream from our great and glorious victory Twas noserious hurt but wanting it I make no doubt we should have ridden downthe flying dragoons adding them and their doughty colonel to boot tothe fivehundredodd prisoners we tookThe battle fought and wontwas over and done with two full hoursbefore noonDan Morgan knew well what must befall lacking theswiftest afterdoing on our part With Greene near a hundred miles awayand my Lord Cornwallis less than three hours gallop to the southward onTurkey Creek the time was come for the hastiest welding of our littlearmy with that of the generalincommand if indeed the promptestrunning would take us to the upper fords of the Catawba beforeCornwallis should intervene and cut us offAccordingly Jennifer and I were detailed to carry the news of thevictory to Greenes camp at Cheraw Hill and when we rode away on thewarm trail of the flying British we left Dan Morgans men hard at itburning the heavy impedimenta of the capture and otherwise making readyfor the swiftest of forced marches to the northTwould be a thankless task to take you with us stage by stage on ourcrosscountry gallop to advertise General Greene of the victory at thecow pastures Suffice it to say that we made shift to turn the head ofthe advancing British main now in motion and hastening with all speedto cut Dan Morgan off that we were by turns well soaked by rain andstream deep mired in bogs chased times without number by the enemysoutriders and hardshipped freely for food and horse provender before wesaw the camp on the Pedee All this you may figure for yourselves themain point being that we came at length to the goal wearymiresplashed and belted to the last bucklehole to pinch down thehunger pains but sound of skin wind and limbHaving our news which set the camp in a pretty furor of rejoicing Ipromise you General Greene lost not an hour in making his dispositionsLeaving Isaac Huger and Colonel Otho Williams in command at Cheraw thegeneral sent Edward Stevens with the Virginians by way of Charlotte toMorgans aid and himself took horse with a handful of dragoons inwhich Dick and I were volunteers to ride post haste to a meeting withMorgan at the upper fordsAgain I may pass lightly over an interval of three days spent hardily inthe saddle coming at once to that raindrenched thirtyfirst ofJanuary cold raw and dismal when we drew rein at Sherrards Ford andfound Dan Morgan and his men safe across the Catawba with his prisonersand my Lord Cornwallis quite as safely floodchecked on the western bankof the streamHaving done our errand Dick and I reported at once to our colonelTwas of a piece with William Washingtons goodness of heart to offer usleave to restYou have had weary work of it I doubt not gentlemen he would sayYour time is your own until General Greene sets us in order for what hehas in mind to doI looked at Dick and he looked at meMay we count upon twentyfour hours think you Colonel I askedSafely I should sayThen I shall ask leave of absence for Captain Jennifer and myself tillthis time tomorrow I went on This is our home neighborhood as youknow and we have a little matter of private business which may bedespatched in a dayWill this business take you without the linesThat is as it may be sir I do not know the bounds of the outpostingThe colonel wrote us passes to come and go at will past the sentriesand I drew Dick awayWhat is it Jack he asked when we were by ourselvesTis the fulfilling of my promise to you Richard Get your horse andwe will ride togetherBut whither he queriedTo Appleby Hundredand Mistress MargeryXLVIIIHOW WE KEPT TRYST AT APPLEBY HUNDREDTwas late in the afternoon of the last day of January when we set outtogether Jennifer and I from the camp of conference at SherrardsFordThe military situation lately so critical for us had reached andpassed one of its many subclimaxes Morgans little army with itsprisoners still safe in hand was on its way northward toCharlottesville in Virginia and only the officers remained behind toconfer with General GreeneFor the others Huger and Williams were hurrying up from Cheraw to meetthe general at Salisbury and General Davidson with a regiment of NorthCarolina volunteers was set to keep the fords of the CatawbaAs for the British commanders intendings we had conflicting reportsTwo days earlier Lord Cornwallis had burned his heavy baggage atRamsours Mill and so we had assurance that the pursuit was onlydelayed But whether when he should break his camp at Forneysplantation he would go northward after Morgan and the prisoners orcross the river at some nearhand ford to chase our main none of ourscouts could tell usWe were guessing at this Richard and I as we jogged on together downthe river road and were agreed that could my Lord cross the floodedriver without loss of time his better chance would be to fall upon ourmain at Salisbury or thereabouts But as to the possibility of hiscrossing we fell apartLacking another drop of rain we are safe for fortyeight hours yetDick would say pointing to the brimming river rolling its brown floodat our right as we fared on And with two days start we shall have himburning more than his camp wagons to overtake usHave it so if you will said I to end the argument But this Iknow were Dan Morgan or General Greene or you or I in LordCornwalliss shoes the two days would not be lostJennifer laughed Leave the rest of us out Sir Hannibal Ireton andtell what you would do he said mocking meWe were at that bend in the road where Jan Howart and his Tories hadsought to waylay us in the cool gray dawn of a certain June morning whenwe were galloping this same road to keep my appointment with Sir FrancisFalconnet A huge rock makes a promontory in the stream just here and Ipointed to a waterworn cavity in it where the flood lapped in and outin gurgling eddiesYouve been sharp to take me up on my forgetting of the landmarks butthere is one Ive not forgot said I One day about the time you weregetting yourself born I was passing this way with my father and acompany of the county gentlemen Twas in the Seven Years War and theCherokees were threatening us from the other side The river was inflood as it is now and I mind my father saying that when you could seethat hole in the rock Macgowans Ford would be no more than armpitdeepSo said Richard then it behooves us to He stopped in midsentence drew rein and shifted his sword hilt to the frontWhat is it I askedFor reply he pointed me to a canoe half hidden in the bushes whereroadside and riveredge came togetherI laughed An empty pirogue Shall we charge and run it throughHist said he that canoe was afloat a minute since Mark thepaddletis dripping yetAs he spoke an Indian stood up in the bushes beside the pirogue holdingout his empty hands in token of amity We rode up and were presentlyshaking hands with our oldtime ally the CatawbaHow said he heap how Chief Harris glad wah Make think have to goto Salbury to find Captain Longknife and Captain Jennif Heap muchgladChief Harris I queried Who may he beThe Catawba drew himself up and drummed upon his breastChief Harris here he answered proudly The Great War Chief bywhich we understood he meant General Greene say all Catawba takewarpath gainst redcoat make Uncanoola headman give um new nameWahAt this we shook hands with him again well pleased that our stanch allyshould have recognition at the hands of the general Then I would ask ifhe were on the way to raise his tribesmen to fight with usBimeby no have time now big thing over yonder pointing across theriver Manitou Cornwally fool Great War Chief mebbe heyHow is that said Dick and the query elicited a bit of news to makeus prick our ears The Catawba had been in the British camp at Forneysposturing again as a Cherokee friendly to the kings side Some suddenmovement had been determined upon though what it was to be he could notlearn At the end of his own resources he had crossed the river in astolen pirogue to find and warn usWhat say you Dick I asked when we had heard the Catawba throughThe lad was holding his lip in his hand and scowling as one who pitsduty against inclinationTis our cursed luck he gloomed Then he swore it out by length andbreadth and when the air was cleared let me have what was in hismindAfter all tis like enough we should find Appleby house desertedGilbert Stair will cling to Lord Cornwalliss coatskirt as long as hecan for sheer safetys sake At all events our business must wait thecountrys weal comes first Then to the Indian If we can make thebeasts take the water will you ferry us across ChiefThe Catawba nodded and made the nod good by setting us dryshod on thefarther bank of the brown flood By the time we had the horses rubbeddown and resaddled twas twilight in the open and night dark in thewood but we were on our own ground and knew every bypath through theforestSo when we had sent the Indian back to carry news of us to GeneralDavidson at the lower ford and to advertise him of our purpose wemounted to begin a scouting jaunt keeping to the wood paths and bearingcautiously northward toward the enemys camp at Forneys plantationAt times we were close upon the British sentries with every nervestrained tense for fight or flight anon we would be making wide detoursthrough bog and fen or beneath the black network of wet branches withthe rainsoaked leaf beds under foot to make the horses treadings asnoiseless as a catsNone the less in the fullness of timetwas near about midnight as weguessed itwe had our patience well rewarded Hovering on the confinesof the camp we heard the muffled drumtap of the reveille and soonthere was the stir of an army making ready for the marchWhich way will it be north or south whispered Dick when we haddismounted to cloak the heads of the horsesWe shall know shortly said I and truly we did being wellnighenveloped and ridden down by the fringe of lighthorse deploying topioneer the way When we had sheered off to let this skirmish cloud blowby Dick struck a spark into his tinderbox to have a sight of hiscompass needleSouth and by east he announced that will mean Beatties Ford Itake itNot unless they swim horse and foot I objected Twill beMacgowans more likelyHaving this uncertainty to resolve we must hang upon the skirts of theBritish advance till we could make sure and this proved to be a mostperilous business Yet by riding abreast of the moving main we didresolve the uncertainty heard the orders passed from man to man andlater saw a small feinting detachment split off to take the road forBeatties whilst the main body held on for Macgowans all this beforewe were discovered in the gloaming of the dawn by some of TarletonsmenThen I promise you my dears it was neck or nothing with the devil totake the hindmost Away we sped toward the nearby river spurring ourwearied beasts as men who ride for life with a dozen troopers so closeupon us that when I glanced over my shoulder the foremost of the redcoatriders was having his face well bespattered with the mud from my horsesheelsTwas touch and go but happily as I have said the river was at handWe came to the high bank some hundred yards above the fording place andlacking Dicks example to shame me to the braver course I fear I shouldhave recoiled at the brink But when the lad sent his horse without themissing of a bound far out over the eddying flood I shook the reins onthe sorrels neck gave him the word and shut my eyesAfter all it was nothing worse than a cold plunge with a few pistolbullets to spatter harmlessly around us when we came up for airMoreover there were the campfires of Davidsons men on the fartherbank to encourage us and so swimming and wading by turns we got acrossin time to give the alarumAs you would guess there was a mighty stir on our side of the riverwhen we had splashed ashore and got our news well born As it turnedout General Davidsons main camp was a good halfmile back from theriver in one of the outfields of Appleby Hundred So it chanced therewere upon the spot only brave Joe Graham and his fifty riflemen todispute the passage of an armyWhat was done at Macgowans Ford in the gray of the morning of Februaryfirst 1781 has become a page in our history But I protest that notany of the chroniclers do evenhanded justice to the little band ofpatriot riflemen doing their utmost to hold a hundredtooneoutnumbering host in checkTwas a fine sight be the onlooker Whig or Tory The Guards led bythe fiery Irishman OHara took the water first the men crowdingshoulder to shoulder to brace against the sweep of the current which onthe western side of the stream was little less than a milltail forswiftness After them came the foot and horse in solid squares andalways with more to follow None the less our little handful did notblanch and when the Guards in midstream held straight across instead ofbearing to the right as the ford ran a shout went up on our side andthe fifty hastened up from the fordhead as one man to face the enemysquarelyNow it was that the brownbarreled rifles began to crack and spit fireand I do think if we had had our other two hundred and fifty out of thatback field on the manor lands we might at least have made the wadingredcoats hurry a little Indeed as it was the van of the Guards brokehere and there and we could hear OHara berating his men as only abattlemad Irishman can with blarneyings and curses intermingledHaving no firearms save our wetted pistols Jennifer and I crouched incover waiting to do what two swordsmen might when the blades lengthshould bridge the fastnarrowing distance between us and the advancinghostTwas in this little interval of forced inaction that we heard a mostfamiliar voice issuing from a clump of holly just below our covert avoice lifted now in fervent prayer and again in Scriptural anathema onthe foeLet God arise and let His inimies be scattered Let them be as thechaff upon a threshingfloorThe sharp crack of the old borderers rifle filled the momentary pauseand a British officer in a colonels uniform swayed drunkenly in hissaddle and plunged headlong in the streamLet them be as the children of Amalek before the Mighty One of Israelmake them and their princes like Oreb and Zeeb yea make all theirprinces like as Zebah and Zalmunna O my God make them like unto awheel and as the stubble before the wind like as the fire that burnethup the wood and as the flame that consumeth the mountainsCrack went the longbarreled piece again and again an officerhallooing on his floundering battalion bent to his saddle horn andslipped into the turbid floodMy gorge rose This picking off of officers has always seemed to me thesavagest of wars barbarities How Richard divined my thought andpurpose I know not but when I would have slipped down to Yeatessholly bush he laid a detaining hand on my armLet be he said tis murder if you like but all war is that Whenold Ephs turn comes they will kill him as relentlessly as he iskilling themBy this time the British vanguard was storming ashore through theshallows below the tree fringe which served as cover for Grahams menand the kings muskets silent hitherto began to roar and belch byplatoon and volley fire Jennifer craned his neck and took a swift viewof the situationBy the Lord Harry he cried tis high time Joe Graham was gettinghis lads in order for a foot race Once those fellows come ashoretheyll play hare and hounds with us to the kings taste Keep your eyeon the nags Jack It may chance us to do what two men can to cover abelated retreatWe had tethered our horses in a thicket of scrub oak where they would beout of bulletreach until the enemy gained the bank As I looked to makesure of them the sorrel gave a shrill neigh to welcome the pounding ofhoofs on the Appleby road I made sure this would be General Davidsonbringing in the reserves and so indeed it was but he came too lateOHaras men were already climbing the bank and Joe Graham was rallyinghis little company for flight in the face of an onset that made the treefringe sing with musket ballsTis our cue to run away Dick shouted dragging me to my feet Tothe horsesBut now we were too late Davidsons men were between us and the scruboak thicket and we must wait till the column swept byDick swore fervently and put his face to the foe and his back to atree Whereupon I dragged him down as promptly as he had just nowdragged me up telling him his broadsword would make but a poor shiftparrying musketballsWhat followed after was over and done with in a dozen flutteringheartbeats Seeing the case was desperate General Davidson gatheredGrahams fifty into his flying column flogged his rear into theretreat and was pitched out of his saddle by a Tory riflebullet whilsthe was doing it And when the way to our horses was clear of thegalloping Carolinians and we would have run to mount and ride afterthem the swarming redcoat van was upon usUp with you and out of this cried Jennifer setting me the exampleWe must een gallop as we can Quick manBut in the gathering and the retreat our old sharpshooter under hisholly bush had been left behind and now we heard him again chantinghis terrible imprecations on the enemyDick saw the meaning in my look and together we pounced to drag the oldman out of hiding When we burst down upon him Yeates had his piece tohis face and was drawing a bead on a stout man in cocked hat and plainregimentals whose horse was curveting and sidling in the nearershallows no less a figure in truth than my Lord Cornwallis himselfcheering his men on to the attackWe had scarce made out the old hunters target when the rifle spat firethe curveting charger reared in its death plunge and the Britishcommanderinchief unhurt as it seemed was dragged from theentanglement of his stirrups by his aidesThe old marksman sprang up in a fury of wrath Dad blast ye for a pairof aimspilinA roar of musketry cut the rebuke in half and a storm of bullets smotethrough the branches overhead A falling bough knocked my hat off and Istooped to recover it When I rose Dick was clipping the old mantightly in his arms Yeatess belt was cut and a little oozingwellspring of red was slowly soaking the fringe of his huntingshirtEase me down Capn Dick ease me down The old mans done for thistime ez I allowspang in the innards Ease me down and get off foryerselves if so be ye can immejitThe wagging jaw dropped and the keen old eyes went dim and sightlessDicks oath was more a sob than an imprecation and now it was I whosaid Come onthe living before the dead and so we made thewellnigh hopeless dash for the horsesHow we rode free out of that hurlyburly at the fordhead you mustfigure for yourselves if you can The men of the British vanguard wereall about us when we got to the scrub oak thicket and mounted but noone of them raised a hand to stay us I have thought since that mayhapthey took us for a pair of their own Tory allies who were not abovewearing the stolen uniforms of the dead Be that as it may we rode awayunhindered Dick in all the bravery of his captains slashings and Iin lighthorse buff and blue taking the road toward the manor housebecause that was the only one open to us and ambling leisurely till wewere beyond the sight and sound of the victors at the fordBut once at large we put spurs to our horses in true ritter fashionand we had galloped half way to Appleby house before Dick saidNow we are well out of that what next We can not go to Margery withthe whole British army at our heelsNay but we shall if only for a short halfhour I asserted Then asonce before I gave him my best bow For the last time it may be letme play the lord of the manor You are very welcome to my fathersdemesne Richard and to all of its holdingsAll said he giving me a quick eyeshot as we pressed on side bysideYes all said I and I meant it in good faith He should have thelady too that precious holding of the old manse without whom myfathers acres would be but a bauble to be lost or won indifferentlyThen you do not love Madge more he queried his eye kindlingNay I did not say that But I did say the other that you should havethe house and all its holdingsWe were cantering up the oaksentried avenue to that door which GilbertStair had once sought to keep against us with his bellmouthedblunderbuss There was no sign of any living thing about the place andwhen we had no answer to our swordhilt knockings on the door the ladturned upon me with a flash of anger in his eyes and his lip acurlYou knew full well what you were promising John Ireton he said Sheis not hereXLIXIN WHICH A LAWYER HATH HIS FEEWhat Richards most natural resentment would have led to in what newtangle of the net of bitterness we might have been enmeshed we werespared the knowing For when he said She is not here two happeningsintervened to give us both other things to think ofThe first was the advent at the far end of the oaklined avenue of atroop of British lighthorse trotting leisurely the second was theswinging inward of the door of unwelcome with old Anthony grinning andbowing behind itNow when you have fairly surprised a fox in the open he asks nothingmore than a hole to hide him in There were the hunters coming up theavenue and here was our dodgehole gaping before us So as huntedthings will we took earth quickly though truly twas anostrichtrick rather than a foxs since we left the horses standingwithout to advertise our presence to all and sundryIt was Richard who first found the wit to realize the ostrichplayThe horseswe may as well have left the town crier outside to ringhis bell and tell the redcoats we are here he would say and before Iknew what he would be at he had snatched the door open and was whistlingsoftly to the big grayHearing his masters call the gray pricked his ears and cameobediently with the sorrel tagging at his heels A moment later whenthe upcoming troop was hidden by a turn in the avenue we had the pairof them in the hall with the door shut and barred behind themSo far so good quoth Dick Then to the old black who had stood bysaucereyed and speechless the while Anthony do you be as big anumbskull as you were born to be and hold these redcoat gentlemen inpalaver till we can win out at the backThe old majordomo nodded his goodwill but now my slow wit came inplay Weve done it now said I The horses will go out as they camein or not at all Had you forgotten the stair at the backJudge for yourselves my dears if this were the time place or crisisfor a man to fling himself upon the hall settle grip his ribs and laughlike any lackwit Yet this is what Richard Jennifer didIt was in the very midst of his gust of illtimed merriment while thehorses were nosing niftily at their strange surroundings and thehoofstrokes of the redcoat troop could be plainly heard on the gravelof the avenue that I chanced to lift my eyes to the stair Therelooking down upon us with speechless astoundment in the bluegray eyesstood our dear ladyAnother instant and she was with us stamping her foot and crying MonDieu what is this Are you gone mad both of youDicks answer was another burst of laughter loud enough you wouldthink to be heard by those beyond the doorBehold four witless brute beasts Mistress Madgetwo horses and twoasses he said And then to old Anthony Open the door Tony andinvite the gentlemen inBut Margery was before him Ah my dears a mans wit is like amatchlock fizzing and sputtering its way noisily to find the powderwhilst the enemy hath time to ride up and saber the musketeer but awomans is like the spark in a tinderboxa quick snip of flint andsteel and you have your fire In a flash my lady had torn down the heavycurtains from an inner doorway and was carpeting a horse path for us tothe rearQuick she cried lead them gently for the love of heavenShe went before us padding the way with whatever came first to handrugs curtains tablecoverings and I know not what besides and by thetime the British troopers were hammering at the outer door we were deepwithin the old mansion and had made shift to drag the unwilling horsesby one and twostep descents to a room half under and half out ofground which served as a sort of antedungeon to the wine cellarHere I thought we might be safe for the moment but not so my ladyCalling Dick to help herin all the fierce haste of it I marked thatshe called to Dick and not to meshe unlocked and opened the door tothe wine vault and in a trice we two and the luckless horses weresafely jailed in pitchy darkness with the stout oaken door slammedbehind us the bolt shot in the lock and the key withdrawn as we couldsee by the spot of light which came through the keyholeRichard was the first to break the gravelike silence of our dungeonLord said he did ever you see such sharpwit work in all youradventures What a soldiers wife shed makeI smiled at that being safe to smile in the darkness For was she not asoldiers wife I hugged that saying as we cling to the thing that isslipping from us True I was here to give her freely over to anotherand a better soldier but while she was mine I would claim her in myheart at leastThe excitement of the narrow escape somewhat overpast we sat long onthe edge of a winebin speculating in whispers as to what would befalland listening vainly for the footsteps which would forecast our releaseor our capture by the enemy But when no sounds threatening orencouraging came from the upper world we groped about till we foundthe cellar candle lighted it with flint and steel and tinderbox andtook a survey of our jailTwas the same old cavernous wine vault of my youthful remembrance suchan one as has not its mate in all Carolina to this good day as I firmlybelieve My fathers hobby was to build for all eternity and thisstonearched cellarage was more like a cathedral crypt than a storeroomfor a country gentlemans tablestock of winesDick held the candle aloft and scanned the bottle racks none so greatlydepleted as they might have been had any hand but that closefisted oneof Gilbert Stairs taken the key in charge after my fatherThere is no lack of potables says my candlebearer but unhappilythere is never so much as a dry crust to soak in them And as for thehorses Ill venture theyd give it all pint for pint for a goodfeeding of oatsTruly said I and then we fell to stripping the straw casings fromthe bottles of madeira to give the poor beasts a feed of ryestalkswhich had grown and ripened their grain many a year before either thesorrel or the gray was foaledHaving no timemeasure save our own impatience it seemed a weary whilebefore we heard the key rasping in the lock of our prison doorTis Madge said Dick with a true lovers gift of second sight andtwas he who went to help her swing the thickslabbed oakWhat passed between them I did not hear nor want to hear But when thedoor was swung to and locked again I knew we were not free to goabroadRichard came back to me in the inner vault bearing gifts the betterpart of a boiled ham with bread to match a jug of water from the welland more candlesWe are not to starve but that is our best news thus far he saidOf all the houses on our side of the river Lord Cornwallis must needspitch upon this manor of Appleby for his rallying headquarters Madgecan not guess when he and the army will be gone and she is frightedstiff for our sakesThis was sober news indeed but we could do naught but make the best ofit As for me I was most anxious to know if the good priest were atAppleby and what of my chance for seeing him but of this I could sayno word to RichardSo when we had done full justice to my ladys bounty we stowed thehorses in the deepest of the vaults and stripped more of the bottlecoverings for them But having only the jug of water we could do nomore than swab their mouths out with a wetted kerchief in lieu of givingthem a drinkWhen all was done we sat ourselves down to wait as we must and when thesilence and solitude had wrought their perfect work we fell to talkingin low tones to match the place and circumstance and I do think inthose quiet hours walled in as we were from all the disturbments of theouter world we came closer than we had come for many monthsAnd while we sat and talked the long day wore on to evening and a stormcame on as we could determine though no otherwise than by the muffledrolling of the thunder which since we could not see the lightning norhear the rain we took at first for the booming of distant cannonI can not tell you all we spoke of in that daylong immurement Therewas some talk of the great struggle for independence now though weknew it not drawing near to its close and there was much ofreminiscence harking back to the exciting and tragic scenes in which wetwo had had our entrances and our exits Also there was a tribute paidto the memory of our true old friend and trusted comrade in armsEphraim Yeates so lately gone to his own place Twas at this time Ilearned what of the old mans gifts and peculiarities I havehereinbefore set down for Richard had known him long and wellFrom speaking of old Ephraim and his sudden takingoff we came to thingsmore nearly present and at length Dick would lay a finger gently uponthe mystery in which he was as yet walking as one blindfoldedTis not a shameful thing dont tell me it is that Jack he wouldsay and I gave him speedy assurance upon that headNotis never shameful so much I may lay an oath toYet you said oncein that black night when I went mad and would havekilled youthat your life lay between Madge and meSo it didand does And God will bear me witness dear lad that Ihave worn that life upon my sleeveNay he said very gently you need not go so high for a witnesshave I not seenWe fell silent upon that and there in the candleyellowed gloom of ourdungeon harbor I fought the fellest battle of my life fought it andwon it too my dears once and for all There was a cold sweat on mybrow when I began in low tones to tell him the story of that fatefulnight in June At rising forty tis no light thing to lose afriendnay to turn a friends love into scorn and loathing and bitterhatredHe heard me through without a word and at the end when I looked to seehim spring up and bid me draw and let him have his one poor chance forsatisfaction he still sat motionless winking and staring at theguttering candle And when he spoke twas with a quivering of the lipthat was not of angerDear God said he tis I who stand in the wayNo for she loves you Richard as dearly as she hates me And tis notso hopeless now else I had never screwed together the courage to tellyou all this She has at last consented to the Churchs undoing of theincomplete marriagetwas this she wrote me about when we were at theCowpens and twas her letter that set me upon going to Winnsborough tosee the priest I missed him there as you know but I am here now byher own appointment to meet him in her fathers houseHe shook his head slowly Youve killed the hope in me Jack I dothink you are all at sea tis you she lovesnot meI could afford to smile at thatIf you could see how she has ever gone about to prove that she did notlove me you would rest easy on that score dear ladBut he would only shake his head againTwas to save your life she rode in on us that morning under the oaksin the gladeTwas a womanly horror of a duel and bloodshed more belike said IBut she has saved your life thrice since then as you confessYes from a strained sense of wifely duty as she took good care totell meNone the lessah Jack you do not know her as I do she would neverhave consented to stand before the priest with you had there not beensomething warmer than hatred in her heartTwas a bitter necessity fairly forced upon her Tell me had therebeen a spark of love for me in her heart would she have treated me asthe dust beneath her feet on that long infaring from the westernmountains She never spoke a word to me Dick in all those weeksWhich may prove no more than that you said or did something to cut herto the quick Twould be well in your way Jack She is as sensitive asshe should be and you are blunter than Iwhich is the worst I couldsay of youNo no you are far beside the mark You forget that the breaking ofthe marriage is of her own proposingat least I should say I onlyhinted at itThere may be two sides to that as well Have you ever told her thatyou love her JackSurely not I have been all kinds of a poltroon in this matter as Ihave confessed but this one thing I have not doneWell said he speaking slowly as one who thinks the path out word byword what if she believes tis you who want your freedom What if youhave made her that bitterest thing in all the worlda woman scornedI would not listen to him moreThis is all the merest folly Richard as I will prove to you beyondthe question of a doubt Do you mind that little interval in theCherokees tortureplay when they came to bind us afresh for theburningI mind no more of that horrornight than I can helpWell in that hour when death was waiting for all three of us shewrote a little farewell note to the man she loved Twas for you Dickbut her Indian messenger blundered and gave it meHe got upon his feet at that and began to pace slowly back and forthunder the gloomy archings But ere long he paused to grasp and wring myhand most lovingly saying Who am I Jack to buy my happiness at sucha priceNay lad tis neither you nor I who should figure greatly in thematter tis our dear lady She must een have what she longs for ifyou or I or both of us should have to go above stairs and put ournecks into my Lord Cornwalliss nooseNow by heaven Jack Ireton tis you who are the true lover and thegentleman and I am naught but a selfish churl with my face in my owntrencher he burst out wringing my hand yet again Tis as you sayyet I will not be driven from this for aught you have told me to proveit otherwise Madge has yet to choose between us and she shall havethat choice fairly and squarely and knowing that you love her beforewe three go apart againI smiled and tried hard to keep the heartsoreness out of my replyAs for that my lad I have had my stirrupcup long since and havedrained it to the dregs with a wry face as an old man must when a youngman brews for him But if the priestJennifer had resumed his pacing sentry beat and at this juncture a mostsingular thing happened Though we were sealed in as I have said fromall the outer world with no crack nor cranny for a peephole a blindingflash of lightning blue and ghastly came suddenly to fill the wholecellar with its vivid glareGood Lord says Richard clapping his hands to his eyes where didthat come fromI was wholly at a loss for a moment Then I remembered that there wasor had been in my boyhood days a narrow ironbarred window in thefarther end of the wine cellar opening beneath that other window of thegreat south room where I had climbed to spy upon the conspirators on thenight of Captain John Stuarts visit to Appleby So it chanced that whenanother flash came I was looking straight over Dicks head at the placein the farther arching of the vault where the little window should beThe momentary glare showed me the low square of the window opening andframed for a flitting instant therein a face of most devilish malignitypeering in upon me with foxyfierce eyes the face to wit of GilbertStairs lawyerfactorIn a twinkling the vision was gone and in the space between the flashand the crash there was a sound as of a wooden shutter slamming inplace Dick heard the noise without knowing the cause of it being sofar beneath the window as to see nothing but the lighting of the glareWhat was that he demanded when the thunder gave him leaveTwas our trapper clapping the shutter on the window over your headsaid I He was looking in to see if we were ripe for hangingTis no time for riddles what mean youI mean that we shall have a file of redcoats down upon us as soon asever Mr Owen Pengarvin can give the alarmOho said Dick and then he pulled his sword from its scabbard and Icould see the battleveins swelling in his forehead They can hang mewhen I am too dead to cut and thrust morenot soonerI got me up and went to find the sword which I had laid aside in thehorsebaiting Twas a poor bladeone of our captures at the Cowpensand when I tried its temper it snapped in my handNever mind said I give me the broadsword scabbard and I will playit as a cudgel tis long enough and full heavy enoughHe laughed and clapped me on the shoulder swearing out his love for meas if I had said something moving You are every inch a soldier Jackyou would put heart into a worse craven than I am ever like to be Andhe loosed the iron scabbard and gave it meNow ensued a most painful time of waiting and listening for the tramp ofour takers We posted us near the door a little to the side so thatits inswing might not catch us and so bracing for the onset we waitedtill the strain of suspense grew so great that we both started likefrighted children when finally the key was thrust into the lock and thebolt shot backBut when the heavy door gave inward as at the pushing of a weak ortimid hand we saw our dear lady standing in the half gloom of theantedungeon breathless and trembling with excitementCome she panted come quicklythere is not an instant to spareThe factor has betrayed you he will be here directly with thedragoonsI cut in swiftly He has not seen Dick does he know we are both hereShe had one hand on her heart to still its tumultuous beating and theother held behind her and she could scarce speak more for her eagernessto have us out and awayNo it was you he saw and my father heard Colonel Tarleton give theorder Lieutenant Tybee is to take a file of his troopers and hangwithout grace the man he will find hiding in the wine cellar those werehis very words Oh merciful heaven will you never stirRichard gave a low whistleSo Tybee has come alive in good time to square the old account withus he would say but my wonder was greater on the other head Yourfather I gasped And he sent you to save meSurely she said Are you not once again his guest Captain IretonThen she stamped her foot and though the candlelight was of thepoorest I could see her eyes flash Will you squander the last momentin silly questions she burst out Come I sayI smiled Give me that sword you are hiding behind you and I will keepthe door whilst you spirit Dick away He is not to be in thisShe gave me the weapon though not as I made sure in any consenting tomy proposal I could have cried out in sheer joy when I found the swordto be my own good blade of proofthe ancient Ferara willed me by myfatherSharp as the crisis was I make no doubt I should have asked her thenand there how she came by the blade I had last seen when my LordCornwallis tried to break it over his knee but the march of eventssuddenly became too swift for me There was a sound of cautiousfootsteps in the inclined passage leading from the butlers pantryabove and our chance for escape that way was goneToo late said Dick and with an arm about Margery he whipped behindthe great oaken door opened back against the cellar wall whispering meto followWe were scarce in hiding with the door well drawn back to screen uswhen the cautious footsteps came slowly into the outcellar Peepingthrough the crack behind the door we saw PengarvinaloneWhat brought him there without his tale of armed men at his back no manwill ever know but since his ways were always crooked and devious Iguessed he would not wish to appear in the matter in his own properperson and yet could not deny himself a forehand peep to see if thetrap were still safe shut and secureTwas evident he was much disconcerted at finding the door open and thewine vault apparently empty At first he would start and dodge as if torun away then his rage got the better of his caution and he had one ofthose senseless cursing fits I have before told you of raving andswearing and promising all manner of fiendish recompense to MistressMargery when he should have her in his powerA little longer dwelling upon this variation of the cursingthemeravings in which Dick learned for the first time of the factorsdesign to marry my widow and the estateand I do think the lad wouldhave gone out to make him sing another tune But now the factor left offsuddenly to cock his ear and listen and afterward to come tiptoeinginto the cellar all eyes to spy and legs to run if a mouse should butsqueak at himHe was muttering to himself as he passed our hiding placeBy all the devils he must be here some gait The little jade wouldhave warned him if she had known but it is known only to the dodderingold miser and me and the girl is safe in her bedroom Happen thisdevil of an Austrian captain has drunken himself sodden ah that wouldbe a rare jestto wake with the rope around his neck If those cursedslowfooted dragoons would but come Damme Ill have that bullneckedlieutenant cashiered if his high and mighty loitering balks me in thisHe stopped before the wine cask whereon the flickering candle stood andcraned his neck to look beyond it The candle was guttering smokily andhe reached a shaking thumb and finger to pluck the dead man from thewick At that we heard him muttering againTwas a play to make the very devil envious and to have it marred bythat pig of a lieutenant No one knew me in it save the legion coloneland could we have sprung the trap fair and softly not even MistressMargery herself could have laid this swashbucklers death at my doorBut now hes gonevanished like a straw bailee and all because thatdamned understrapper of Colonel Tarletons must needs turn up his noseat a bit of sheriffs work Curse himThe candle was burning brightly now and he crept catlike around thecask to peer into the bin beyond it Just then the shutter to the littlewindow of espial fell open with a shrill creaking of its rusty hingesand a blue glare of lightning came to prick out every nook and corner ofthe cellar Being almost within a blades length of the factor I sawhim plainly saw him start back and put his hands to his face and dropdown all of a tremble on the bins edge where I had been sitting whenhe discovered meTo second the flash a prolonged drumroll of thunder dinned upon thestill air of the vault and mingled with the thunder came other flashessearing the eye and making the candle flame appear as a sickly orangehalo in the bluewhite glare What with the play of the storm artillerywe could neither see nor hear for the moment but when the candlelightcame to its own again the scene had changed as if by magic Under coverof the thunder din a squad of dragoons had come to ring the factor inwhere he sat upon the edge of the wine binSoho said my good friend Tybee with a little strident laugh tisyou I am to take out and hang is it Master Lawyer I thought mayhapyoud double on your track once too often and so it seems you have Upwith you and come alongAll in a flash Pengarvin was up and bursting out in a tremblingfrenzyfit of protestationOh tis all a mistake my good sira devils own trap II am

behind and gagged him with the loose end of the rope andTybee held the candle to light the knotting of it And so they marchedhim out with Tybee muttering between his teeth that it wasratcatchers work and no soldiers this killing of vermin andbidding his men make hasteLHOW RICHARD COVERDALES DEBT WAS PAIDFor some breathless moments after we three were left alone in theStygian darkness of the wine cellar no word was spoken The rolling ofthe thunder drum was muffled now as it were booming out the dirge ofthe man who had digged a pit and had himself fallen therein and thelightning flashes coming at longer intervals served but to intensify thegloom they lit up for the instantIt was a minced oath from Richard that first broke the spell that boundusTwas too much for Madge said he she has fainted Swing the doorand light another candleI did both as quickly as might be and we bedded her on the floorstripping our coats to soften the stone flagging for her and trying byall the means known to two unskilled soldier leeches to bring her toWater said Dick but when we had laved her face with that and withwine as well without effect we were well dismayed I do assure youFor all our efforts she lay as one dead and neither of us could becold enough to pry her lips apart to play the drenching doctor with thewineLord cried Dick the sweat standing out upon his face in great dropsthis is terrible What shall we doJeanne will know what to do I asserted We must get her out of thisand up to her chamberRichard started to his feet and stooped to gather the dear body of herin his arms But in the act he paused and straightened himself to lookfixedly at meDo you take her Jack she isshe isyour wifeNay said I drawing back You are her own true lover and could shechoose her bearerA murrain on your finickings he burst out She may die whilst we arehaggling over the right to help her Take her up quick man andbegoneBut bethink you Dick I urged if you are taken you have one chancein ten of faring as an officer and a prisoner of war For me tis aspys death as swift as they can drag me to itNow you will know my dears how much I loved these two when I couldtwist a cord of such mean fiber to bind them closer together Richardseyes flashed and his lip curledOverlook it in me if you can he said with fine scorn I had notthought upon the peril of it And with that he took her in his arms asshe had been a child to be carried and I swung the door for him Buton the threshold he gave me back my sorry little subterfuge Once moreyour forgiveness Jack I knew well you were but lying to give meprecedence Can you trust me with herAye dear lad now and ever said I and so I pushed him outAfter he was gone I made shift to lead the horses through the narrowpassage and out by a rear door giving them a friendly slap to pointthem toward the stablesThis done I went back to my immurement and I know not how long it wasthat I paced a weary sentry beat up and down the narrow limits of thewine cellar alone with such thoughts as go to make the sum of thatdespair which follows hard upon the heels of some climaxing catastropheBut I do know that as the hours dragged on leadenshod a slow fever ofimpatience came to dry the blood in my veins to make me hunger andthirst for leave to say the final word to Father Matthieu and so to beset at liberty to find the bottom of the pit into which a mocking fatehad plunged meTwas all over now My dear lad was told and he had forgiven me thepersecuting plotting factor was effaced and he could never trouble mysweet lady more Between the two I loved there stood only the shadow ofthe marriage and this the good priest would presently help me todispelAnd after that  I dared not look beyond There is a way beset withlions and any man who bears the name of man in honor may draw his swordand fix his eye upon the goal and hew his path to it joying in theconflict But there is also another way a desert trail owning no perilmore affrighting than its own dread waste and limitless monotony andwhen his eyes behold the dismal prospect and his feet have pressed thehitherward sands of this desert of despair a man may well pause to girdhis loins to cross himself and patter such a prayer for strength andfortitude as his creed hath taught himTo such a faring through all the days and nights of this grim desert ofa future these lonely hours in the wine vault were a fitting vigil as Iconceived and when I had hugged my misery close and a sort ofmonstrous selfpity had come to make a seeming virtue of the hardnecessity I was best pleased to be alone In such a frame of mind thesound of footsteps in the outcellar warning me that more company wascoming sent a wave of sullen anger to submerge me and I do think twasin me to turn my back upon a friend who should come to tell me I wasfree to go at largeSince I had led forth the good horses the great oaken door had stoodajar So I wondered why my visitor made so much ado rattling the key inthe lock Then it came to me suddenly that the noise and delay weremeant to give me timely warning and at the scent of threateningperila peril I might cope with and grapple soldierwiseI became a managain A sweep of my hat sent the sputtering candle flying from itsbarrel head to the farther corner of the vault and I dropped quicklybehind a row of empty winebutts to await what should befallHad she been a ghost Mistress Margery would scarce have startled memore when she swung the door to let me see her She was gowned in herbest there was a heightened color in her cheek her eyes were likestars Truly I do think I never saw her so beautiful as she appeared atthat moment standing under the massive arch of the doorway with hercandle held high to light the inner gloomThis way Scipio she said tripping ahead of the mulatto to point outthe madeira bin We shall give my Lord and his gentlemen the best theAppleby cellar holds to speed their parting Wherewith she stood asideto wait whilst he filled his basket with the strawcased bottlesAt this I saw why she had come Lord Cornwallis and his gentlemen wereabout to take the road and the wine was wanted for the stirrupcupTrusting my fate to no hand less loyal than her own she had comeherself with Scipio to stand betwixt me and possible discovery And herword to the serving man was also a word to me to let me know myprisonment was near an endI thought it a most generous thing in her the last of all her manywifely loyalties and I would have given much for leave to stand forthand tell her so Indeed when the mulatto had poised his basket uponhis head and vanished and she was lingering to take a last look aroundbefore she followed him I was upon the point of speakingBut whilst I hesitated I saw her start back with a little cry of terrorStanding in the arched doorway through which the mulatto had but nowpassed was a man cloaked hatted booted and spurred as for the road Ather cry he doffed his hat and My dears I shall never be able to draw for you the hideous deathmaskthis man was wearing for a face Seamed and scarred shriveled and lividin purple and crimson welts you would think a ninethonged whip of firehad scourged out every semblance of comeliness leaving only theskeleton frame on which to hang this ghastly caricature of a human faceFearing him not at all I could scarce forbear a shudder at the sight ofthis walking deathmask of the libertine Sir Francis FalconnetAnd if his face were terrifying in repose twas fair demoniac when helaughedHa he said bowing again in a mockery of politeness You aresurprised Mistress Margery you heard my Lords order and thought Iwould be by now some miles on the road to SalisburyIf you were the loyal soldier you should be sir she said drawingherself up proudly you would be at the head of your troop as hisLordship directed And then with a gesture that was most queenlyStand aside SirLibertine and let me passHis answer was another mocking laugh and he stepped within to closethe door and lock it When he turned to front her again his face was theface of a tormented devilBy God you think too lightly of me Mistress Margery Before ever thisday dawned I owed you much but like a spiteful little hellicat you mustneeds add to the score by making me a target for your wit at thesuppertable Twill cost a life to more than one of them who laughedwith you my lady but twill cost you dearer stillHe came nearer as he spoke thrusting that horrible face farther intothe circle of candlelight but she would not draw back nor flinch ahair and I marked that the hand that held the candlestick was as steadyas a rock But when he made an end she flung a quick glance over hershoulder and my heart leaped for joy For then I knew she was leaningupon meOnce more Captain Falconnet will you let me pass she saidNo he snarled adding a horrid blasphemy Twas passion in me onceand I am none so sure there was not a time when you could have cooled itinto love But now tis hatred and revenge He snapped his fingers inher face The thing theyll find here in the morningHe fell face downward at her feet and I set my heel in the small of hisback to hold him whilst I could drive the point of the Ferara betweenhis ribs But my dear lady would not have it soNo no for the love of heaven not that Monsieur John she criedand for the moment her fine courage was all swallowed up of pity and shebecame a compassionate woman pleading for a lifeBut now my blood was up You are my wife I said coldly If he had adozen lives I should take them all for that which he said to youBut not that wayoh not that way I do beseech you she beggedThink of what it will mean to youandand to me For your own sakeMonsieur JohnI took my heel from the mans backYour wish is law to me dear lady But your way is clear now you maygoShe took a step toward the doorYou will not kill him when I am gone Monsieur JohnBy the name he bears he was doubtless born a gentlemen since you wishit he shall die like oneI saw she did not take my meaning that when she was gone I should lethim have his chance to die sword in handRemember I have your promise she said turning to go The army ison the march for Salisbury and in a little while your friends will behere toThe sentence ended in a very womanly shriek of terror Watching hischance my dastard enemy had bounded to his feet to make a quick lungenot at me but at herOf course I came between to parry the murderous thrust and after thatit was life for one of us and death for the other I looked to see mylady run shrieking indeed I called to her to go but she stood fastas if her terror had frozen her and so it was her candle that lightedthe grim vault for the duelAs you will know full well I was not minded to give thisthriceaccursed fiend more than the gentlemans chance I had promised togive him But now as twice before he fought most desperately tryingby every trick of fence to come between me and the silent little figureholding the candle aloft As I have often said he was a prettyswordsman and at this crisis with life at stake and all the fury ofthe seven devils of disappointed vengeance to nerve his arm his swordplay was most masterlyYet twice in his stamping rushes I found my opening once the Feraraspoint passed his blade and but for the ringed guard of the Germanlongsword that stopped it when his parry failed the steel would havepassed through him After this he grew warier having in mind as Isupposed that other time when I had shown him that my wrist and armcould outweary his Yet his savage onset never flagged for an instantand when the light fell upon his hideous face I could see the fierceeyes glinting like a basilisks with no sign in them that my time wascome to press him homeNone the less I did press him inch by inch driving him at each newclash of the steel a little deeper into the gloom that crowded closeupon the narrow circle of candlelight He saw my objectto push him tounfamiliar ground where he might trip and stumble in the darknessandhe strove furiously to defeat it Yet he had no choice and presently Ihad him among the empty winebutts foining and parrying for his lifeand pouring out such blasphemies as would make your blood run coldHere the end came quickly Being entangled among the broached butts hehad no room to play skilfully So presently it chanced that he caughthis point in the chine of a cask and his blade snapped short at thehilt With a yelling oath hissing hot from the devils thumbbook hesnatched up the broken blade to fling and stick it javelinwise in myshoulder and then I saw the dull gleam of the candlelight on thebarrel of a pistolHad he aimed the pistol at me I trust I should still have given him hisgentlemans chance But when I saw him level the weapon at my dear lady they came in one and the same heartbeat the swordthrust thatfound his life and took it the crash of the pistolshot echoing like aclap of thunder in the close vault and pitchy darkness to draw itscurtain over allI know not how I reached her pulling the broken swordblade from myshoulder as I ran nor can I tell you how an upgushing spring ofthankfulness choked me when I found her unharmed by the bullet which hadsnuffed the candle outShe was in a most piteous state now it was all over and though Icharged it all where I supposed it should belongto the account of anatural womanly passion to cling to something in her moment ofweaknessyet the blood ran quick in my veins when she suffered me tolead her out of that dismal smoking deathpit she clinging to me thewhile so close that I could feel the warmth of her and the fluttering ofher dear heart beneath my handShe said no word nor did I till we were come above stairs We foundthe rooms on the main floor deserted by all save the blacks who wereclearing away the debris of the feast of leavetaking In the hall wecame upon old Anthony putting on the chain of the outer door Here mylady drew apart from meIs my Lord gone she askedYis Missa He say tell yo he gwine tek it mighty hawd yo no come tergib him de stiupcupAnd my fatherGone to de libry to wait fo Massa Pengarbin yis MissaShe turned away shuddering at this mention of the factor for whosecoming the master would wait long and in vain and I heard her murmurOh the horror of this night But in a moment she came back to me andwas her cool calm self againFor that I am here alive and well I thank you Captain Ireton Need Isay moreI can not tell you what was in the words to make me hot with anger as Ihad but now been hot with love But the new wound in my shoulder wasbleeding freely and I would not let her see I was hurt and if aughtwill stanch a wound tis angerYou need not say so much I retorted bowing low You have spoken nowand then of certain duties binding upon those who are knotted up everso loosely in the marriage bond I have my part in these as well asyou Mistress MargeryShe bit her lip and was upon the edge of tears I saw what I had doneand would curse the masterless tongue that must needs add its wordthongto the nights whip of scourgingsWhen she spoke again it was to say This is your own house CaptainIreton what will you doOne question first is Richard Jennifer safeHe isThen by your good leave I shall do what I came to doShe bent her head in acquiescenceYou will find thethe person whom you wish to see in your old room inthe north gable Shall I have Anthony light you upNo I can find the wayMy hand was on the stair rail when the cruel irony of it struck me likea blow She had planned the loosing of the bond in the very room wherewe had knelt to take the good fathers blessing upon itI stepped back stumbled I should say for a curious weakness had comeupon me and drew her arm in mineWe will go together if you please my lady Tis only just to me thatyou should hear what I must say to Father MatthieuAnd so dear heart she bore with me to the last and together weclimbed the stair to come into the upper corridor with the room ofdestiny at its farther endWe came as far as the door I mind it perfectly for I remember markingthat the wooden bar my father had put upon it was gone and the ironbrackets as well But whilst I was groping for the latch there came ataste of blood in my mouth and I heard my dear ladys voice as if shewere calling to me across the eternal abysses Monsieur Johnyou arehurt And then from a still remoter distance Oh FatherMatthieuDick come quickly He is dyingLIIN WHICH THE GOOD CAUSE GAINS A CONVERTWhich one of you my dears faring across the frontier of the shadowland of dreams into the no less mysterious country of the real can

the eye tomark that the web of reality has grown never an inch for all theshuttlings of the sleepingtime Whereupon fullblood consciousnessregains her sway and you sigh gladly or sorrowfully and say DearGod twas but a dream I dreamedSome such awakening came to me on a day whereof I knew not the name orits number in the calendarI was lying in bed in my old room at Appleby Hundred The armoredsoldier was glowering down upon me from his frame over the chimneypiece the great blackened clothespress loomed darkly in its cornerthe show of curious china filled the shelves where my boyhood books hadrested and there was the same faint smell of lavender in the bed linenthat oncewas it yesterday or months agohad minded me of my motherWhen I sought to move me on the pillows the dream seemed more than everdreamsure The pain of a sword wound was grinding at my shoulder and Iwas bandaged stiff as I had been that other daySo I said as you have said in like awakenings Dear Godtwas but adream and saying it would turn my head to see if Mistress Margerywere sitting where I last remembered herShe was there in very deed and truth deep in the hollow of the greatchair of Indian wickerwork and as before the soft graying of theevening sky was mirrored in her eyesI sighed and there was a catching of the breath at the bottom of itTruly the wondrous dream had had its agonies but there were alsobeatitudes to tip the scale the other way For I had dreamed thissweetfaced watcher was my wifein name at leastTwas while I looked minding not the eyeache the effort cost that sherose and came softly to the bedside She said no word but as once inthe dreamtime she laid a cool palm on my forehead Weak as I wasandsurely King David was not weaker when he wrote his bones were gone towaterthe old lovemadness of that other day came to thrill me at hertouch and I made as if I would take her hand and press it to my lipsNay sir she said with a swift return to sickroom discipline youmust not stir you have been sorely hurtAye said I I do remember twas in a duel with one FrancisFalconnet He said he would make you hisNow the soft palm was laid on my lips and I kissed it till she snatchedit awayMa foi she cried I think you are in a hopeful way to recover nowCaptain Ireton I do protest I shall go and send old Anthony to sit withyouAnthony said I he was in the dream too putting up the chain onthe hall doorAh mon Dieu she said softly as if to herself he is wanderingyet At which as if to try to help me Twas no dream you did seehim putting on the chainDid I I made sure I dreamed it But tell me another thing was it notyesterday that I met Sir Francis Falconnet under the oaks in the woodfield and got this pair of redhot pincers in my shoulderShe turned away and if I ever saw a tear there was one trembling in hereyelashesTwas three full weeks ago she said And it was not in the woodfieldtwas in the wine cellar Never tell me you do not remember IIcould neverah Mother of Sorrows that would be worse than allHere was a curious coil but I could break one strand of it at leastand so I didI remember well enough I hastened to say But being here and seeingyou there in the great chair carried me back to that other time makingall the interval stand as a dream Have I been ailingYou have been terribly near to death Monsieur John so near thatDoctor Carew has twice given you overNo said I there was no fear of that I am like that man in the oldGerman folk tale who made a compact with the Evil One selling therebyhis chance to die Death would not take me as a gift Mistress MargeryI have tried him too oftenHush she said tis an ill thing to jest about Why should you wantto dieRather ask why I should choose to live But this is beside the markYou should have let me die dear lady but since you did not we musteen make the best of itShe faced me with a smile that struggled with some deeper stirring ofthe heart I knew not whatTis a monstrous doleful alternative nestce pas And I must notlet you talk of doleful things indeed I must not let you talk atalltis Doctor Carews orderSo saying she smoothed the counterpane and straightened my pillowsand after giving me a great spoonful of some cordial that first set apleasant glow alight in me and afterward made me drowsy she took postagain in the hollow of the big chair and was so sitting when I fellasleepThis days awakening was the first of many so nearly of a piece that Ilost the count of them and sleep deep and dreamless for the betterpart stole away the hours till the memory of that inchbyinch returnto health and strength is itself like the memory of the vaguest ofdreamsBy times when I awoke it was the bluff Doctor Carew bending over me todress my wound at other times it was Margery come to tempt me with abowl of broth or some other kickshaw from the kitchen Now and again Iawoke to find Scipio or old Anthony standing watch at my bedside andoncebut that was after I was up and in my clothes and able to sit anddrowse in the great chairI opened my eyes to find that my company wasthe master of the houseHe was sitting as I had seen him sit once before behind a lightedcandle at the little table with a parchment spread out under his bonyhands He was mumbling over the written words of it when I looked butat my stirring he gave over and sat back in his chair to cross his thinlegs and match his long fingers by the ends and wink and blink at me asthough he had but now discovered that he was not aloneI give ye good even Captain Ireton he said finally rasping thegreeting out at me as it had been a curse I hope yeve slept wellI said I had and thanked him once for the wish and again for hiscoming to see me I know not how it was but if there had been rancor inmy former thoughts of him twas something abated nowYeve had a nearhand escape this time sir he said after a longishpauseOne more or less of a good many since we were last met together in thisroom Mr Stair I would sayHe muttered something to himself about the devil taking precious goodcare of his own and I laughedThat is as it may be but my being here this second time a pensioner onyour bounty is by no good will of mine I do assure you sirHe sat nodding at me as if I had said a thing to be most heartily agreedto But his spoken word belied the nodsThe ways of Providence are inscrutablesomething inscrutable CaptainIreton I make no doubt ye are sufficiently thankfu for all yourmerciesWhy as to that there may be two ways of looking at it As a soldierI may justly repine at a fate which ties me here when I should be in thefieldWell said sir brawly said tis the part of a good soldier to be aywanting to be in the thick o the fighting But now that yere a man ofsubstance Captain Ireton ye will be owing other debts to our countrythan the one ye can pay with a hantle o steelOur country did you say Mr Stair I asked feigning a surprisewhich no one knowing him could feel in very truthAnd what for no Tis the birthland of someyourself for example andthe leal land of adoption for othersyour humble servant to wit Ivetaken the solemn oath of allegiance to the Congress Id have ye toknowAt this I must needs laugh outrightHave you taken it one more time than you have forsworn it Mr StairLaugh and ye will he said quite placably ye shall never laugh thepeetriotism out o me Tis little enough an old man can do but theprecious cause o liberty will never have to ask that little twiceCaptain IretonSince he would ever be on the winning side this foreshadowed goodtidings indeed So I would ask him straight what news there wasHave they not told ye Tis braw news he chuckled Whilst ye were onyour back General Greene led Lord Cornwallis a fine dance all acrossthe provthe state I mean crooking his finger at him and sayingCome on ye ledcaptain of a tyrant king and when Im ready Ill turnand rend ye And by the same token that is juist what he did the otherday at Guilford Court HouseA victory I would askWell not precisely that maybe theyre calling it a drawn battle ButIm thinking tis Lord Cornwallis thats drawn Hes off to Wilmingtonthey say and Im fain to hope weve seen the last o him and hisreaving redcoats in these partsHis words set me in a muse I could never make out what he would be attelling me all this But he had an object welldefined and presentlyit showed its headYere the laird o the manor now Captain Ireton with none to gainsayye he went on So Ive come to give ye an account o my stewardshipI made no doubt all along yed come back to your own when yed hadyour fling wi the Old Worldies and so Ive kept tab o the poor bitland for yeOh you have said I being so far outbrazened as to be incapable ofsaying moreI have thatevery plack and bawbee Tis ten years come Michaelmassince I took over the charge o Appleby Hundred and Im ready toaccount to ye for every seasons cropwhen yell pay down the bitstewards feeTruly said I you are an honest man Mr Stair Then to humor himto the top of his bent Haphazarding a guess now would thisaccounting leave a balance in my favor or in yoursHe gave me a look like that of a costermonger weighing and measuring thegullibility of his customerOh aye Im no saying there mightnt be a bit siller coming to me afew hundred pounds more or lesssterling man sterling not Scotshe added hastily And then as if it were best to leave this nail as itwas driven he changed the subject abruptly Ive brought ye that lastwill and testament ye signed handing me the parchment No doubtyoull let it stand but when the bairns come yell want to be adding acodicil or twoLeaving the matter of the estate I thought it high time to cut to themarrow of the bigger bone So I said Let us be frank with each otherin this Mr Stair How much has your daughter told you of the matterbetween usShes a jade he rasped lapsing for a moment into his real self Buthe recovered his selfcontrol instantly Yed no expect a romantic bitlassie wi French blood in her veins to be confidencing wi her olddriedup wisp of a father now would ye Shes no tellt me everythingI daresayThen I will tell you the plain truth of it I said This marriage wasnever anything more than the form we all agreed it should be at thetime a makeshift to serve a purpose If you think I would hold yourdaughter to itHut tut man what will ye be havering about Yell never cast thepoor bit lassie off that way Ye canna if ye would her Church willhave a word to say to thatFor all his aping the manner of the ignored father I shrewdly suspectedthat he knew more about the ins and outs of our affair than he owned toNevertheless I was forced to meet him on his own groundThere is no casting off about it Mr Stair and as to the Churchthere is good ground for an appeal to Rome The marriage as it standsis little more than a formal betrothal as you well know sound enoughlegally to make Mistress Margery my heiratlaw mayhap but stilllacking everything ofHe could not wait to let me finishLacking dye say he rapped out wrathfully And whose fault isthat ye coldblooded stick Tell me this did I no bundle ye neck andheels into your own wifes bedroom And how do you thank me Im tosuppose ye quarrel wi her like the dourfaced imp o Sawtan that yeare and presently ye come raging out swearing most shamefully at a manold enough to be your fatherTwas far enough in the retrospect now so that I could smile at it YetI would not suffer him to bluster me asideIt was an ill thing for you to do none the less Mr Stair the moreas you must have known that Mistress Margerys faith was plighted toRichard Jennifer long before all this came to passDid I know it he shrilled That langlegged jackanapes of a DickieJennifer Light o love jade that she is she never cared the snap of afinger for himYou are talking far enough beside the mark now I retorted Yourdaughter loves Richard Jennifer well and truly and with thisentanglement brushed aside she will marry him when he comes back fromthe warsShe will ye say And what will become o the braw acres of Applebythat gait Id like to know But yere daft man clean daft Didnt Ispeir her giving him his quittance once for all that night when he rodeaway after they had pitten ye to bed She tellt him flat she lovedanother manAnother man I echoed Iexplain yourself if you please Mr StairWhat other manHe was at the door by this and he broke out upon me in such a blast ofcursing as I hope never to hear from the lips of such an old man againYe coldblooded crusty devil he quavered when all his breath wasspent upon the bigger malisons Has it never come intil your thicknumbskull that the poor fule lassie is sick wi love for ye yedourfaced loonAnd with that he let himself out and slammed the door behind him and Iheard him go pottering down the corridor still cursing me by all thechoice phrases he could lay tongue toLIIWHICH BRINGS US TO THE JOURNEYS ENDI may confess to you my dears that Mr Gilbert Stairs parting tiradedid not move me greatly since I would set down everything he had saidto the one accountthe misersYet when I came to second thoughts upon it this account balanced butindifferently Why should he be so eager to make me think small ofMargerys love for Richard Jennifer And why misliking me as I madesure he did should he be so hot to make the shadow marriage a thing ofsubstance From the miserfathers point of view Richard with hisgoodly heritage of Jennifer House was a match to be angled for yethere was the man in whose eye house and lands loomed largest flying intorage because I sought to put his daughter in the way of marrying themI was pondering thoughtfully on this giving the pinching old man creditfor any and every motive save that which he had so cursingly avowed towit the furthering of his daughters happiness when there came a tapat the door and Mistress Margery enteredDear heart Do they limit you to a single candle when my back isturned she said in mock pity and saying it went to light thecandles in the mantel sconcesThe sight of her standing atiptoe to touch off the candles on thechimney breast set the old lovespell at work to make my heart beatfaster What if there were a hint of truth in Gilbert Stairs wrathfulprotest What if after all she cared less for Richard and more for meDo not I pray you my dears think too hardly of the man who thus laysbare the secret thoughts of his heart for you Twas but a passing gustof the tempest of disloyalty and I was not swept wholly from mymoorings Nay when she came to sit on the hassock at my feet as sheused to do in that other halcyontime of convalescence I was myselfagain and could look upon her sweet face with eyes that saw beyond herto the camp or battlefield where my dear lad was spending himselfFor a time we sat in silence and twas she who spoke firstMy father has been with you she said I hope you did not quarrelwith himNo I denied salving my conscience with the remembering that it takestwo to make a quarrel and I had done none of the cursing He came togive me this I added handing her the willShe opened the folded parchment reading a line of it here and theresoftly to herselfBeing of sound mind doth bequeath and devise to his loving wifeMargery Ah had you been writing it you would not have written it sowould you Monsieur JohnTis but a form I would say All wives are loving in lawyersspeechShe smiled up at me so like an innocent and fearless child that for themoment I could figure her no otherwise Yet her rejoinder was a womansI say you would not have written it so is not that the truthI would not let her pin me downIf I should write it now it should be written in great letters dearlady Though it is but a form though that which followed was butanother form you have not failed in any wifely duty Mistress MargeryNot onceNo not once Three times you have done what the lovingest wife coulddo to save a husbands life and I do greatly suspect there was a fourthand earlier time Tell me little one was it not you who sent theIndian to Captain Forney to tell him a patriot spy was to be executed atdaydawn in the oak gladeShe would not answer me directTwas I who brought you to that pass she said speaking soft and lowBut for my riding down upon you one other morning in that same oakglade you would not have had Sir Francis Falconnets sword in yourshoulder And but for that sword wound nothing that followed would havefollowedSaying this she fell silent for a space and when she spoke again shewas become by some subtle transmutation my trusting little maid of thebygone halcyontimeDo you remember how you used to make a comrade of me in the old daysMonsieur John telling me things my elder brother might have told mehad I had oneI said I remembered that I was not likely to forgetAre you strong enough to stand in that elder brothers place againtonightTry me and see dear ladyNot whilst you say dear lady she pouted Twas Margery andMonsieur John a year agoneHave it as you will I will even call you Madge if it pleases youbetterNo she said that is Dicks name for me andand it is of Dick thatI would speak You love him well do you not Monsieur JohnI said I could never make her or any woman fully understand the bondthere was between usTruly There was the merest flavor of playful sarcasm in the uptilt ofthe word but it was gone when she went onBeing so good a friend to Dick then you can advise me the betterTell me if you please must I marry himwhenWhen you are free to do it I finished for her Why should you notmy dearShe was pulling the threads from the lace edging of her kerchief andwould not for a kings ransom let her eyes meet mineYou used to sayin that other timethat love should go before amarriage did you not Or do I remember badlyYou remember well I said it then and I say it again at this presentBut Dick loves you well and truly sweetheart and youShe looked up quickly with the little laugh that used to mind me ofhappy children at playAnd Inow you will read a womans heart for me Monsieur John Tellme do I love him as his mistress shouldNay surely said I gravely for somehow her laugh jarred upon mesurely that is for you to say But you have said it long sinceHave I she queried with an arch lifting of the penciled brows thatcame straight from her French mother Mayhap you overheard me say itMonsieur EavesdropperGod help me little oneso I did said IAll in a flash her laughing mood was gone and she stood before me likean accusing goddessYou told me once the past was like a dream to you you must havedreamed that part of it sir And yet you said a little while ago thatI had not failed in any wifely dutyThe time and circumstance were their own best excuse Sure I am farfrom blaming you my dear But let it pass tis enough that I know youlove him as he loves youAgain her mood changed in the twinkling of an eye She sank down uponthe hassock laughing merrilyO wise Monsieur John how well you read a womans heart Tis youshould be the lover instead of Dick He rides acourting as he wouldcharge a legion on a battlefield But nothing would ever tempt you tobe so masterful rough would it Monsieur John You would look deep intoyour sweethearts eyes and sayTell me what you would say mon amiAh my dears I hope no one of you will ever be tempted as I was temptedthen I forgot my dear lad forgot honor forgot everything save that Ihad leave to tell her how I had loved her from the first how I shouldgo on loving her to the end So for a moment I hung trembling on thebrink and then she pushed me overIs this how you would do MonsieurMonsieur Ogresit stock still andglower at the poor thing as if you were between two minds as to lovingher or eating herI bent quickly took her face between my hands and kissed hertwicethriceThat is what I should do Now that you have made me what I was notbefore are you satisfiedTwas long before she gave me a word And when she spoke it was only tosay Are you not most monstrous ashamed Monsieur JohnNo said I I am but a man and you have roused that part of me thatknows neither shame nor remorse I love you Mistress Margery do youhear I have loved you since that day in June when I came back fromdeaths door to find you sitting here to bear me companyShe locked her fingers across her knee and would not look at meBut by your own showing you should be ashamed sir she insistedWhat of the dear friend to whom you would give up even the love of yourmistressYou may flay me as you will I shall neither flinch nor go back from myword You are mine and I shall give you up to no man I know I have notyour loveshall never have it Also I know that I have gained an enemywhere once I had a loving friend Richard Jennifer may kill me if hepleasehe shall have the chance to do it but you are mine and shall bewhilst I live to claim and hold youThere was something less than anger in the bluegray eyes when she letme see them nay I could have sworn there was a flash of playfulmockery in them when she said Dear heart how masterful rough youhave grown all in a moment my Lord And then the beautiful eyesfilled and she said Poor Dick in a way to make me suffer all thetorments of that old mythking who could never quaff the water that wasever rising to his lipsAye you may love him if you must and will I gloomed God pity meI know you do love himShe looked up quickly So you have said a dozen times before Tell meMonsieur Oracle how do you know itIf I tell you you will hate me more than you do nowThat would be hard indeed she murmured Yet I would hear you sayitListen then once when we three were at the very door and thresholdof death you wrote the cry of your heart out on a bit of paper for aleavetaking and sent it to the man you loved You said Though youmust needs believe my love is pledged to your dear friend and mine tisyours and yours alone Were not these your very wordsHer yes was but the lightest whisper but I heard it and went onThat is all save this the Indian bearer of your letter blundered andgave it me instead of DickShe looked me full in the eyes and my soul went all afire Then she laidher cheek against my knee and I heard her dear voice as it had been achime of sweettoned joybellsAh Monsieur John how blind this thing called love can make us allSupposesuppose the Indian did not blunder dear lord and master ofmeEND OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MASTER OF APPLEBY This file should be named 176908txt or 176908zip This
