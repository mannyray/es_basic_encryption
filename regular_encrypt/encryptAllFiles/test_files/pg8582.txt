dissertation It is a record of several years ofvariegated vagabondizing and its object is rather to help the restingreader while away an idle hour than afflict him with metaphysics or goadhim with science Still there is information in the volume informationconcerning an interesting episode in the history of the Far West aboutwhich no books have been written by persons who were on the ground inperson and saw the happenings of the time with their own eyes I alludeto the rise growth and culmination of the silvermining fever in Nevadaa curious episode in some respects the only one of its peculiar kindthat has occurred in the land and the only one indeed that is likelyto occur in itYes take it all around there is quite a good deal of information in thebook I regret this very much but really it could not be helpedinformation appears to stew out of me naturally like the precious ottarof roses out of the otter Sometimes it has seemed to me that I wouldgive worlds if I could retain my facts but it cannot be The more I calkup the sources and the tighter I get the more I leak wisdom ThereforeI can only claim indulgence at the hands of the reader notjustificationTHE

Meadows MassacreCConcerning a Frightful Assassination that was never ConsummatedCHAPTER IMy brother had just been appointed Secretary of Nevada Territoryanoffice of such majesty that it concentrated in itself the duties anddignities of Treasurer Comptroller Secretary of State and ActingGovernor in the Governors absence  A salary of eighteen hundred dollarsa year and the title of Mr Secretary gave to the great position anair of wild and imposing grandeur  I was young and ignorant and Ienvied my brother  I coveted his distinction and his financial splendorbut particularly and especially the long strange journey he was going tomake and the curious new world he was going to explore  He was going totravel  I never had been away from home and that word travel had aseductive charm for me  Pretty soon he would be hundreds and hundreds ofmiles away on the great plains and deserts and among the mountains ofthe Far West and would see buffaloes and Indians and prairie dogs andantelopes and have all kinds of adventures and may be get hanged orscalped and have ever such a fine time and write home and tell us allabout it and be a hero  And he would see the gold mines and the silvermines and maybe go about of an afternoon when his work was done andpick up two or three pailfuls of shining slugs and nuggets of gold andsilver on the hillside  And by and by he would become very rich andreturn home by sea and be able to talk as calmly about San Francisco andthe ocean and the isthmus as if it was nothing of any consequence tohave seen those marvels face to face  What I suffered in contemplatinghis happiness pen cannot describe  And so when he offered me in coldblood the sublime position of private secretary under him it appearedto me that the heavens and the earth passed away and the firmament wasrolled together as a scroll  I had nothing more to desire  Mycontentment was completeAt the end of an hour or two I was ready for the journey  Not muchpacking up was necessary because we were going in the overland stagefrom the Missouri frontier to Nevada and passengers were only allowed asmall quantity of baggage apiece  There was no Pacific railroad in thosefine times of ten or twelve years agonot a single rail of itI only proposed to stay in Nevada three monthsI had no thought ofstaying longer than that  I meant to see all I could that was new andstrange and then hurry home to business  I little thought that I wouldnot see the end of that threemonth pleasure excursion for six or sevenuncommonly long yearsI dreamed all night about Indians deserts and silver bars and in duetime next day we took shipping at the St Louis wharf on board asteamboat bound up the Missouri RiverWe were six days going from St Louis to St Joa trip that was sodull and sleepy and eventless that it has left no more impression on mymemory than if its duration had been six minutes instead of that manydays  No record is left in my mind now concerning it but a confusedjumble of savagelooking snags which we deliberately walked over withone wheel or the other and of reefs which we butted and butted and thenretired from and climbed over in some softer place and of sandbarswhich we roosted on occasionally and rested and then got out ourcrutches and sparred overIn fact the boat might almost as well have gone to St Jo by land forshe was walking most of the time anyhowclimbing over reefs andclambering over snags patiently and laboriously all day long  Thecaptain said she was a bully boat and all she wanted was more shearand a bigger wheel  I thought she wanted a pair of stilts but I had thedeep sagacity not to say soCHAPTER IIThe first thing we did on that glad evening that landed us at St Josephwas to hunt up the stageoffice and pay a hundred and fifty dollarsapiece for tickets per overland coach to Carson City NevadaThe next morning bright and early we took a hasty breakfast andhurried to the startingplace  Then an inconvenience presented itselfwhich we had not properly appreciated before namely that one cannotmake a heavy traveling trunk stand for twentyfive pounds of baggagebecause it weighs a good deal more  But that was all we could taketwentyfive pounds each  So we had to snatch our trunks open and make aselection in a good deal of a hurry  We put our lawful twentyfivepounds apiece all in one valise and shipped the trunks back to St Louisagain  It was a sad parting for now we had no swallowtail coats andwhite kid gloves to wear at Pawnee receptions in the Rocky Mountains andno stovepipe hats nor patentleather boots nor anything else necessaryto make life calm and peaceful  We were reduced to a warfooting  Eachof us put on a rough heavy suit of clothing woolen army shirt andstogy boots included and into the valise we crowded a few whiteshirts some underclothing and such things  My brother the Secretarytook along about four pounds of United States statutes and six pounds ofUnabridged Dictionary for we did not knowpoor innocentsthat suchthings could be bought in San Francisco on one day and received in CarsonCity the next  I was armed to the teeth with a pitiful little Smith Wessons sevenshooter which carried a ball like a homoeopathic pilland it took the whole seven to make a dose for an adult  But I thoughtit was grand  It appeared to me to be a dangerous weapon  It only hadone faultyou could not hit anything with it  One of our conductorspracticed awhile on a cow with it and as long as she stood still andbehaved herself she was safe but as soon as she went to moving aboutand he got to shooting at other things she came to grief  The Secretaryhad a smallsized Colts revolver strapped around him for protectionagainst the Indians and to guard against accidents he carried ituncapped  Mr George Bemis was dismally formidable  George Bemis wasour fellowtravelerWe had never seen him before  He wore in his belt an old originalAllen revolver such as irreverent people called a pepperbox Simplydrawing the trigger back cocked and fired the pistol  As the triggercame back the hammer would begin to rise and the barrel to turn overand presently down would drop the hammer and away would speed the ballTo aim along the turning barrel and hit the thing aimed at was a featwhich was probably never done with an Allen in the world  But Georgeswas a reliable weapon nevertheless because as one of the stagedriversafterward said If she didnt get what she went after she would fetchsomething else And so she did  She went after a deuce of spades nailedagainst a tree once and fetched a mule standing about thirty yards tothe left of it  Bemis did not want the mule but the owner came out witha doublebarreled shotgun and persuaded him to buy it anyhow  It was acheerful weaponthe Allen Sometimes all its six barrels would go offat once and then there was no safe place in all the region round aboutbut behind itWe took two or three blankets for protection against frosty weather inthe mountains  In the matter of luxuries we were modestwe took nonealong but some pipes and five pounds of smoking tobacco  We had twolarge canteens to carry water in between stations on the Plains and wealso took with us a little shotbag of silver coin for daily expenses inthe way of breakfasts and dinnersBy eight oclock everything was ready and we were on the other side ofthe river  We jumped into the stage the driver cracked his whip and webowled away and left the States behind us  It was a superb summermorning and all the landscape was brilliant with sunshine  There was afreshness and breeziness too and an exhilarating sense of emancipationfrom all sorts of cares and responsibilities that almost made us feelthat the years we had spent in the close hot city toiling and slavinghad been wasted and thrown away  We were spinning along through Kansasand in the course of an hour and a half we were fairly abroad on thegreat Plains  Just here the land was rollinga grand sweep of regularelevations and depressions as far as the eye could reachlike thestately heave and swell of the oceans bosom after a storm  Andeverywhere were cornfields accenting with squares of deeper green thislimitless expanse of grassy land  But presently this sea upon dry groundwas to lose its rolling character and stretch away for seven hundredmiles as level as a floorOur coach was a great swinging and swaying stage of the most sumptuousdescriptionan imposing cradle on wheels  It was drawn by six handsomehorses and by the side of the driver sat the conductor the legitimatecaptain of the craft for it was his business to take charge and care ofthe mails baggage express matter and passengers  We three were theonly passengers this trip  We sat on the back seat inside  About allthe rest of the coach was full of mail bagsfor we had three daysdelayed mails with us  Almost touching our knees a perpendicular wallof mail matter rose up to the roof  There was a great pile of itstrapped on top of the stage and both the fore and hind boots were fullWe had twentyseven hundred pounds of it aboard the driver saidalittle for Brigham and Carson and Frisco but the heft of it for theInjuns which is powerful troublesome thout they get plenty of truck toread But as he just then got up a fearful convulsion of his countenancewhich was suggestive of a wink being swallowed by an earthquake weguessed that his remark was intended to be facetious and to mean that wewould unload the most of our mail matter somewhere on the Plains andleave it to the Indians or whosoever wanted itWe changed horses every ten miles all day long and fairly flew over thehard level road  We jumped out and stretched our legs every time thecoach stopped and so the night found us still vivacious and unfatiguedAfter supper a woman got in who lived about fifty miles further on andwe three had to take turns at sitting outside with the driver andconductor  Apparently she was not a talkative woman  She would sitthere in the gathering twilight and fasten her steadfast eyes on amosquito rooting into her arm and slowly she would raise her other handtill she had got his range and then she would launch a slap at him thatwould have jolted a cow and after that she would sit and contemplate thecorpse with tranquil satisfactionfor she never missed her mosquito shewas a dead shot at short range  She never removed a carcase but leftthem there for bait  I sat by this grim Sphynx and watched her killthirty or forty mosquitoeswatched her and waited for her to saysomething but she never did  So I finally opened the conversationmyself  I saidThe mosquitoes are pretty bad about here madamYou betWhat did I understand you to say madamYou BETThen she cheered up and faced around and saidDanged if I didnt begin to think you fellers was deef and dumb  I didbgosh  Here Ive sot and sot and sot abustn muskeeters andwonderin what was ailin ye  Fust I thot you was deef and dumb then Ithot you was sick or crazy or suthin and then by and by I begin toreckon you was a passel of sickly fools that couldnt think of nothing tosay  Wherd ye come fromThe Sphynx was a Sphynx no more  The fountains of her great deep werebroken up and she rained the nine parts of speech forty days and fortynights metaphorically speaking and buried us under a desolating delugeof trivial gossip that left not a crag or pinnacle of rejoinderprojecting above the tossing waste of dislocated grammar and decomposedpronunciationHow we suffered suffered suffered  She went on hour after hour tillI was sorry I ever opened the mosquito question and gave her a startShe never did stop again until she got to her journeys end towarddaylight and then she stirred us up as she was leaving the stage for wewere nodding by that time and saidNow you git out at Cottonwood you fellers and lay over a couple odays and Ill be along some time tonight and if I can do ye any goodby edgin in a word now and then Im right thar  Folksll tell youtIve always ben kind o offish and particlar for a gal thats raised inthe woods and I am with the ragtag and bobtail and a gal has to beif she wants to be anything but when people comes along which is myequals I reckon Im a pretty sociable heifer after allWe resolved not to lay by at CottonwoodCHAPTER IIIAbout an hour and a half before daylight we were bowling along smoothlyover the roadso smoothly that our cradle only rocked in a gentlelulling way that was gradually soothing us to sleep and dulling ourconsciousnesswhen something gave away under us  We were dimly aware ofit but indifferent to it  The coach stopped  We heard the driver andconductor talking together outside and rummaging for a lantern andswearing because they could not find itbut we had no interest inwhatever had happened and it only added to our comfort to think of thosepeople out there at work in the murky night and we snug in our nest withthe curtains drawn  But presently by the sounds there seemed to be anexamination going on and then the drivers voice saidBy George the thoroughbrace is brokeThis startled me broad awakeas an undefined sense of calamity is alwaysapt to do  I said to myself Now a thoroughbrace is probably part of ahorse and doubtless a vital part too from the dismay in the driversvoice  Leg maybeand yet how could he break his leg waltzing alongsuch a road as this  No it cant be his leg  That is impossibleunless he was reaching for the driver  Now what can be thethoroughbrace of a horse I wonder  Well whatever comes I shall notair my ignorance in this crowd anywayJust then the conductors face appeared at a lifted curtain and hislantern glared in on us and our wall of mail matter  He saidGents youll have to turn out a spell  Thoroughbrace is brokeWe climbed out into a chill drizzle and felt ever so homeless anddreary  When I found that the thing they called a thoroughbrace wasthe massive combination of belts and springs which the coach rocks itselfin I said to the driverI never saw a thoroughbrace used up like that before that I canremember  How did it happenWhy it happened by trying to make one coach carry three days mailthats how it happened said he  And right here is the very directionwhich is wrote on all the newspaperbags which was to be put out for theInjuns for to keep em quiet  Its most uncommon lucky becuz its sonation dark I should a gone by unbeknowns if that air thoroughbracehadnt brokeI knew that he was in labor with another of those winks of his though Icould not see his face because he was bent down at work and wishing hima safe delivery I turned to and helped the rest get out the mailsacksIt made a great pyramid by the roadside when it was all out  When theyhad mended the thoroughbrace we filled the two boots again but put nomail on top and only half as much inside as there was before  Theconductor bent all the seatbacks down and then filled the coach justhalf full of mailbags from end to end  We objected loudly to this forit left us no seats  But the conductor was wiser than we and said a bedwas better than seats and moreover this plan would protect histhoroughbraces  We never wanted any seats after that  The lazy bed wasinfinitely preferable  I had many an exciting day subsequently lyingon it reading the statutes and the dictionary and wondering how thecharacters would turn outThe conductor said he would send back a guard from the next station totake charge of the abandoned mailbags and we drove onIt was now just dawn and as we stretched our cramped legs full length onthe mail sacks and gazed out through the windows across the wide wastesof greensward clad in cool powdery mist to where there was an expectantlook in the eastern horizon our perfect enjoyment took the form of atranquil and contented ecstasy  The stage whirled along at a spankinggait the breeze flapping curtains and suspended coats in a mostexhilarating way the cradle swayed and swung luxuriously the patteringof the horses hoofs the cracking of the drivers whip and his Hiyiglang were music the spinning ground and the waltzing trees appearedto give us a mute hurrah as we went by and then slack up and look afterus with interest or envy or something and as we lay and smoked thepipe of peace and compared all this luxury with the years of tiresomecity life that had gone before it we felt that there was only onecomplete and satisfying happiness in the world and we had found itAfter breakfast at some station whose name I have forgotten we threeclimbed up on the seat behind the driver and let the conductor have ourbed for a nap  And by and by when the sun made me drowsy I lay down onmy face on top of the coach grasping the slender iron railing and sleptfor an hour or more  That will give one an appreciable idea of thosematchless roads  Instinct will make a sleeping man grip a fast hold ofthe railing when the stage jolts but when it only swings and sways nogrip is necessary  Overland drivers and conductors used to sit in theirplaces and sleep thirty or forty minutes at a time on good roads whilespinning along at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour  I saw them doit often  There was no danger about it a sleeping man will seize theirons in time when the coach jolts  These men were hard worked and itwas not possible for them to stay awake all the timeBy and by we passed through Marysville and over the Big Blue and LittleSandy thence about a mile and entered Nebraska  About a mile furtheron we came to the Big Sandyone hundred and eighty miles from StJosephAs the sun was going down we saw the first specimen of an animal knownfamiliarly over two thousand miles of mountain and desertfrom Kansasclear to the Pacific Oceanas the jackass rabbit He is well namedHe is just like any other rabbit except that he is from one third totwice as large has longer legs in proportion to his size and has themost preposterous ears that ever were mounted on any creature but ajackassWhen he is sitting quiet thinking about his sins or is absentminded orunapprehensive of danger his majestic ears project above himconspicuously but the breaking of a twig will scare him nearly to deathand then he tilts his ears back gently and starts for home  All you cansee then for the next minute is his long gray form stretched outstraight and streaking it through the low sagebrush head erect eyesright and ears just canted a little to the rear but showing you wherethe animal is all the time the same as if he carried a jib  Now andthen he makes a marvelous spring with his long legs high over thestunted sagebrush and scores a leap that would make a horse enviousPresently he comes down to a long graceful lope and shortly hemysteriously disappears  He has crouched behind a sagebush and willsit there and listen and tremble until you get within six feet of himwhen he will get under way again  But one must shoot at this creatureonce if he wishes to see him throw his heart into his heels and do thebest he knows how  He is frightened clear through now and he lays hislong ears down on his back straightens himself out like a yardstickevery spring he makes and scatters miles behind him with an easyindifference that is enchantingOur party made this specimen hump himself as the conductor said  Thesecretary started him with a shot from the Colt I commenced spitting athim with my weapon and all in the same instant the old Allens wholebroadside let go with a rattling crash and it is not putting it toostrong to say that the rabbit was frantic  He dropped his ears set uphis tail and left for San Francisco at a speed which can only bedescribed as a flash and a vanish  Long after he was out of sight wecould hear him whizI do not remember where we first came across sagebrush but as I havebeen speaking of it I may as well describe itThis is easily done for if the reader can imagine a gnarled andvenerable live oaktree reduced to a little shrub two feethigh with itsrough bark its foliage its twisted boughs all complete he can picturethe sagebrush exactly  Often on lazy afternoons in the mountains Ihave lain on the ground with my face under a sagebush and entertainedmyself with fancying that the gnats among its foliage were liliputianbirds and that the ants marching and countermarching about its base wereliliputian flocks and herds and myself some vast loafer from Brobdignagwaiting to catch a little citizen and eat himIt is an imposing monarch of the forest in exquisite miniature is thesagebrush  Its foliage is a grayish green and gives that tint todesert and mountain  It smells like our domestic sage and sageteamade from it taste like the sagetea which all boys are so wellacquainted with  The sagebrush is a singularly hardy plant and growsright in the midst of deep sand and among barren rocks where nothingelse in the vegetable world would try to grow except bunchgrass[Bunchgrass grows on the bleak mountainsides of Nevada andneighboring territories and offers excellent feed for stock even in thedead of winter wherever the snow is blown aside and exposes itnotwithstanding its unpromising home bunchgrass is a better and morenutritious diet for cattle and horses than almost any other hay or grassthat is knownso stockmen say]The sagebushes grow from three tosix or seven feet apart all over the mountains and deserts of the FarWest clear to the borders of California  There is not a tree of anykind in the deserts for hundreds of milesthere is no vegetation at allin a regular desert except the sagebrush and its cousin thegreasewood which is so much like the sagebrush that the differenceamounts to little  Campfires and hot suppers in the deserts would beimpossible but for the friendly sagebrush  Its trunk is as large as aboys wrist and from that up to a mans arm and its crooked branchesare half as large as its trunkall good sound hard wood very likeoakWhen a party camps the first thing to be done is to cut sagebrush andin a few minutes there is an opulent pile of it ready for use  A hole afoot wide two feet deep and two feet long is dug and sagebrushchopped up and burned in it till it is full to the brim with glowingcoals  Then the cooking begins and there is no smoke and consequentlyno swearing  Such a fire will keep all night with very littlereplenishing and it makes a very sociable campfire and one aroundwhich the most impossible reminiscences sound plausible instructive andprofoundly entertainingSagebrush is very fair fuel but as a vegetable it is a distinguishedfailure  Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and hisillegitimate child the mule  But their testimony to its nutritiousnessis worth nothing for they will eat pine knots or anthracite coal orbrass filings or lead pipe or old bottles or anything that comeshandy and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters fordinner  Mules and donkeys and camels have appetites that anything willrelieve temporarily but nothing satisfyIn Syria once at the headwaters of the Jordan a camel took charge ofmy overcoat while the tents were being pitched and examined it with acritical eye all over with as much interest as if he had an idea ofgetting one made like it and then after he was done figuring on it asan article of apparel he began to contemplate it as an article of dietHe put his foot on it and lifted one of the sleeves out with his teethand chewed and chewed at it gradually taking it in and all the whileopening and closing his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy as if he hadnever tasted anything as good as an overcoat before in his life  Thenhe smacked his lips once or twice and reached after the other sleeveNext he tried the velvet collar and smiled a smile of such contentmentthat it was plain to see that he regarded that as the daintiest thingabout an overcoat  The tails went next along with some percussion capsand cough candy and some figpaste from Constantinople  And then mynewspaper correspondence dropped out and he took a chance in thatmanuscript letters written for the home papers  But he was treading ondangerous ground now  He began to come across solid wisdom in thosedocuments that was rather weighty on his stomach and occasionally hewould take a joke that would shake him up till it loosened his teeth itwas getting to be perilous times with him but he held his grip with goodcourage and hopefully till at last he began to stumble on statementsthat not even a camel could swallow with impunity  He began to gag andgasp and his eyes to stand out and his forelegs to spread and in abouta quarter of a minute he fell over as stiff as a carpenters workbenchand died a death of indescribable agony  I went and pulled themanuscript out of his mouth and found that the sensitive creature hadchoked to death on one of the mildest and gentlest statements of factthat I ever laid before a trusting publicI was about to say when diverted from my subject that occasionally onefinds sagebushes five or six feet high and with a spread of branch andfoliage in proportion but two or two and a half feet is the usualheightCHAPTER IVAs the sun went down and the evening chill came on we made preparationfor bed  We stirred up the hard leather lettersacks and the knottycanvas bags of printed matter knotty and uneven because of projectingends and corners of magazines boxes and books  We stirred them up andredisposed them in such a way as to make our bed as level as possibleAnd we did improve it too though after all our work it had an upheavedand billowy look about it like a little piece of a stormy sea  Next wehunted up our boots from odd nooks among the mailbags where they hadsettled and put them on  Then we got down our coats vests pantaloonsand heavy woolen shirts from the armloops where they had been swingingall day and clothed ourselves in themfor there being no ladies eitherat the stations or in the coach and the weather being hot we had lookedto our comfort by stripping to our underclothing at nine oclock in themorning  All things being now ready we stowed the uneasy Dictionarywhere it would lie as quiet as possible and placed the watercanteensand pistols where we could find them in the dark  Then we smoked a finalpipe and swapped a final yarn after which we put the pipes tobaccoand bag of coin in snug holes and caves among the mailbags and thenfastened down the coach curtains all around and made the place as darkas the inside of a cow as the conductor phrased it in his picturesqueway  It was certainly as dark as any place could benothing was evendimly visible in it  And finally we rolled ourselves up likesilkworms each person in his own blanket and sank peacefully to sleepWhenever the stage stopped to change horses we would wake up and try torecollect where we wereand succeedand in a minute or two the stagewould be off again and we likewise  We began to get into country nowthreaded here and there with little streams  These had high steep bankson each side and every time we flew down one bank and scrambled up theother our party inside got mixed somewhat  First we would all be downin a pile at the forward end of the stage nearly in a sitting postureand in a second we would shoot to the other end and stand on our headsAnd we would sprawl and kick too and ward off ends and corners ofmailbags that came lumbering over us and about us and as the dust rosefrom the tumult we would all sneeze in chorus and the majority of uswould grumble and probably say some hasty thing like Take your elbowout of my ribscant you quit crowdingEvery time we avalanched from one end of the stage to the other theUnabridged Dictionary would come too and every time it came it damagedsomebody  One trip it barked the Secretarys elbow the next trip ithurt me in the stomach and the third it tilted Bemiss nose up till hecould look down his nostrilshe said  The pistols and coin soon settledto the bottom but the pipes pipestems tobacco and canteens clatteredand floundered after the Dictionary every time it made an assault on usand aided and abetted the book by spilling tobacco in our eyes and waterdown our backsStill all things considered it was a very comfortable night  It woregradually away and when at last a cold gray light was visible throughthe puckers and chinks in the curtains we yawned and stretched withsatisfaction shed our cocoons and felt that we had slept as much as wasnecessary  By and by as the sun rose up and warmed the world we pulledoff our clothes and got ready for breakfast  We were just pleasantly intime for five minutes afterward the driver sent the weird music of hisbugle winding over the grassy solitudes and presently we detected a lowhut or two in the distance  Then the rattling of the coach the clatterof our six horses hoofs and the drivers crisp commands awoke to alouder and stronger emphasis and we went sweeping down on the station atour smartest speed  It was fascinatingthat old overland stagecoachingWe jumped out in undress uniform  The driver tossed his gathered reinsout on the ground gaped and stretched complacently drew off his heavybuckskin gloves with great deliberation and insufferable dignitytakingnot the slightest notice of a dozen solicitous inquires after his healthand humbly facetious and flattering accostings and obsequious tenders ofservice from five or six hairy and halfcivilized stationkeepers andhostlers who were nimbly unhitching our steeds and bringing the freshteam out of the stablesfor in the eyes of the stagedriver of that daystationkeepers and hostlers were a sort of good enough low creaturesuseful in their place and helping to make up a world but not the kindof beings which a person of distinction could afford to concern himselfwith while on the contrary in the eyes of the stationkeeper and thehostler the stagedriver was a heroa great and shining dignitary theworlds favorite son the envy of the people the observed of thenations  When they spoke to him they received his insolent silencemeekly and as being the natural and proper conduct of so great a manwhen he opened his lips they all hung on his words with admiration henever honored a particular individual with a remark but addressed itwith a broad generality to the horses the stables the surroundingcountry and the human underlings when he discharged a facetiousinsulting personality at a hostler that hostler was happy for the daywhen he uttered his one jestold as the hills coarse profane witlessand inflicted on the same audience in the same language every time hiscoach drove up therethe varlets roared and slapped their thighs andswore it was the best thing theyd ever heard in all their lives  Andhow they would fly around when he wanted a basin of water a gourd of thesame or a light for his pipebut they would instantly insult apassenger if he so far forgot himself as to crave a favor at their handsThey could do that sort of insolence as well as the driver they copied itfromfor let it be borne in mind the overland driver had but littleless contempt for his passengers than he had for his hostlersThe hostlers and stationkeepers treated the really powerful conductor ofthe coach merely with the best of what was their idea of civility butthe driver was the only being they bowed down to and worshipped  Howadmiringly they would gaze up at him in his high seat as he glovedhimself with lingering deliberation while some happy hostler held thebunch of reins aloft and waited patiently for him to take it  And howthey would bombard him with glorifying ejaculations as he cracked hislong whip and went careering awayThe station buildings were long low huts made of sundried mudcoloredbricks laid up without mortar adobes the Spaniards call these bricksand Americans shorten it to dobies  The roofs which had no slant tothem worth speaking of were thatched and then sodded or covered with athick layer of earth and from this sprung a pretty rank growth of weedsand grass  It was the first time we had ever seen a mans front yard ontop of his house  The building consisted of barns stableroom fortwelve or fifteen horses and a hut for an eatingroom for passengersThis latter had bunks in it for the stationkeeper and a hostler or twoYou could rest your elbow on its eaves and you had to bend in order toget in at the door  In place of a window there was a square hole aboutlarge enough for a man to crawl through but this had no glass in itThere was no flooring but the ground was packed hard  There was nostove but the fireplace served all needful purposes  There were noshelves no cupboards no closets  In a corner stood an open sack offlour and nestling against its base were a couple of black and venerabletin coffeepots a tin teapot a little bag of salt and a side of baconBy the door of the stationkeepers den outside was a tin washbasinon the ground  Near it was a pail of water and a piece of yellow barsoap and from the eaves hung a hoary blue woolen shirt significantlybut this latter was the stationkeepers private towel and only twopersons in all the party might venture to use itthe stagedriver andthe conductor  The latter would not from a sense of decency the formerwould not because did not choose to encourage the advances of astationkeeper  We had towelsin the valise they might as well havebeen in Sodom and Gomorrah  We and the conductor used ourhandkerchiefs and the driver his pantaloons and sleeves  By the doorinside was fastened a small oldfashioned lookingglass frame with twolittle fragments of the original mirror lodged down in one corner of itThis arrangement afforded a pleasant doublebarreled portrait of you whenyou looked into it with one half of your head set up a couple of inchesabove the other half  From the glass frame hung the half of a comb by astringbut if I had to describe that patriarch or die I believe I wouldorder some sample coffinsIt had come down from Esau and Samson and had been accumulating hairever sincealong with certain impurities  In one corner of the roomstood three or four rifles and muskets together with horns and pouchesof ammunition  The stationmen wore pantaloons of coarse countrywovenstuff and into the seat and the inside of the legs were sewed ampleadditions of buckskin to do duty in place of leggings when the man rodehorsebackso the pants were half dull blue and half yellow andunspeakably picturesque  The pants were stuffed into the tops of highboots the heels whereof were armed with great Spanish spurs whoselittle iron clogs and chains jingled with every step  The man wore ahuge beard and mustachios an old slouch hat a blue woolen shirt nosuspenders no vest no coatin a leathern sheath in his belt a greatlong navy revolver slung on right side hammer to the front andprojecting from his boot a hornhandled bowieknife  The furniture ofthe hut was neither gorgeous nor much in the way  The rockingchairs andsofas were not present and never had been but they were represented bytwo threelegged stools a pineboard bench four feet long and two emptycandleboxes  The table was a greasy board on stilts and thetablecloth and napkins had not comeand they were not looking for themeither  A battered tin platter a knife and fork and a tin pint cupwere at each mans place and the driver had a queensware saucer thathad seen better days  Of course this duke sat at the head of the tableThere was one isolated piece of table furniture that bore about it atouching air of grandeur in misfortune  This was the caster  It wasGerman silver and crippled and rusty but it was so preposterously outof place there that it was suggestive of a tattered exiled king amongbarbarians and the majesty of its native position compelled respect evenin its degradationThere was only one cruet left and that was a stopperless flyspeckedbrokennecked thing with two inches of vinegar in it and a dozenpreserved flies with their heels up and looking sorry they had investedthereThe stationkeeper upended a disk of last weeks bread of the shape andsize of an oldtime cheese and carved some slabs from it which were asgood as Nicholson pavement and tendererHe sliced off a piece of bacon for each man but only the experienced oldhands made out to eat it for it was condemned army bacon which theUnited States would not feed to its soldiers in the forts and the stagecompany had bought it cheap for the sustenance of their passengers andemployees  We may have found this condemned army bacon further out onthe plains than the section I am locating it in but we found itthereis no gainsaying thatThen he poured for us a beverage which he called Slum gullion and itis hard to think he was not inspired when he named it  It reallypretended to be tea but there was too much dishrag and sand and oldbaconrind in it to deceive the intelligent travelerHe had no sugar and no milknot even a spoon to stir the ingredientswithWe could not eat the bread or the meat nor drink the slumgullion Andwhen I looked at that melancholy vinegarcruet I thought of the anecdotea very very old one even at that day of the traveler who sat down toa table which had nothing on it but a mackerel and a pot of mustard  Heasked the landlord if this was all  The landlord saidAll  Why thunder and lightning I should think there was mackerelenough there for sixBut I dont like mackerelOhthen help yourself to the mustardIn other days I had considered it a good a very good anecdote butthere was a dismal plausibility about it here that took all the humorout of itOur breakfast was before us but our teeth were idleI tasted and smelt and said I would take coffee I believed  Thestationboss stopped dead still and glared at me speechless  At lastwhen he came to he turned away and said as one who communes withhimself upon a matter too vast to graspCoffee  Well if that dont go clean ahead of me Im ddWe could not eat and there was no conversation among the hostlers andherdsmenwe all sat at the same board  At least there was noconversation further than a single hurried request now and then fromone employee to another  It was always in the same form and alwaysgruffly friendly  Its western freshness and novelty startled me atfirst and interested me but it presently grew monotonous and lost itscharm  It wasPass the bread you son of a skunk  No I forgetskunk was not theword it seems to me it was still stronger than that I know it was infact but it is gone from my memory apparently  However it is nomatterprobably it was too strong for print anyway  It is the landmarkin my memory which tells me where I first encountered the vigorous newvernacular of the occidental plains and mountainsWe gave up the breakfast and paid our dollar apiece and went back to ourmailbag bed in the coach and found comfort in our pipes  Right here wesuffered the first diminution of our princely state  We left our sixfine horses and took six mules in their place  But they were wildMexican fellows and a man had to stand at the head of each of them andhold him fast while the driver gloved and got himself ready  And when atlast he grasped the reins and gave the word the men sprung suddenly awayfrom the mules heads and the coach shot from the station as if it hadissued from a cannon  How the frantic animals did scamper  It was afierce and furious gallopand the gait never altered for a moment tillwe reeled off ten or twelve miles and swept up to the next collection oflittle stationhuts and stablesSo we flew along all day  At 2 PM  the belt of timber that fringes theNorth Platte and marks its windings through the vast level floor of thePlains came in sight  At 4 PM  we crossed a branch of the river andat 5 PM  we crossed the Platte itself and landed at Fort Kearneyfiftysix hours out from St JoeTHREE HUNDRED MILESNow that was stagecoaching on the great overland ten or twelve yearsago when perhaps not more than ten men in America all told expected tolive to see a railroad follow that route to the Pacific  But therailroad is there now and it pictures a thousand odd comparisons andcontrasts in my mind to read the following sketch in the New York Timesof a recent trip over almost the very ground I have been describing  Ican scarcely comprehend the new state of things     ACROSS THE CONTINENT     At 420 PM Sunday we rolled out of the station at Omaha and     started westward on our long jaunt  A couple of hours out dinner     was announcedan event to those of us who had yet to experience     what it is to eat in one of Pullmans hotels on wheels so stepping     into the car next forward of our sleeping palace we found ourselves     in the diningcar  It was a revelation to us that first dinner on     Sunday  And though we continued to dine for four days and had as     many breakfasts and suppers our whole party never ceased to admire     the perfection of the arrangements and the marvelous results     achieved  Upon tables covered with snowy linen and garnished with     services of solid silver Ethiop waiters flitting about in spotless     white placed as by magic a repast at which Delmonico himself could     have had no occasion to blush and indeed in some respects it     would be hard for that distinguished chef to match our menu for in     addition to all that ordinarily makes up a firstchop dinner had we     not our antelope steak the gormand who has not experienced this     bah what does he know of the feast of fat things our delicious     mountainbrook trout and choice fruits and berries and sauce     piquant and unpurchasable our sweetscented appetitecompelling     air of the prairies     You may depend upon it we all did justice to the good things and     as we washed them down with bumpers of sparkling Krug whilst we     sped along at the rate of thirty miles an hour agreed it was the     fastest living we had ever experienced  We beat that however two     days afterward when we made twentyseven miles in twentyseven     minutes while our Champagne glasses filled to the brim spilled not     a drop After dinner we repaired to our drawingroom car and as     it was Sabbath eve intoned some of the grand old hymnsPraise God     from whom etc Shining Shore Coronation etcthe voices of     the men singers and of the women singers blending sweetly in the     evening air while our train with its great glaring Polyphemus     eye lighting up long vistas of prairie rushed into the night and     the Wild  Then to bed in luxurious couches where we slept the     sleep of the just and only awoke the next morning Monday at eight     oclock to find ourselves at the crossing of the North Platte     three hundred miles from Omahafifteen hours and forty minutes     outCHAPTER VAnother night of alternate tranquillity and turmoil  But morning cameby and by  It was another glad awakening to fresh breezes vast expansesof level greensward bright sunlight an impressive solitude utterlywithout visible human beings or human habitations and an atmosphere ofsuch amazing magnifying properties that trees that seemed close at handwere more than three mile away  We resumed undress uniform climbedatop of the flying coach dangled our legs over the side shoutedoccasionally at our frantic mules merely to see them lay their ears backand scamper faster tied our hats on to keep our hair from blowing awayand leveled an outlook over the worldwide carpet about us for things newand strange to gaze at  Even at this day it thrills me through andthrough to think of the life the gladness and the wild sense of freedomthat used to make the blood dance in my veins on those fine overlandmorningsAlong about an hour after breakfast we saw the first prairiedogvillages the first antelope and the first wolf  If I remember rightlythis latter was the regular cayote pronounced kyote of the fartherdeserts  And if it was he was not a pretty creature or respectableeither for I got well acquainted with his race afterward and can speakwith confidence  The cayote is a long slim sick and sorrylookingskeleton with a gray wolfskin stretched over it a tolerably bushy tailthat forever sags down with a despairing expression of forsakenness andmisery a furtive and evil eye and a long sharp face with slightlylifted lip and exposed teeth  He has a general slinking expression allover  The cayote is a living breathing allegory of Want  He is alwayshungryHe is always poor out of luck and friendless  The meanest creaturesdespise him and even the fleas would desert him for a velocipede  He isso spiritless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth arepretending a threat the rest of his face is apologizing for it  And heis so homelyso scrawny and ribby and coarsehaired and pitifulWhen he sees you he lifts his lip and lets a flash of his teeth out andthen turns a little out of the course he was pursuing depresses his heada bit and strikes a long softfooted trot through the sagebrushglancing over his shoulder at you from time to time till he is aboutout of easy pistol range and then he stops and takes a deliberate surveyof you he will trot fifty yards and stop againanother fifty and stopagain and finally the gray of his gliding body blends with the gray ofthe sagebrush and he disappears  All this is when you make nodemonstration against him but if you do he develops a livelier interestin his journey and instantly electrifies his heels and puts such a dealof real estate between himself and your weapon that by the time you haveraised the hammer you see that you need a minie rifle and by the timeyou have got him in line you need a rifled cannon and by the time youhave drawn a bead on him you see well enough that nothing but anunusually longwinded streak of lightning could reach him where he isnow  But if you start a swiftfooted dog after him you will enjoy itever so muchespecially if it is a dog that has a good opinion ofhimself and has been brought up to think he knows something about speedThe cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of his andevery little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his shoulder thatwill fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and worldly ambitionand make him lay his head still lower to the ground and stretch his neckfurther to the front and pant more fiercely and stick his tail outstraighter behind and move his furious legs with a yet wilder frenzyand leave a broader and broader and higher and denser cloud of desertsand smoking behind and marking his long wake across the level plainAnd all this time the dog is only a short twenty feet behind the cayoteand to save the soul of him he cannot understand why it is that he cannotget perceptibly closer and he begins to get aggravated and it makes himmadder and madder to see how gently the cayote glides along and neverpants or sweats or ceases to smile and he grows still more and moreincensed to see how shamefully he has been taken in by an entirestranger and what an ignoble swindle that long calm softfooted trotis and next he notices that he is getting fagged and that the cayoteactually has to slacken speed a little to keep from running away fromhimand then that towndog is mad in earnest and he begins to strainand weep and swear and paw the sand higher than ever and reach for thecayote with concentrated and desperate energy  This spurt finds himsix feet behind the gliding enemy and two miles from his friends  Andthen in the instant that a wild new hope is lighting up his face thecayote turns and smiles blandly upon him once more and with a somethingabout it which seems to say Well I shall have to tear myself away fromyou bubbusiness is business and it will not do for me to be foolingalong this way all dayand forthwith there is a rushing sound and thesudden splitting of a long crack through the atmosphere and behold thatdog is solitary and alone in the midst of a vast solitudeIt makes his head swim  He stops and looks all around climbs thenearest sandmound and gazes into the distance shakes his headreflectively and then without a word he turns and jogs along back tohis train and takes up a humble position under the hindmost wagon andfeels unspeakably mean and looks ashamed and hangs his tail athalfmast for a week  And for as much as a year after that wheneverthere is a great hue and cry after a cayote that dog will merely glancein that direction without emotion and apparently observe to himselfI believe I do not wish any of the pieThe cayote lives chiefly in the most desolate and forbidding desertalong with the lizard the jackassrabbit and the raven and gets anuncertain and precarious living and earns it  He seems to subsistalmost wholly on the carcases of oxen mules and horses that have droppedout of emigrant trains and died and upon windfalls of carrion andoccasional legacies of offal bequeathed to him by white men who have beenopulent enough to have something better to butcher than condemned armybaconHe will eat anything in the world that his first cousins thedesertfrequenting tribes of Indians will and they will eat anythingthey can bite  It is a curious fact that these latter are the onlycreatures known to history who will eat nitroglycerine and ask for moreif they surviveThe cayote of the deserts beyond the Rocky Mountains has a peculiarlyhard time of it owing to the fact that his relations the Indians arejust as apt to be the first to detect a seductive scent on the desertbreeze and follow the fragrance to the late ox it emanated from as heis himself and when this occurs he has to content himself with sittingoff at a little distance watching those people strip off and dig outeverything edible and walk off with it  Then he and the waiting ravensexplore the skeleton and polish the bones  It is considered that thecayote and the obscene bird and the Indian of the desert testify theirblood kinship with each other in that they live together in the wasteplaces of the earth on terms of perfect confidence and friendship whilehating all other creature and yearning to assist at their funerals  Hedoes not mind going a hundred miles to breakfast and a hundred and fiftyto dinner because he is sure to have three or four days between mealsand he can just as well be traveling and looking at the scenery as lyingaround doing nothing and adding to the burdens of his parentsWe soon learned to recognize the sharp vicious bark of the cayote as itcame across the murky plain at night to disturb our dreams among themailsacks and remembering his forlorn aspect and his hard fortune madeshift to wish him the blessed novelty of a long days good luck and alimitless larder the morrowCHAPTER VIOur new conductor just shipped had been without sleep for twenty hoursSuch a thing was very frequent  From St Joseph Missouri toSacramento California by stagecoach was nearly nineteen hundredmiles and the trip was often made in fifteen days the cars do it infour and a half now but the time specified in the mail contracts andrequired by the schedule was eighteen or nineteen days if I rememberrightly  This was to make fair allowance for winter storms and snowsand other unavoidable causes of detention  The stage company hadeverything under strict discipline and good system  Over each twohundred and fifty miles of road they placed an agent or superintendentand invested him with great authority  His beat or jurisdiction of twohundred and fifty miles was called a division He purchased horsesmules harness and food for men and beasts and distributed these thingsamong his stage stations from time to time according to his judgment ofwhat each station needed  He erected station buildings and dug wellsHe attended to the paying of the stationkeepers hostlers drivers andblacksmiths and discharged them whenever he chose  He was a very verygreat man in his divisiona kind of Grand Mogul a Sultan of theIndies in whose presence common men were modest of speech and mannerand in the glare of whose greatness even the dazzling stagedriverdwindled to a penny dip  There were about eight of these kings alltold on the overland routeNext in rank and importance to the divisionagent came the conductorHis beat was the same length as the agentstwo hundred and fifty milesHe sat with the driver and when necessary rode that fearful distancenight and day without other rest or sleep than what he could get perchedthus on top of the flying vehicle  Think of it  He had absolute chargeof the mails express matter passengers and stage coach until hedelivered them to the next conductor and got his receipt for themConsequently he had to be a man of intelligence decision andconsiderable executive ability  He was usually a quiet pleasant manwho attended closely to his duties and was a good deal of a gentlemanIt was not absolutely necessary that the divisionagent should be agentleman and occasionally he wasnt  But he was always a general inadministrative ability and a bulldog in courage and determinationotherwise the chieftainship over the lawless underlings of the overlandservice would never in any instance have been to him anything but anequivalent for a month of insolence and distress and a bullet and acoffin at the end of it  There were about sixteen or eighteen conductorson the overland for there was a daily stage each way and a conductor onevery stageNext in real and official rank and importance after the conductor camemy delight the drivernext in real but not in apparent importanceforwe have seen that in the eyes of the common herd the driver was to theconductor as an admiral is to the captain of the flagship  The driversbeat was pretty long and his sleepingtime at the stations pretty shortsometimes and so but for the grandeur of his position his would havebeen a sorry life as well as a hard and a wearing one  We took a newdriver every day or every night for they drove backward and forward overthe same piece of road all the time and therefore we never got as wellacquainted with them as we did with the conductors and besides theywould have been above being familiar with such rubbish as passengersanyhow as a general thing  Still we were always eager to get a sightof each and every new driver as soon as the watch changed for each andevery day we were either anxious to get rid of an unpleasant one orloath to part with a driver we had learned to like and had come to besociable and friendly with  And so the first question we asked theconductor whenever we got to where we were to exchange drivers wasalways Which is him  The grammar was faulty maybe but we could notknow then that it would go into a book some day  As long as everythingwent smoothly the overland driver was well enough situated but if afellow driver got sick suddenly it made trouble for the coach must goon and so the potentate who was about to climb down and take a luxuriousrest after his long nights siege in the midst of wind and rain anddarkness had to stay where he was and do the sick mans work  Once inthe Rocky Mountains when I found a driver sound asleep on the box andthe mules going at the usual breakneck pace the conductor said nevermind him there was no danger and he was doing double dutyhad drivenseventyfive miles on one coach and was now going back over it on thiswithout rest or sleep  A hundred and fifty miles of holding back of sixvindictive mules and keeping them from climbing the trees  It soundsincredible but I remember the statement well enoughThe stationkeepers hostlers etc were low rough characters asalready described and from western Nebraska to Nevada a considerablesprinkling of them might be fairly set down as outlawsfugitives fromjustice criminals whose best security was a section of country which waswithout law and without even the pretence of it  When thedivisionagent issued an order to one of these parties he did it withthe full understanding that he might have to enforce it with a navysixshooter and so he always went fixed to make things go alongsmoothlyNow and then a divisionagent was really obliged to shoot a hostlerthrough the head to teach him some simple matter that he could havetaught him with a club if his circumstances and surroundings had beendifferent  But they were snappy able men those divisionagents andwhen they tried to teach a subordinate anything that subordinategenerally got it through his headA great portion of this vast machinerythese hundreds of men andcoaches and thousands of mules and horseswas in the hands of Mr BenHolliday  All the western half of the business was in his hands  Thisreminds me of an incident of Palestine travel which is pertinent here soI will transfer it just in the language in which I find it set down in myHoly Land notebook      No doubt everybody has heard of Ben Hollidaya man of prodigious      energy who used to send mails and passengers flying across the      continent in his overland stagecoaches like a very whirlwindtwo      thousand long miles in fifteen days and a half by the watch  But      this fragment of history is not about Ben Holliday but about a      young New York boy by the name of Jack who traveled with our small      party of pilgrims in the Holy Land and who had traveled to      California in Mr Hollidays overland coaches three years before      and had by no means forgotten it or lost his gushing admiration of      Mr H Aged nineteen  Jack was a good boya goodhearted and      always wellmeaning boy who had been reared in the city of New      York and although he was bright and knew a great many useful      things his Scriptural education had been a good deal neglectedto      such a degree indeed that all Holy Land history was fresh and new      to him and all Bible names mysteries that had never disturbed his      virgin ear      Also in our party was an elderly pilgrim who was the reverse of      Jack in that he was learned in the Scriptures and an enthusiast      concerning them  He was our encyclopedia and we were never tired      of listening to his speeches nor he of making them  He never      passed a celebrated locality from Bashan to Bethlehem without      illuminating it with an oration  One day when camped near the      ruins of Jericho he burst forth with something like this      Jack do you see that range of mountains over yonder that bounds      the Jordan valley  The mountains of Moab Jack  Think of it my      boythe actual mountains of Moabrenowned in Scripture history      We are actually standing face to face with those illustrious crags      and peaksand for all we know [dropping his voice impressively]      our eyes may be resting at this very moment upon the spot WHERE      LIES THE MYSTERIOUS GRAVE OF MOSES  Think of it Jack      Moses who  falling inflection      Moses who  Jack you ought to be ashamed of yourselfyou ought to      be ashamed of such criminal ignorance  Why Moses the great guide      soldier poet lawgiver of ancient Israel  Jack from this spot      where we stand to Egypt stretches a fearful desert three hundred      miles in extentand across that desert that wonderful man brought      the children of Israelguiding them with unfailing sagacity for      forty years over the sandy desolation and among the obstructing      rocks and hills and landed them at last safe and sound within      sight of this very spot and where we now stand they entered the      Promised Land with anthems of rejoicing  It was a wonderful      wonderful thing to do Jack  Think of it      Forty years  Only three hundred miles  Humph  Ben Holliday would      have fetched them through in thirtysix hoursThe boy meant no harm  He did not know that he had said anything thatwas wrong or irreverent  And so no one scolded him or felt offended withhimand nobody could but some ungenerous spirit incapable of excusingthe heedless blunders of a boyAt noon on the fifth day out we arrived at the Crossing of the SouthPlatte alias Julesburg alias Overland City four hundred andseventy miles from St Josephthe strangest quaintest funniestfrontier town that our untraveled eyes had ever stared at and beenastonished withCHAPTER VIIIt did seem strange enough to see a town again after what appeared to ussuch a long acquaintance with deep still almost lifeless and houselesssolitude  We tumbled out into the busy street feeling like meteoricpeople crumbled off the corner of some other world and wakened upsuddenly in this  For an hour we took as much interest in Overland Cityas if we had never seen a town before  The reason we had an hour tospare was because we had to change our stage for a less sumptuousaffair called a mudwagon and transfer our freight of mailsPresently we got under way again  We came to the shallow yellow muddySouth Platte with its low banks and its scattering flat sandbars andpigmy islandsa melancholy stream straggling through the centre of theenormous flat plain and only saved from being impossible to find withthe naked eye by its sentinel rank of scattering trees standing on eitherbank  The Platte was up they saidwhich made me wish I could see itwhen it was down if it could look any sicker and sorrier  They said itwas a dangerous stream to cross now because its quicksands were liableto swallow up horses coach and passengers if an attempt was made to fordit  But the mails had to go and we made the attempt  Once or twice inmidstream the wheels sunk into the yielding sands so threateningly thatwe half believed we had dreaded and avoided the sea all our lives to beshipwrecked in a mudwagon in the middle of a desert at last  But wedragged through and sped away toward the setting sunNext morning just before dawn when about five hundred and fifty milesfrom St Joseph our mudwagon broke down  We were to be delayed five orsix hours and therefore we took horses by invitation and joined aparty who were just starting on a buffalo hunt  It was noble sportgalloping over the plain in the dewy freshness of the morning but ourpart of the hunt ended in disaster and disgrace for a wounded buffalobull chased the passenger Bemis nearly two miles and then he forsook hishorse and took to a lone tree  He was very sullen about the matter forsome twentyfour hours but at last he began to soften little by littleand finally he saidWell it was not funny and there was no sense in those gawks makingthemselves so facetious over it  I tell you I was angry in earnest forawhile  I should have shot that long gangly lubber they called Hank ifI could have done it without crippling six or seven other peoplebut ofcourse I couldnt the old Allens so confounded comprehensive  I wishthose loafers had been up in the tree they wouldnt have wanted to laughso  If I had had a horse worth a centbut no the minute he saw thatbuffalo bull wheel on him and give a bellow he raised straight up in theair and stood on his heels  The saddle began to slip and I took himround the neck and laid close to him and began to pray  Then he camedown and stood up on the other end awhile and the bull actually stoppedpawing sand and bellowing to contemplate the inhuman spectacleThen the bull made a pass at him and uttered a bellow that soundedperfectly frightful it was so close to me and that seemed to literallyprostrate my horses reason and make a raving distracted maniac of himand I wish I may die if he didnt stand on his head for a quarter of aminute and shed tears  He was absolutely out of his mindhe was assure as truth itself and he really didnt know what he was doing  Thenthe bull came charging at us and my horse dropped down on all fours andtook a fresh startand then for the next ten minutes he would actuallythrow one handspring after another so fast that the bull began to getunsettled too and didnt know where to start inand so he stood theresneezing and shovelling dust over his back and bellowing every now andthen and thinking he had got a fifteenhundred dollar circus horse forbreakfast certain  Well I was first out on his neckthe horses notthe bullsand then underneath and next on his rump and sometimes headup and sometimes heelsbut I tell you it seemed solemn and awful to beripping and tearing and carrying on so in the presence of death as youmight say  Pretty soon the bull made a snatch for us and brought awaysome of my horses tail I suppose but do not know being pretty busy atthe time but something made him hungry for solitude and suggested tohim to get up and hunt for itAnd then you ought to have seen that spider legged old skeleton go andyou ought to have seen the bull cut out after him toohead down tongueout tail up bellowing like everything and actually mowing down theweeds and tearing up the earth and boosting up the sand like awhirlwind  By George it was a hot race  I and the saddle were back onthe rump and I had the bridle in my teeth and holding on to the pommelwith both hands  First we left the dogs behind then we passed a jackassrabbit then we overtook a cayote and were gaining on an antelope whenthe rotten girth let go and threw me about thirty yards off to the leftand as the saddle went down over the horses rump he gave it a lift withhis heels that sent it more than four hundred yards up in the air I wishI may die in a minute if he didnt  I fell at the foot of the onlysolitary tree there was in nine counties adjacent as any creature couldsee with the naked eye and the next second I had hold of the bark withfour sets of nails and my teeth and the next second after that I wasastraddle of the main limb and blaspheming my luck in a way that made mybreath smell of brimstone  I had the bull now if he did not think ofone thing  But that one thing I dreaded  I dreaded it very seriouslyThere was a possibility that the bull might not think of it but therewere greater chances that he would  I made up my mind what I would do incase he did  It was a little over forty feet to the ground from where Isat  I cautiously unwound the lariat from the pommel of my saddleYour saddle  Did you take your saddle up in the tree with youTake it up in the tree with me  Why how you talk  Of course I didntNo man could do that  It fell in the tree when it came downOhexactlyCertainly  I unwound the lariat and fastened one end of it to thelimb  It was the very best green rawhide and capable of sustainingtons  I made a slipnoose in the other end and then hung it down to seethe length  It reached down twentytwo feethalf way to the groundI then loaded every barrel of the Allen with a double charge  I feltsatisfied  I said to myself if he never thinks of that one thing that Idread all rightbut if he does all right anyhowI am fixed for himBut dont you know that the very thing a man dreads is the thing thatalways happens  Indeed it is so  I watched the bull now with anxietyanxiety which no one can conceive of who has not been in such asituation and felt that at any moment death might come  Presently athought came into the bulls eye  I knew it said Iif my nerve failsnow I am lost  Sure enough it was just as I had dreaded he started into climb the treeWhat the bullOf coursewho elseBut a bull cant climb a treeHe cant cant he  Since you know so much about it did you ever see abull tryNo  I never dreamt of such a thingWell then what is the use of your talking that way then  Because younever saw a thing done is that any reason why it cant be doneWell all rightgo on  What did you doThe bull started up and got along well for about ten feet then slippedand slid back  I breathed easier  He tried it againgot up a littlehigherslipped again  But he came at it once more and this time he wascareful  He got gradually higher and higher and my spirits went downmore and more  Up he camean inch at a timewith his eyes hot and histongue hanging out  Higher and higherhitched his foot over the stumpof a limb and looked up as much as to say You are my meat friendUp againhigher and higher and getting more excited the closer he gotHe was within ten feet of me  I took a long breathand then said IIt is now or never  I had the coil of the lariat all ready I paid itout slowly till it hung right over his head all of a sudden I let go ofthe slack and the slipnoose fell fairly round his neck  Quicker thanlightning I out with the Allen and let him have it in the face  It wasan awful roar and must have scared the bull out of his senses  When thesmoke cleared away there he was dangling in the air twenty foot fromthe ground and going out of one convulsion into another faster than youcould count  I didnt stop to count anyhowI shinned down the tree andshot for homeBemis is all that true just as you have stated itI wish I may rot in my tracks and die the death of a dog if it isntWell we cant refuse to believe it and we dont  But if there weresome proofsProofs  Did I bring back my lariatNoDid I bring back my horseNoDid you ever see the bull againNoWell then what more do you want  I never saw anybody as particular asyou are about a little thing like thatI made up my mind that if this man was not a liar he only missed it bythe skin of his teeth  This episode reminds me of an incident of mybrief sojourn in Siam years afterward  The European citizens of a townin the neighborhood of Bangkok had a prodigy among them by the name ofEckert an Englishmana person famous for the number ingenuity andimposing magnitude of his lies  They were always repeating his mostcelebrated falsehoods and always trying to draw him out beforestrangers but they seldom succeeded  Twice he was invited to the housewhere I was visiting but nothing could seduce him into a specimen lieOne day a planter named Bascom an influential man and a proud andsometimes irascible one invited me to ride over with him and call onEckert  As we jogged along said heNow do you know where the fault lies  It lies in putting Eckert on hisguard  The minute the boys go to pumping at Eckert he knows perfectlywell what they are after and of course he shuts up his shell  Anybodymight know he would  But when we get there we must play him finer thanthat  Let him shape the conversation to suit himselflet him drop it orchange it whenever he wants to  Let him see that nobody is trying todraw him out  Just let him have his own way  He will soon forgethimself and begin to grind out lies like a mill  Dont get impatientjust keep quiet and let me play him  I will make him lie  It does seemto me that the boys must be blind to overlook such an obvious and simpletrick as thatEckert received us heartilya pleasantspoken gentlemannered creatureWe sat in the veranda an hour sipping English ale and talking about theking and the sacred white elephant the Sleeping Idol and all manner ofthings and I noticed that my comrade never led the conversation himselfor shaped it but simply followed Eckerts lead and betrayed nosolicitude and no anxiety about anything  The effect was shortlyperceptible  Eckert began to grow communicative he grew more and moreat his ease and more and more talkative and sociable  Another hourpassed in the same way and then all of a sudden Eckert saidOh by the way  I came near forgetting  I have got a thing here toastonish you  Such a thing as neither you nor any other man ever heardofIve got a cat that will eat cocoanut  Common green cocoanutandnot only eat the meat but drink the milk  It is soIll swear to itA quick glance from Bascoma glance that I understoodthenWhy bless my soul I never heard of such a thing  Man it isimpossibleI knew you would say it  Ill fetch the catHe went in the house  Bascom saidTherewhat did I tell you  Now that is the way to handle Eckert  Yousee I have petted him along patiently and put his suspicions to sleepI am glad we came  You tell the boys about it when you go back  Cat eata cocoanutoh my  Now that is just his way exactlyhe will tell theabsurdest lie and trust to luck to get out of it againCat eat a cocoanutthe innocent foolEckert approached with his cat sure enoughBascom smiled  Said heIll hold the catyou bring a cocoanutEckert split one open and chopped up some pieces  Bascom smuggled awink to me and proffered a slice of the fruit to puss  She snatched itswallowed it ravenously and asked for moreWe rode our two miles in silence and wide apart  At least I was silentthough Bascom cuffed his horse and cursed him a good dealnotwithstanding the horse was behaving well enough  When I branched offhomeward Bascom saidKeep the horse till morning  Andyou need not speak of thisfoolishness to the boysCHAPTER VIIIIn a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our necks andwatching for the ponyriderthe fleet messenger who sped across thecontinent from St Joe to Sacramento carrying letters nineteen hundredmiles in eight days  Think of that for perishable horse and human fleshand blood to do  The ponyrider was usually a little bit of a manbrimful of spirit and endurance  No matter what time of the day or nighthis watch came on and no matter whether it was winter or summerraining snowing hailing or sleeting or whether his beat was a levelstraight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices orwhether it led through peaceful regions or regions that swarmed withhostile Indians he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and beoff like the wind  There was no idlingtime for a ponyrider on dutyHe rode fifty miles without stopping by daylight moonlight starlightor through the blackness of darknessjust as it happened  He rode asplendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like agentleman kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles and then as hecame crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a freshimpatient steed the transfer of rider and mailbag was made in thetwinkling of an eye and away flew the eager pair and were out of sightbefore the spectator could get hardly the ghost of a look  Both riderand horse went flying light The riders dress was thin and fittedclose he wore a roundabout and a skullcap and tucked hispantaloons into his boottops like a racerider  He carried no armshecarried nothing that was not absolutely necessary for even the postageon his literary freight was worth five dollars a letterHe got but little frivolous correspondence to carryhis bag had businessletters in it mostly  His horse was stripped of all unnecessary weighttoo  He wore a little wafer of a racingsaddle and no visible blanketHe wore light shoes or none at all  The little flat mailpocketsstrapped under the riders thighs would each hold about the bulk of achilds primer  They held many and many an important business chapterand newspaper letter but these were written on paper as airy and thin asgoldleaf nearly and thus bulk and weight were economized  Thestagecoach traveled about a hundred to a hundred and twentyfive milesa day twentyfour hours the ponyrider about two hundred and fiftyThere were about eighty ponyriders in the saddle all the time night andday stretching in a long scattering procession from Missouri toCalifornia forty flying eastward and forty toward the west and amongthem making four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring livelihood andsee a deal of scenery every single day in the yearWe had had a consuming desire from the beginning to see a ponyriderbut somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us managed tostreak by in the night and so we heard only a whiz and a hail and theswift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out ofthe windows  But now we were expecting one along every moment and wouldsee him in broad daylight  Presently the driver exclaimsHERE HE COMESEvery neck is stretched further and every eye strained wider  Awayacross the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appearsagainst the sky and it is plain that it moves  Well I should think soIn a second or two it becomes a horse and rider rising and fallingrising and fallingsweeping toward us nearer and nearergrowing moreand more distinct more and more sharply definednearer and stillnearer and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the earanotherinstant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck a wave of the ridershand but no reply and man and horse burst past our excited faces andgo winging away like a belated fragment of a stormSo sudden is it all and so like a flash of unreal fancy that but forthe flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mailsack afterthe vision had flashed by and disappeared we might have doubted whetherwe had seen any actual horse and man at all maybeWe rattled through Scotts Bluffs Pass by and by  It was along heresomewhere that we first came across genuine and unmistakable alkali waterin the road and we cordially hailed it as a firstclass curiosity and athing to be mentioned with eclat in letters to the ignorant at homeThis water gave the road a soapy appearance and in many places theground looked as if it had been whitewashed  I think the strange alkaliwater excited us as much as any wonder we had come upon yet and I knowwe felt very complacent and conceited and better satisfied with lifeafter we had added it to our list of things which we had seen and someother people had not  In a small way we were the same sort of simpletonsas those who climb unnecessarily the perilous peaks of Mont Blanc and theMatterhorn and derive no pleasure from it except the reflection that itisnt a common experience  But once in a while one of those partiestrips and comes darting down the long mountaincrags in a sittingposture making the crusted snow smoke behind him flitting from bench tobench and from terrace to terrace jarring the earth where he strikesand still glancing and flitting on again sticking an iceberg intohimself every now and then and tearing his clothes snatching at thingsto save himself taking hold of trees and fetching them along with himroots and all starting little rocks now and then then big bouldersthen acres of ice and snow and patches of forest gathering and stillgathering as he goes adding and still adding to his massed and sweepinggrandeur as he nears a three thousandfoot precipice till at last hewaves his hat magnificently and rides into eternity on the back of araging and tossing avalancheThis is all very fine but let us not be carried away by excitement butask calmly how does this person feel about it in his cooler moments nextday with six or seven thousand feet of snow and stuff on top of himWe crossed the sand hills near the scene of the Indian mail robbery andmassacre of 1856 wherein the driver and conductor perished and also allthe passengers but one it was supposed but this must have been amistake for at different times afterward on the Pacific coast I waspersonally acquainted with a hundred and thirtythree or four people whowere wounded during that massacre and barely escaped with their livesThere was no doubt of the truth of itI had it from their own lips  Oneof these parties told me that he kept coming across arrowheads in hissystem for nearly seven years after the massacre and another of themtold me that he was struck so literally full of arrows that after theIndians were gone and he could raise up and examine himself he could notrestrain his tears for his clothes were completely ruinedThe most trustworthy tradition avers however that only one man aperson named Babbitt survived the massacre and he was desperatelywounded  He dragged himself on his hands and knee for one leg wasbroken to a station several miles away  He did it during portions oftwo nights lying concealed one day and part of another and for morethan forty hours suffering unimaginable anguish from hunger thirst andbodily pain  The Indians robbed the coach of everything it containedincluding quite an amount of treasureCHAPTER IXWe passed Fort Laramie in the night and on the seventh morning out wefound ourselves in the Black Hills with Laramie Peak at our elbowapparently looming vast and solitarya deep dark rich indigo blue inhue so portentously did the old colossus frown under his beetling browsof stormcloud  He was thirty or forty miles away in reality but heonly seemed removed a little beyond the low ridge at our right  Webreakfasted at HorseShoe Station six hundred and seventysix miles outfrom St Joseph  We had now reached a hostile Indian country and duringthe afternoon we passed Laparelle Station and enjoyed great discomfortall the time we were in the neighborhood being aware that many of thetrees we dashed by at arms length concealed a lurking Indian or twoDuring the preceding night an ambushed savage had sent a bullet throughthe ponyriders jacket but he had ridden on just the same becauseponyriders were not allowed to stop and inquire into such things exceptwhen killed  As long as they had life enough left in them they had tostick to the horse and ride even if the Indians had been waiting forthem a week and were entirely out of patience  About two hours and ahalf before we arrived at Laparelle Station the keeper in charge of ithad fired four times at an Indian but he said with an injured air thatthe Indian had skipped around sos to spile everythingand ammunitionsblamed skurse too The most natural inference conveyed by his manner ofspeaking was that in skipping around the Indian had taken an unfairadvantageThe coach we were in had a neat hole through its fronta reminiscence ofits last trip through this region  The bullet that made it wounded thedriver slightly but he did not mind it much  He said the place to keepa man huffy was down on the Southern Overland among the Apachesbefore the company moved the stage line up on the northern route  Hesaid the Apaches used to annoy him all the time down there and that hecame as near as anything to starving to death in the midst of abundancebecause they kept him so leaky with bullet holes that he couldnt holdhis vittlesThis persons statement were not generally believedWe shut the blinds down very tightly that first night in the hostileIndian country and lay on our arms  We slept on them some but most ofthe time we only lay on them  We did not talk much but kept quiet andlistened  It was an inkyblack night and occasionally rainy  We wereamong woods and rocks hills and gorgesso shut in in fact that whenwe peeped through a chink in a curtain we could discern nothing  Thedriver and conductor on top were still too or only spoke at longintervals in low tones as is the way of men in the midst of invisibledangers  We listened to raindrops pattering on the roof and thegrinding of the wheels through the muddy gravel and the low wailing ofthe wind and all the time we had that absurd sense upon us inseparablefrom travel at night in a closecurtained vehicle the sense of remainingperfectly still in one place notwithstanding the jolting and swaying ofthe vehicle the trampling of the horses and the grinding of the wheelsWe listened a long time with intent faculties and bated breath everytime one of us would relax and draw a long sigh of relief and start tosay something a comrade would be sure to utter a sudden Hark andinstantly the experimenter was rigid and listening again  So thetiresome minutes and decades of minutes dragged away until at last ourtense forms filmed over with a dulled consciousness and we slept if onemight call such a condition by so strong a namefor it was a sleep setwith a hairtrigger  It was a sleep seething and teeming with a weirdand distressful confusion of shreds and fagends of dreamsa sleep thatwas a chaos  Presently dreams and sleep and the sullen hush of thenight were startled by a ringing report and cloven by such a long wildagonizing shriek  Then we heardten steps from the stageHelp  help  help [It was our drivers voice]Kill him  Kill him like a dogIm being murdered  Will no man lend me a pistolLook out head him off head him off[Two pistol shots a confusion of voices and the trampling of many feetas if a crowd were closing and surging together around some objectseveral heavy dull blows as with a club a voice that said appealinglyDont gentlemen please dontIm a dead man Then a fainter groanand another blow and away sped the stage into the darkness and left thegrisly mystery behind us]What a startle it was  Eight seconds would amply cover the time itoccupiedmaybe even five would do it  We only had time to plunge at acurtain and unbuckle and unbutton part of it in an awkward and hinderingflurry when our whip cracked sharply overhead and we went rumbling andthundering away down a mountain gradeWe fed on that mystery the rest of the nightwhat was left of it for itwas waning fast  It had to remain a present mystery for all we couldget from the conductor in answer to our hails was something that soundedthrough the clatter of the wheels like Tell you in the morningSo we lit our pipes and opened the corner of a curtain for a chimney andlay there in the dark listening to each others story of how he firstfelt and how many thousand Indians he first thought had hurled themselvesupon us and what his remembrance of the subsequent sounds was and theorder of their occurrence  And we theorized too but there was never atheory that would account for our drivers voice being out there nor yetaccount for his Indian murderers talking such good English if they wereIndiansSo we chatted and smoked the rest of the night comfortably away ourboding anxiety being somehow marvelously dissipated by the real presenceof something to be anxious aboutWe never did get much satisfaction about that dark occurrence  All thatwe could make out of the odds and ends of the information we gathered inthe morning was that the disturbance occurred at a station that wechanged drivers there and that the driver that got off there had beentalking roughly about some of the outlaws that infested the region forthere wasnt a man around there but had a price on his head and didntdare show himself in the settlements the conductor said he had talkedroughly about these characters and ought to have drove up there withhis pistol cocked and ready on the seat alongside of him and begunbusiness himself because any softy would know they would be laying forhimThat was all we could gather and we could see that neither the conductornor the new driver were much concerned about the matter  They plainlyhad little respect for a man who would deliver offensive opinions ofpeople and then be so simple as to come into their presence unprepared toback his judgment as they pleasantly phrased the killing of anyfellowbeing who did not like said opinions  And likewise they plainlyhad a contempt for the mans poor discretion in venturing to rouse thewrath of such utterly reckless wild beasts as those outlawsand theconductor addedI tell you its as much as Slade himself want to doThis remark created an entire revolution in my curiosity  I carednothing now about the Indians and even lost interest in the murdereddriver  There was such magic in that name SLADE  Day or night now Istood always ready to drop any subject in hand to listen to somethingnew about Slade and his ghastly exploits  Even before we got to OverlandCity we had begun to hear about Slade and his division for he was adivisionagent on the Overland and from the hour we had left OverlandCity we had heard drivers and conductors talk about only three thingsCaliforny the Nevada silver mines and this desperado Slade  And adeal the most of the talk was about Slade  We had gradually come to havea realizing sense of the fact that Slade was a man whose heart and handsand soul were steeped in the blood of offenders against his dignity aman who awfully avenged all injuries affront insults or slights ofwhatever kindon the spot if he could years afterward if lack ofearlier opportunity compelled it a man whose hate tortured him day andnight till vengeance appeased itand not an ordinary vengeance eitherbut his enemys absolute deathnothing less a man whose face wouldlight up with a terrible joy when he surprised a foe and had him at adisadvantage  A high and efficient servant of the Overland an outlawamong outlaws and yet their relentless scourge Slade was at once themost bloody the most dangerous and the most valuable citizen thatinhabited the savage fastnesses of the mountainsCHAPTER XReally and truly two thirds of the talk of drivers and conductors hadbeen about this man Slade ever since the day before we reachedJulesburg  In order that the eastern reader may have a clear conceptionof what a Rocky Mountain desperado is in his highest state ofdevelopment I will reduce all this mass of overland gossip to onestraightforward narrative and present it in the following shapeSlade was born in Illinois of good parentage  At about twentysix yearsof age he killed a man in a quarrel and fled the country  At St JosephMissouri he joined one of the early Californiabound emigrant trainsand was given the post of trainmaster  One day on the plains he had anangry dispute with one of his wagondrivers and both drew theirrevolvers  But the driver was the quicker artist and had his weaponcocked first  So Slade said it was a pity to waste life on so small amatter and proposed that the pistols be thrown on the ground and thequarrel settled by a fistfight  The unsuspecting driver agreed andthrew down his pistolwhereupon Slade laughed at his simplicity andshot him deadHe made his escape and lived a wild life for awhile dividing his timebetween fighting Indians and avoiding an Illinois sheriff who had beensent to arrest him for his first murder  It is said that in one Indianbattle he killed three savages with his own hand and afterward cut theirears off and sent them with his compliments to the chief of the tribeSlade soon gained a name for fearless resolution and this was sufficientmerit to procure for him the important post of overland divisionagent atJulesburg in place of Mr Jules removed  For some time previously thecompanys horses had been frequently stolen and the coaches delayed bygangs of outlaws who were wont to laugh at the idea of any mans havingthe temerity to resent such outrages  Slade resented them promptlyThe outlaws soon found that the new agent was a man who did not fearanything that breathed the breath of life  He made short work of alloffenders  The result was that delays ceased the companys property waslet alone and no matter what happened or who suffered Slades coacheswent through every time  True in order to bring about this wholesomechange Slade had to kill several mensome say three others say fourand others sixbut the world was the richer for their loss  The firstprominent difficulty he had was with the exagent Jules who bore thereputation of being a reckless and desperate man himself  Jules hatedSlade for supplanting him and a good fair occasion for a fight was allhe was waiting for  By and by Slade dared to employ a man whom Jules hadonce discharged  Next Slade seized a team of stagehorses which heaccused Jules of having driven off and hidden somewhere for his own useWar was declared and for a day or two the two men walked warily aboutthe streets seeking each other Jules armed with a doublebarreled shotgun and Slade with his historycreating revolver  Finally as Sladestepped into a store Jules poured the contents of his gun into him frombehind the door  Slade was plucky and Jules got several bad pistolwounds in returnThen both men fell and were carried to their respective lodgings bothswearing that better aim should do deadlier work next time  Both werebedridden a long time but Jules got to his feet first and gathering hispossessions together packed them on a couple of mules and fled to theRocky Mountains to gather strength in safety against the day ofreckoning  For many months he was not seen or heard of and wasgradually dropped out of the remembrance of all save Slade himself  ButSlade was not the man to forget him  On the contrary common report saidthat Slade kept a reward standing for his capture dead or aliveAfter awhile seeing that Slades energetic administration had restoredpeace and order to one of the worst divisions of the road the overlandstage company transferred him to the Rocky Ridge division in the RockyMountains to see if he could perform a like miracle there  It was thevery paradise of outlaws and desperadoes  There was absolutely nosemblance of law there  Violence was the rule  Force was the onlyrecognized authority  The commonest misunderstandings were settled onthe spot with the revolver or the knife  Murders were done in open dayand with sparkling frequency and nobody thought of inquiring into themIt was considered that the parties who did the killing had their privatereasons for it for other people to meddle would have been looked upon asindelicate  After a murder all that Rocky Mountain etiquette requiredof a spectator was that he should help the gentleman bury his gameotherwise his churlishness would surely be remembered against him thefirst time he killed a man himself and needed a neighborly turn ininterring himSlade took up his residence sweetly and peacefully in the midst of thishive of horsethieves and assassins and the very first time one of themaired his insolent swaggerings in his presence he shot him dead  Hebegan a raid on the outlaws and in a singularly short space of time hehad completely stopped their depredations on the stage stock recovered alarge number of stolen horses killed several of the worst desperadoes ofthe district and gained such a dread ascendancy over the rest that theyrespected him admired him feared him obeyed him  He wrought the samemarvelous change in the ways of the community that had marked hisadministration at Overland City  He captured two men who had stolenoverland stock and with his own hands he hanged them  He was supremejudge in his district and he was jury and executioner likewiseand notonly in the case of offences against his employers but against passingemigrants as well  On one occasion some emigrants had their stock lostor stolen and told Slade who chanced to visit their camp  With asingle companion he rode to a ranch the owners of which he suspectedand opening the door commenced firing killing three and wounding thefourthFrom a bloodthirstily interesting little Montana book[The Vigilantesof Montana by Prof Thos J Dimsdale]I take this paragraph      While on the road Slade held absolute sway  He would ride down to      a station get into a quarrel turn the house out of windows and      maltreat the occupants most cruelly  The unfortunates had no means      of redress and were compelled to recuperate as best they couldOn one of these occasions it is said he killed the father of the finelittle halfbreed boy Jemmy whom he adopted and who lived with hiswidow after his execution  Stories of Slades hanging men and ofinnumerable assaults shootings stabbings and beatings in which he wasa principal actor form part of the legends of the stage line  As forminor quarrels and shootings it is absolutely certain that a minutehistory of Slades life would be one long record of such practicesSlade was a matchless marksman with a navy revolver  The legends saythat one morning at Rocky Ridge when he was feeling comfortable he sawa man approaching who had offended him some days beforeobserve the finememory he had for matters like thatand Gentlemen said Sladedrawing it is a good twentyyard shotIll clip the third button onhis coat  Which he did  The bystanders all admired it  And they allattended the funeral tooOn one occasion a man who kept a little whiskyshelf at the station didsomething which angered Sladeand went and made his will  A day or twoafterward Slade came in and called for some brandy  The man reachedunder the counter ostensibly to get a bottlepossibly to get somethingelse but Slade smiled upon him that peculiarly bland and satisfiedsmile of his which the neighbors had long ago learned to recognize as adeathwarrant in disguise and told him to none of thatpass out thehighpriced article  So the poor barkeeper had to turn his back andget the highpriced brandy from the shelf and when he faced around againhe was looking into the muzzle of Slades pistol  And the nextinstant added my informant impressively he was one of the deadestmen that ever livedThe stagedrivers and conductors told us that sometimes Slade would leavea hated enemy wholly unmolested unnoticed and unmentioned for weekstogetherhad done it once or twice at any rate  And some said theybelieved he did it in order to lull the victims into unwatchfulness sothat he could get the advantage of them and others said they believed hesaved up an enemy that way just as a schoolboy saves up a cake and madethe pleasure go as far as it would by gloating over the anticipationOne of these cases was that of a Frenchman who had offended SladeTo the surprise of everybody Slade did not kill him on the spot but lethim alone for a considerable time  Finally however he went to theFrenchmans house very late one night knocked and when his enemy openedthe door shot him deadpushed the corpse inside the door with his footset the house on fire and burned up the dead man his widow and threechildren  I heard this story from several different people and theyevidently believed what they were saying  It may be true and it maynot  Give a dog a bad name etcSlade was captured once by a party of men who intended to lynch himThey disarmed him and shut him up in a strong loghouse and placed aguard over him  He prevailed on his captors to send for his wife sothat he might have a last interview with her  She was a brave lovingspirited woman  She jumped on a horse and rode for life and deathWhen she arrived they let her in without searching her and before thedoor could be closed she whipped out a couple of revolvers and she andher lord marched forth defying the party  And then under a brisk firethey mounted double and galloped away unharmedIn the fulness of time Slades myrmidons captured his ancient enemyJules whom they found in a wellchosen hidingplace in the remotefastnesses of the mountains gaining a precarious livelihood with hisrifle  They brought him to Rocky Ridge bound hand and foot anddeposited him in the middle of the cattleyard with his back against apost  It is said that the pleasure that lit Slades face when he heardof it was something fearful to contemplate  He examined his enemy to seethat he was securely tied and then went to bed content to wait tillmorning before enjoying the luxury of killing him  Jules spent the nightin the cattleyard and it is a region where warm nights are never knownIn the morning Slade practised on him with his revolver nipping theflesh here and there and occasionally clipping off a finger while Julesbegged him to kill him outright and put him out of his misery  FinallySlade reloaded and walking up close to his victim made somecharacteristic remarks and then dispatched him  The body lay there halfa day nobody venturing to touch it without orders and then Sladedetailed a party and assisted at the burial himself  But he first cutoff the dead mans ears and put them in his vest pocket where he carriedthem for some time with great satisfaction  That is the story as I havefrequently heard it told and seen it in print in California newspapersIt is doubtless correct in all essential particularsIn due time we rattled up to a stagestation and sat down tobreakfast with a halfsavage halfcivilized company of armed andbearded mountaineers ranchmen and station employees  The mostgentlemanlyappearing quiet and affable officer we had yet found alongthe road in the Overland Companys service was the person who sat at thehead of the table at my elbow  Never youth stared and shivered as I didwhen I heard them call him SLADEHere was romance and I sitting face to face with itlooking upon ittouching ithobnobbing with it as it were  Here right by my side wasthe actual ogre who in fights and brawls and various ways had taken thelives of twentysix human beings or all men lied about him  I suppose Iwas the proudest stripling that ever traveled to see strange lands andwonderful peopleHe was so friendly and so gentlespoken that I warmed to him inspite of his awful history  It was hardly possible to realize thatthis pleasant person was the pitiless scourge of the outlaws therawheadandbloodybones the nursing mothers of the mountains terrifiedtheir children with And to this day I can remember nothing remarkableabout Slade except that his face was rather broad across the cheek bonesand that the cheek bones were low and the lips peculiarly thin andstraight  But that was enough to leave something of an effect upon mefor since then I seldom see a face possessing those characteristicswithout fancying that the owner of it is a dangerous manThe coffee ran out  At least it was reduced to one tincupful and Sladewas about to take it when he saw that my cup was emptyHe politely offered to fill it but although I wanted it I politelydeclined  I was afraid he had not killed anybody that morning and mightbe needing diversion  But still with firm politeness he insisted onfilling my cup and said I had traveled all night and better deserved itthan heand while he talked he placidly poured the fluid to the lastdrop  I thanked him and drank it but it gave me no comfort for I couldnot feel sure that he would not be sorry presently that he had given itaway and proceed to kill me to distract his thoughts from the lossBut nothing of the kind occurred  We left him with only twentysix deadpeople to account for and I felt a tranquil satisfaction in the thoughtthat in so judiciously taking care of No 1 at that breakfasttable I hadpleasantly escaped being No 27  Slade came out to the coach and saw usoff first ordering certain rearrangements of the mailbags for ourcomfort and then we took leave of him satisfied that we should hear ofhim again some day and wondering in what connectionEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Roughing It Part 1by Mark Twain Samuel Clemens END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROUGHING IT PART 1
