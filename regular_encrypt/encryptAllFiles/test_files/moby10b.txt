Project Gutenberg one pageWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work  Thetime it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hoursto get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyrightsearched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  Thisprojected audience is one hundred million readers  If our valueper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix textfiles per month or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000If these reach just 10 of the computerized population then thetotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this yearThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion EtextFiles by December 31 2001  [10000 x 100000000  1 Trillion]This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readerswhich is only 5 of the present number of computer usersAt our revised rates of production we will reach only onethirdof that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 Etexts unless wemanage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostlyfrom Michael Harts salary at CarnegieMellon University and anassortment of sporadic gifts this salary is

you there by a pool in the stream  There ismagic in it  Let the most absentminded of men be plunged in hisdeepest reveriesstand that man on his legs set his feet agoingand he will infallibly lead you to water if water there be in allthat region  Should you ever be athirst in the great Americandesert try this experiment if your caravan happen to be suppliedwith a metaphysical professor  Yes as every one knows meditationand water are wedded for everBut here is an artist  He desires to paint you the dreamiestshadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in allthe valley of the Saco  What is the chief element he employs  Therestand his trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and acrucifix were within and here sleeps his meadow and there sleep hiscattle and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke  Deep intodistant woodlands winds a mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs ofmountains bathed in their hillside blue  But though the picturelies thus tranced and though this pinetree shakes down its sighslike leaves upon this shepherds head yet all were vain unless theshepherds eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him  Go visitthe Prairies in June when for scores on scores of miles you wadekneedeep among Tigerlilieswhat is the one charmwantingWaterthere is not a drop of water there  Were Niagarabut a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to seeit  Why did the poor poet of Tennessee upon suddenly receiving twohandfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which hesadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to RockawayBeach  Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthysoul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea  Why upon yourfirst voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mysticalvibration when first told that you and your ship were now out ofsight of land  Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy  Why didthe Greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of Jove  Surelyall this is not without meaning  And still deeper the meaning ofthat story of Narcissus who because he could not grasp thetormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it andwas drowned  But that same image we ourselves see in all rivers andoceans  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and thisis the key to it allNow when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever Ibegin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious ofmy lungs I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea asa passenger  For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purseand a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it  Besidespassengers get seasickgrow quarrelsomedont sleep of nightsdonot enjoy themselves much as a general thingno I never go as apassenger nor though I am something of a salt do I ever go to seaas a Commodore or a Captain or a Cook  I abandon the glory anddistinction of such offices to those who like them  For my part Iabominate all honourable respectable toils trials and tribulationsof every kind whatsoever  It is quite as much as I can do to takecare of myself without taking care of ships barques brigsschooners and what not  And as for going as cookthough I confessthere is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officeron shipboardyet somehow I never fancied broiling fowlsthoughonce broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted andpeppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not tosay reverentially of a broiled fowl than I will  It is out of theidolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roastedriver horse that you see the mummies of those creatures in theirhuge bakehouses the pyramidsNo when I go to sea I go as a simple sailor right before the mastplumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal mastheadTrue they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar tospar like a grasshopper in a May meadow  And at first this sort ofthing is unpleasant enough  It touches ones sense of honourparticularly if you come of an old established family in the landthe Van Rensselaers or Randolphs or Hardicanutes  And more thanall if just previous to putting your hand into the tarpot you havebeen lording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boysstand in awe of you  The transition is a keen one I assure youfrom a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction ofSeneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it  But eventhis wears off in timeWhat of it if some old hunks of a seacaptain orders me to get abroom and sweep down the decks  What does that indignity amount toweighed I mean in the scales of the New Testament  Do you thinkthe archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me because Ipromptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particularinstance  Who aint a slave  Tell me that  Well then however theold seacaptains may order me abouthowever they may thump and punchme about I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all rightthat everybody else is one way or other served in much the samewayeither in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is andso the universal thump is passed round and all hands should rub eachothers shoulderblades and be contentAgain I always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point ofpaying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a singlepenny that I ever heard of  On the contrary passengers themselvesmust pay  And there is all the difference in the world betweenpaying and being paid  The act of paying is perhaps the mostuncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed uponus  But BEING PAIDwhat will compare with it  The urbane activitywith which a man receives money is really marvellous consideringthat we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthlyills and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven  Ah howcheerfully we consign ourselves to perditionFinally I always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesomeexercise and pure air of the forecastle deck  For as in this worldhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is ifyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim so for the most part theCommodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand fromthe sailors on the forecastle  He thinks he breathes it first butnot so  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders inmany other things at the same time that the leaders little suspectit  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the seaas a merchant sailor I should now take it into my head to go on awhaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the Fates whohas the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me andinfluences me in some unaccountable wayhe can better answer thanany one else  And doubtless my going on this whaling voyageformed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up along time ago  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solobetween more extensive performances  I take it that this part of thebill must have run something like thisGRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATESWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAELBLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTANThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managersthe Fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage whenothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies andshort and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts infarcesthough I cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that Irecall all the circumstances I think I can see a little into thesprings and motives which being cunningly presented to me undervarious disguises induced me to set about performing the part I didbesides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resultingfrom my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgmentChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the greatwhale himself  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused allmy curiosity  Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled hisisland bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale thesewith all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights andsounds helped to sway me to my wish  With other men perhaps suchthings would not have been inducements but as for me I am tormentedwith an everlasting itch for things remote  I love to sail forbiddenseas and land on barbarous coasts  Not ignoring what is good I amquick to perceive a horror and could still be social with itwouldthey let mesince it is but well to be on friendly terms with allthe inmates of the place one lodges inBy reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome thegreat floodgates of the wonderworld swung open and in the wildconceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated intomy inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most ofthem all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the airCHAPTER 2The CarpetBagI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tucked it under myarm and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific  Quitting the goodcity of old Manhatto I duly arrived in New Bedford  It was aSaturday night in December  Much was I disappointed upon learningthat the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed and that noway of reaching that place would offer till the following MondayAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stopat this same New Bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may aswell be related that I for one had no idea of so doing  For mymind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft becausethere was a fine boisterous something about everything connectedwith that famous old island which amazingly pleased me  Besidesthough New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising thebusiness of whaling and though in this matter poor old Nantucket isnow much behind her yet Nantucket was her great originalthe Tyreof this Carthagethe place where the first dead American whale wasstranded  Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginalwhalemen the RedMen first sally out in canoes to give chase to theLeviathan  And where but from Nantucket too did that firstadventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with importedcobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales in order todiscover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from thebowspritNow having a night a day and still another night following beforeme in New Bedford ere I could embark for my destined port itbecame a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleepmeanwhile  It was a very dubiouslooking nay a very dark anddismal night bitingly cold and cheerless  I knew no one in theplace  With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket and onlybrought up a few pieces of silverSo wherever you go Ishmaelsaid I to myself as I stood in the middle of a dreary streetshouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north withthe darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you mayconclude to lodge for the night my dear Ishmael be sure to inquirethe price and dont be too particularWith halting steps I paced the streets and passed the sign of TheCrossed Harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly thereFurther on from the bright red windows of the SwordFish Innthere came such fervent rays that it seemed to have melted thepacked snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else thecongealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard asphalticpavementrather weary for me when I struck my foot against theflinty projections because from hard remorseless service the solesof my boots were in a most miserable plight  Too expensive andjolly again thought I pausing one moment to watch the broad glarein the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses withinBut go on Ishmael said I at last dont you hear get away frombefore the door your patched boots are stopping the way  So on Iwent  I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterwardfor there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest innsSuch dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on eitherhand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in atomb  At this hour of the night of the last day of the week thatquarter of the town proved all but deserted  But presently I came toa smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of whichstood invitingly open  It had a careless look as if it were meantfor the uses of the public so entering the first thing I did wasto stumble over an ashbox in the porch  Ha thought I ha as theflying particles almost choked me are these ashes from thatdestroyed city Gomorrah  But The Crossed Harpoons and TheSwordFishthis then must needs be the sign of The TrapHowever I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushedon and opened a second interior doorIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet  A hundredblack faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a blackAngel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit  It was a negro churchand the preachers text was about the blackness of darkness and theweeping and wailing and teethgnashing there  Ha Ishmael mutteredI backing out Wretched entertainment at the sign of The TrapMoving on I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from thedocks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw aswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintlyrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray and these wordsunderneathThe Spouter InnPeter CoffinCoffinSpouterRather ominous in that particular connexionthought I  But it is a common name in Nantucket they say and Isuppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there  As the lightlooked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough andthe dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might havebeen carted here from the ruins of some burnt district and as theswinging sign had a povertystricken sort of creak to it I thoughtthat here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of peacoffeeIt was a queer sort of placea gableended old house one sidepalsied as it were and leaning over sadly  It stood on a sharpbleak corner where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worsehowling than ever it did about poor Pauls tossed craft  Euroclydonnevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors withhis feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed  In judging of thattempestuous wind called Euroclydon says an old writerof whoseworks I possess the only copy extantit maketh a marvellousdifference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window wherethe frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it fromthat sashless window where the frost is on both sides and of whichthe wight Death is the only glazier  True enough thought I asthis passage occurred to my mindold blackletter thou reasonestwell  Yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is thehouse  What a pity they didnt stop up the chinks and the cranniesthough and thrust in a little lint here and there  But its toolate to make any improvements now  The universe is finished thecopestone is on and the chips were carted off a million years agoPoor Lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone forhis pillow and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings he mightplug up both ears with rags and put a corncob into his mouth andyet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon  Euroclydonsays old Dives in his red silken wrapperhe had a redder oneafterwards pooh pooh  What a fine frosty night how Orionglitters what northern lights  Let them talk of their orientalsummer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilege ofmaking my own summer with my own coalsBut what thinks Lazarus  Can he warm his blue hands by holding themup to the grand northern lights  Would not Lazarus rather be inSumatra than here  Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwisealong the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pititself in order to keep out this frostNow that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone beforethe door of Dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg shouldbe moored to one of the Moluccas  Yet Dives himself he too liveslike a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being apresident of a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears oforphansBut no more of this blubbering now we are going awhaling and thereis plenty of that yet to come  Let us scrape the ice from ourfrosted feet and see what sort of a place this Spouter may beCHAPTER 3The SpouterInnEntering that gableended SpouterInn you found yourself in a widelow straggling entry with oldfashioned wainscots reminding one ofthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft  On one side hung a verylarge oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defacedthat in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was onlyby diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it andcareful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at anunderstanding of its purpose  Such unaccountable masses of shadesand shadows that at first you almost thought some ambitious youngartist in the time of the New England hags had endeavored todelineate chaos bewitched  But by dint of much and earnestcontemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially bythrowing open the little window towards the back of the entry you atlast come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild mightnot be altogether unwarrantedBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limberportentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of thepicture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in anameless yeast  A boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough todrive a nervous man distracted  Yet was there a sort of indefinitehalfattained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze youto it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find outwhat that marvellous painting meant  Ever and anon a bright butalas deceptive idea would dart you throughIts the Black Sea in amidnight galeIts the unnatural combat of the four primalelementsIts a blasted heathIts a Hyperborean wintersceneIts the breakingup of the icebound stream of Time  But atlast all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something inthe pictures midst  THAT once found out and all the rest wereplain  But stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a giganticfish even the great leviathan himselfIn fact the artists design seemed this a final theory of my ownpartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons withwhom I conversed upon the subject  The picture represents aCapeHorner in a great hurricane the halffoundered ship welteringthere with its three dismantled masts alone visible and anexasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is inthe enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mastheadsThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenisharray of monstrous clubs and spears  Some were thickly set withglittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knotsof human hair and one was sickleshaped with a vast handle sweepinground like the segment made in the newmown grass by a longarmedmower  You shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrouscannibal and savage could ever have gone a deathharvesting with sucha hacking horrifying implement  Mixed with these were rusty oldwhaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed  Some werestoried weapons  With this once long lance now wildly elbowedfifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between asunrise and a sunset  And that harpoonso like a corkscrew nowwasflung in Javan seas and run away with by a whale years afterwardsslain off the Cape of Blanco  The original iron entered nigh thetail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a mantravelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in thehumpCrossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched waycutthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney withfireplaces all roundyou enter the public room  A still duskierplace is this with such low ponderous beams above and such oldwrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod someold crafts cockpits especially of such a howling night when thiscorneranchored old ark rocked so furiously  On one side stood along low shelflike table covered with cracked glass cases filledwith dusty rarities gathered from this wide worlds remotest nooksProjecting from the further angle of the room stands a darklookingdenthe bara rude attempt at a right whales head  Be that how itmay there stands the vast arched bone of the whales jaw so wide acoach might almost drive beneath it  Within are shabby shelvesranged round with old decanters bottles flasks and in those jawsof swift destruction like another cursed Jonah by which name indeedthey called him bustles a little withered old man who for theirmoney dearly sells the sailors deliriums and deathAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison  Thoughtrue cylinders withoutwithin the villanous green goggling glassesdeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom  Parallelmeridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpadsgoblets  Fill to THIS mark and your charge is but a penny to THISa penny more and so on to the full glassthe Cape Horn measurewhich you may gulp down for a shillingUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gatheredabout a table examining by a dim light divers specimens ofSKRIMSHANDER  I sought the landlord and telling him I desired to beaccommodated with a room received for answer that his house wasfullnot a bed unoccupied  But avast he added tapping hisforehead you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneers blankethave ye  I spose you are goin awhalin so youd better get usedto that sort of thingI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed that if I shouldever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be andthat if he the landlord really had no other place for me and theharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wanderfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night I would put upwith the half of any decent mans blanketI thought so  All right take a seat  Supperyou want supperSupperll be ready directlyI sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench onthe Battery  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorningit with his jackknife stooping over and diligently working away atthe space between his legs  He was trying his hand at a ship underfull sail but he didnt make much headway I thoughtAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in anadjoining room  It was cold as Icelandno fire at allthe landlordsaid he couldnt afford it  Nothing but two dismal tallow candleseach in a winding sheet  We were fain to button up our monkeyjackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our halffrozen fingers  But the fare was of the most substantial kindnotonly meat and potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings forsupper  One young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself tothese dumplings in a most direful mannerMy boy said the landlord youll have the nightmare to a deadsartaintyLandlord I whispered that aint the harpooneer is itOh no said he looking a sort of diabolically funny theharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap  He never eats dumplings hedonthe eats nothing but steaks and he likes em rareThe devil he does says I  Where is that harpooneer  Is hehereHell be here afore long was the answerI could not help it but I began to feel suspicious of this darkcomplexioned harpooneer  At any rate I made up my mind that if itso turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and getinto bed before I didSupper over the company went back to the barroom when knowing notwhat else to do with myself I resolved to spend the rest of theevening as a looker onPresently a rioting noise was heard without  Starting up thelandlord cried Thats the Grampuss crew  I seed her reported inthe offing this morning a three years voyage and a full shipHurrah boys now well have the latest news from the FeegeesA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flungopen and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough  Enveloped intheir shaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollencomforters all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff withicicles they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador  They hadjust landed from their boat and this was the first house theyentered  No wonder then that they made a straight wake for thewhales mouththe barwhen the wrinkled little old Jonah thereofficiating soon poured them out brimmers all round  One complainedof a bad cold in his head upon which Jonah mixed him a pitchlikepotion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure forall colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standingor whether caught off the coast of Labrador or on the weather sideof an iceislandThe liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does evenwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they begancapering about most obstreperouslyI observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and thoughhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by hisown sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as muchnoise as the rest  This man interested me at once and since theseagods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate thoughbut a sleepingpartner one so far as this narrative is concernedI will here venture upon a little description of him  He stood fullsix feet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like acofferdam  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man  His face wasdeeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by thecontrast while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated somereminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy  His voice atonce announced that he was a Southerner and from his fine stature Ithought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from theAlleghanian Ridge in Virginia  When the revelry of his companionshad mounted to its height this man slipped away unobserved and Isaw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea  In a fewminutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being itseems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cryof Bulkington  Bulkington wheres Bulkington and darted out ofthe house in pursuit of himIt was now about nine oclock and the room seeming almostsupernaturally quiet after these orgies I began to congratulatemyself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous tothe entrance of the seamenNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed  In fact you would a good dealrather not sleep with your own brother  I dont know how it is butpeople like to be private when they are sleeping  And when it comesto sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strangetown and that stranger a harpooneer then your objectionsindefinitely multiply  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as asailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailorsno more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor Kings do ashore  Tobe sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have yourown hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep inyour own skinThe more I pondered over this harpooneer the more I abominated thethought of sleeping with him  It was fair to presume that being aharpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not beof the tidiest certainly none of the finest  I began to twitch allover  Besides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer oughtto be home and going bedwards  Suppose now he should tumble in uponme at midnighthow could I tell from what vile hole he had beencomingLandlord  Ive changed my mind about that harpooneerI shantsleep with him  Ill try the bench hereJust as you please Im sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for amattress and its a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knotsand notches  But wait a bit Skrimshander Ive got a carpentersplane there in the barwait I say and Ill make ye snug enoughSo saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchieffirst dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bedthe while grinning like an ape  The shavings flew right and lefttill at last the planeiron came bump against an indestructible knotThe landlord was near spraining his wrist and I told him forheavens sake to quitthe bed was soft enough to suit me and I didnot know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of apine plank  So gathering up the shavings with another grin andthrowing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he wentabout his business and left me in a brown studyI now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot tooshort but that could be mended with a chair  But it was a foot toonarrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higherthan the planed oneso there was no yoking them  I then placed thefirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wallleaving a little interval between for my back to settle down inBut I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over mefrom under the sill of the window that this plan would never do atall especially as another current from the rickety door met the onefrom the window and both together formed a series of smallwhirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thoughtto spend the nightThe devil fetch that harpooneer thought I but stop couldnt Isteal a march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bednot to be wakened by the most violent knockings  It seemed no badidea but upon second thoughts I dismissed it  For who could tellbut what the next morning so soon as I popped out of the room theharpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock medownStill looking round me again and seeing no possible chance ofspending a sufferable night unless in some other persons bed Ibegan to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantableprejudices against this unknown harpooneer  Thinks I Ill waitawhile he must be dropping in before long  Ill have a good look athim then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows afteralltheres no tellingBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos andthrees and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneerLandlord said I what sort of a chap is hedoes he always keepsuch late hours  It was now hard upon twelve oclockThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to bemightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension  No heanswered generally hes an early birdairley to bed and airley toriseyes hes the bird what catches the worm  But tonight hewent out a peddling you see and I dont see what on airth keeps himso late unless may be he cant sell his headCant sell his headWhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this youare telling me getting into a towering rage  Do you pretend tosay landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessedSaturday night or rather Sunday morning in peddling his head aroundthis townThats precisely it said the landlord and I told him he couldntsell it here the markets overstockedWith what shouted IWith heads to be sure aint there too many heads in the worldI tell you what it is landlord said I quite calmly youd betterstop spinning that yarn to meIm not greenMay be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but Irayther guess youll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you aslanderin his headIll break it for him said I now flying into a passion again atthis unaccountable farrago of the landlordsIts broke aready said heBroke said IBROKE do you meanSartain and thats the very reason he cant sell it I guessLandlord said I going up to him as cool as Mt Hecla in asnowstormlandlord stop whittling  You and I must understand oneanother and that too without delay  I come to your house and want abed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other halfbelongs to a certain harpooneer  And about this harpooneer whom Ihave not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying andexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feelingtowards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort ofconnexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in thehighest degree  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who andwhat this harpooneer is and whether I shall be in all respects safeto spend the night with him  And in the first place you will be sogood as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true Itake to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and Iveno idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir YOU I meanlandlord YOU sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly wouldthereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecutionWall said the landlord fetching a long breath thats a purtylong sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then  But be easybe easy this here harpooneer I have been tellin you of has justarrived from the south seas where he bought up a lot of balmed NewZealand heads great curios you know and hes sold all on em butone and that one hes trying to sell tonight cause tomorrowsSunday and it would not do to be sellin human heads about thestreets when folks is goin to churches  He wanted to last Sundaybut I stopped him just as he was goin out of the door with fourheads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inionsThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery andshowed that the landlord after all had had no idea of foolingmebut at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer whostayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath engagedin such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolatorsDepend upon it landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous manHe pays reglar was the rejoinder  But come its gettingdreadful late you had better be turning flukesits a nice bedSal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced  Theresplenty of room for two to kick about in that bed its an almightybig bed that  Why afore we give it up Sal used to put our Sam andlittle Johnny in the foot of it  But I got a dreaming and sprawlingabout one night and somehow Sam got pitched on the floor and camenear breaking his arm  Arter that Sal said it wouldnt do  Comealong here Ill give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighteda candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way  But Istood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimedI vum its Sundayyou wont see that harpooneer tonight hes cometo anchor somewherecome along then DO come WONT ye comeI considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and Iwas ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sureenough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any fourharpooneers to sleep abreastThere said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old seachest that did double duty as a washstand and centre table theremake yourself comfortable now and good night to ye  I turnedround from eyeing the bed but he had disappearedFolding back the counterpane I stooped over the bed  Though none ofthe most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well  I thenglanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre tablecould see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rudeshelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing a manstriking a whale  Of things not properly belonging to the roomthere was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in onecorner also a large seamans bag containing the harpooneerswardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk  Likewise there was aparcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over thefireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bedBut what is this on the chest  I took it up and held it close tothe light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible toarrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it  I can compareit to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges withlittle tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quillsround an Indian moccasin  There was a hole or slit in the middle ofthis mat as you see the same in South American ponchos  But couldit be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door matand parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guiseI put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper beinguncommonly shaggy and thick and I thought a little damp as thoughthis mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day  Iwent up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and I neversaw such a sight in my life  I tore myself out of it in such a hurrythat I gave myself a kink in the neckI sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about thisheadpeddling harpooneer and his door mat  After thinking some timeon the bedside I got up and took off my monkey jacket and thenstood in the middle of the room thinking  I then took off my coatand thought a little more in my shirt sleeves  But beginning to feelvery cold now half undressed as I was and remembering what thelandlord said about the harpooneers not coming home at all thatnight it being so very late I made no more ado but jumped out ofmy pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled intobed and commended myself to the care of heavenWhether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockerythere is no telling but I rolled about a good deal and could notsleep for a long time  At last I slid off into a light doze and hadpretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod when Iheard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of lightcome into the room from under the doorLord save me thinks I that must be the harpooneer the infernalheadpeddler  But I lay perfectly still and resolved not to say aword till spoken to  Holding a light in one hand and that identicalNew Zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room andwithout looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way offfrom me on the floor in one corner and then began working away atthe knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in theroom  I was all eagerness to see his face but he kept it avertedfor some time while employed in unlacing the bags mouth  Thisaccomplished however he turned roundwhen good heavens what asight  Such a face  It was of a dark purplish yellow colour hereand there stuck over with large blackish looking squares  Yes itsjust as I thought hes a terrible bedfellow hes been in a fightgot dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon  But atthat moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that Iplainly saw they could not be stickingplasters at all those blacksquares on his cheeks  They were stains of some sort or other  Atfirst I knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of thetruth occurred to me  I remembered a story of a white manawhaleman toowho falling among the cannibals had been tattooed bythem  I concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distantvoyages must have met with a similar adventure  And what is itthought I after all  Its only his outside a man can be honest inany sort of skin  But then what to make of his unearthlycomplexion that part of it I mean lying round about andcompletely independent of the squares of tattooing  To be sure itmight be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but I neverheard of a hot suns tanning a white man into a purplish yellow oneHowever I had never been in the South Seas and perhaps the sunthere produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin  Now whileall these ideas were passing through me like lightning thisharpooneer never noticed me at all  But after some difficultyhaving opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presentlypulled out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hairon  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room hethen took the New Zealand heada ghastly thing enoughand crammedit down into the bag  He now took off his hata new beaverhatwhen I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise  There was nohair on his headnone to speak of at leastnothing but a smallscalpknot twisted up on his forehead  His bald purplish head nowlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull  Had not the strangerstood between me and the door I would have bolted out of it quickerthan ever I bolted a dinnerEven as it was I thought something of slipping out of the windowbut it was the second floor back  I am no coward but what to makeof this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed mycomprehension  Ignorance is the parent of fear and being completelynonplussed and confounded about the stranger I confess I was now asmuch afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus brokeninto my room at the dead of night  In fact I was so afraid of himthat I was not game enough just then to address him and demand asatisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in himMeanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at lastshowed his chest and arms  As I live these covered parts of himwere checkered with the same squares as his face his back too wasall over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a ThirtyYears War and just escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirtStill more his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark greenfrogs were running up the trunks of young palms  It was now quiteplain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboardof a whaleman in the South Seas and so landed in this Christiancountry  I quaked to think of it  A peddler of heads tooperhapsthe heads of his own brothers  He might take a fancy tomineheavens look at that tomahawkBut there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went aboutsomething that completely fascinated my attention and convinced methat he must indeed be a heathen  Going to his heavy grego orwrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair hefumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious littledeformed image with a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of athree days old Congo baby  Remembering the embalmed head at firstI almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preservedin some similar manner  But seeing that it was not at all limberand that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony I concludedthat it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved tobe  For now the savage goes up to the empty fireplace and removingthe papered fireboard sets up this little hunchbacked image likea tenpin between the andirons  The chimney jambs and all the bricksinside were very sooty so that I thought this fireplace made a veryappropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idolI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling butill at ease meantimeto see what was next to follow  First he takesabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket andplaces them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of shipbiscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled theshavings into a sacrificial blaze  Presently after many hastysnatches into the fire and still hastier withdrawals of his fingerswhereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeededin drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes alittle he made a polite offer of it to the little negro  But thelittle devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all henever moved his lips  All these strange antics were accompanied bystill stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to bepraying in a singsong or else singing some pagan psalmody or otherduring which his face twitched about in the most unnatural mannerAt last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up veryunceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket ascarelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcockAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness andseeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his businessoperations and jumping into bed with me I thought it was high timenow or never before the light was put out to break the spell inwhich I had so long been boundBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say was a fatalone  Taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head ofit for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouthat the handle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke  The nextmoment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawkbetween his teeth sprang into bed with me  I sang out I could nothelp it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he beganfeeling meStammering out something I knew not what I rolled away from himagainst the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he mightbe to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again  Buthis guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but illcomprehended my meaningWhoe debel youhe at last saidyou no speake damme Ikille  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing aboutme in the darkLandlord for Gods sake Peter Coffin shouted I  LandlordWatch  Coffin  Angels save meSpeake tellee me whoee be or damme I kille again growledthe cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scatteredthe hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get onfire  But thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into theroom light in hand and leaping from the bed I ran up to himDont be afraid now said he grinning again Queequeg herewouldnt harm a hair of your headStop your grinning shouted I and why didnt you tell me thatthat infernal harpooneer was a cannibalI thought ye knowd itdidnt I tell ye he was a peddlin headsaround townbut turn flukes again and go to sleep  Queequeg lookhereyou sabbee me I sabbeeyou this man sleepe youyou sabbeeMe sabbee plentygrunted Queequeg puffing away at his pipe andsitting up in bedYou gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk andthrowing the clothes to one side  He really did this in not only acivil but a really kind and charitable way  I stood looking at him amoment  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comelylooking cannibal  Whats all this fuss I have been making aboutthought I to myselfthe mans a human being just as I am he hasjust as much reason to fear me as I have to be afraid of himBetter sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken ChristianLandlord said I tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipeor whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and Iwill turn in with him  But I dont fancy having a man smoking in bedwith me  Its dangerous  Besides I aint insuredThis being told to Queequeg he at once complied and again politelymotioned me to get into bedrolling over to one side as much as tosayI wont touch a leg of yeGood night landlord said I you may goI turned in and never slept better in my lifeCHAPTER 4The CounterpaneUpon waking next morning about daylight I found Queequegs armthrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner  You hadalmost thought I had been his wife  The counterpane was ofpatchwork full of odd little particoloured squares and trianglesand this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretanlabyrinth of a figure no two parts of which were of one preciseshadeowing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodicallyin sun and shade his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at varioustimesthis same arm of his I say looked for all the world like astrip of that same patchwork quilt  Indeed partly lying on it asthe arm did when I first awoke I could hardly tell it from thequilt they so blended their hues together and it was only by thesense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg washugging meMy sensations were strange  Let me try to explain them  When I wasa child I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befellme whether it was a reality or a dream I never could entirelysettle  The circumstance was this  I had been cutting up some caperor otherI think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as I hadseen a little sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother whosomehow or other was all the time whipping me or sending me to bedsupperlessmy mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney andpacked me off to bed though it was only two oclock in the afternoonof the 21st June the longest day in the year in our hemisphere  Ifelt dreadfully  But there was no help for it so up stairs I wentto my little room in the third floor undressed myself as slowly aspossible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between thesheetsI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours mustelapse before I could hope for a resurrection  Sixteen hours in bedthe small of my back ached to think of it  And it was so light toothe sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches inthe streets and the sound of gay voices all over the house  I feltworse and worseat last I got up dressed and softly going down inmy stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threwmyself at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me agood slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemningme to lie abed such an unendurable length of time  But she was thebest and most conscientious of stepmothers and back I had to go tomy room  For several hours I lay there broad awake feeling a greatdeal worse than I have ever done since even from the greatestsubsequent misfortunes  At last I must have fallen into a troublednightmare of a doze and slowly waking from ithalf steeped indreamsI opened my eyes and the before sunlit room was now wrappedin outer darkness  Instantly I felt a shock running through all myframe nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but asupernatural hand seemed placed in mine  My arm hung over thecounterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantomto which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bedsideFor what seemed ages piled on ages I lay there frozen with the mostawful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking thatif I could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would bebroken  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away fromme but waking in the morning I shudderingly remembered it all andfor days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confoundingattempts to explain the mystery  Nay to this very hour I oftenpuzzle myself with itNow take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling thesupernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangenessto those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequegs paganarm thrown round me  But at length all the past nights eventssoberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then I lay onlyalive to the comical predicament  For though I tried to move hisarmunlock his bridegroom claspyet sleeping as he was he stillhugged me tightly as though naught but death should part us twainI now strove to rouse himQueequegbut his only answer was asnore  I then rolled over my neck feeling as if it were in ahorsecollar and suddenly felt a slight scratch  Throwing aside thecounterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savages side asif it were a hatchetfaced baby  A pretty pickle truly thought Iabed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and atomahawk  Queequegin the name of goodness Queequeg wake  Atlength by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessantexpostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow malein that matrimonial sort of style I succeeded in extracting a gruntand presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like aNewfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff as apikestaff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he did notaltogether remember how I came to be there though a dimconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawningover him  Meanwhile I lay quietly eyeing him having no seriousmisgivings now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious acreature  When at last his mind seemed made up touching thecharacter of his bedfellow and he became as it were reconciled tothe fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain signs andsounds gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dressfirst and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the wholeapartment to myself  Thinks I Queequeg under the circumstancesthis is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savageshave an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvelloushow essentially polite they are  I pay this particular compliment toQueequeg because he treated me with so much civility andconsideration while I was guilty of great rudeness staring at himfrom the bed and watching all his toilette motions for the time mycuriosity getting the better of my breeding  Nevertheless a manlike Queequeg you dont see every day he and his ways were wellworth unusual regardingHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tallone by the by and thenstill minus his trowsershe hunted up hisboots  What under the heavens he did it for I cannot tell but hisnext movement was to crush himselfboots in hand and hat onunderthe bed when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings Iinferred he was hard at work booting himself though by no law ofpropriety that I ever heard of is any man required to be privatewhen putting on his boots  But Queequeg do you see was a creaturein the transition stageneither caterpillar nor butterfly  He wasjust enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangestpossible manners  His education was not yet completed  He was anundergraduate  If he had not been a small degree civilized he veryprobably would not have troubled himself with boots at all but thenif he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt ofgetting under the bed to put them on  At last he emerged with hishat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes and begancreaking and limping about the room as if not being much accustomedto boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide onesprobably not madeto order eitherrather pinched and tormented him at the first go offof a bitter cold morningSeeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that thestreet being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain viewinto the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure thatQueequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and bootson I begged him as well as I could to accelerate his toiletsomewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon aspossible  He complied and then proceeded to wash himself  At thattime in the morning any Christian would have washed his face butQueequeg to my amazement contented himself with restricting hisablutions to his chest arms and hands  He then donned hiswaistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the washstandcentre table dipped it into water and commenced lathering his faceI was watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold hetakes the harpoon from the bed corner slips out the long woodenstock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot andstriding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorousscraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks  Thinks I Queequegthis is using Rogerss best cutlery with a vengeance  Afterwards Iwondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what finesteel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp thelong straight edges are always keptThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved and he proudly marched outof the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket andsporting his harpoon like a marshals batonCHAPTER 5BreakfastI quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accostedthe grinning landlord very pleasantly  I cherished no malice towardshim though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matterof my bedfellowHowever a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce agood thing the mores the pity  So if any one man in his ownproper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him notbe backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and bespent in that way  And the man that has anything bountifullylaughable about him be sure there is more in that man than youperhaps think forThe barroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping inthe night previous and whom I had not as yet had a good look atThey were nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates andthird mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and seablacksmiths and harpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawnycompany with bosky beards an unshorn shaggy set all wearingmonkey jackets for morning gownsYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashoreThis young fellows healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hueand would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been threedays landed from his Indian voyage  That man next him looks a fewshades lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him  Inthe complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightlybleached withal HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore  Butwho could show a cheek like Queequeg which barred with varioustints seemed like the Andes western slope to show forth in onearray contrasting climates zone by zoneGrub ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in wewent to breakfastThey say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite atease in manner quite selfpossessed in company  Not always thoughLedyard the great New England traveller and Mungo Park the Scotchone of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlorBut perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs asLedyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomachin the negro heart of Africa which was the sum of poor Mungosperformancesthis kind of travel I say may not be the very bestmode of attaining a high social polish  Still for the most partthat sort of thing is to be had anywhereThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance thatafter we were all seated at the table and I was preparing to hearsome good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearlyevery man maintained a profound silence  And not only that but theylooked embarrassed  Yes here were a set of seadogs many of whomwithout the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on thehigh seasentire strangers to themand duelled them dead withoutwinking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast tableall ofthe same calling all of kindred tasteslooking round as sheepishlyat each other as though they had never been out of sight of somesheepfold among the Green Mountains  A curious sight these bashfulbears these timid warrior whalemenBut as for Queequegwhy Queequeg sat there among themat the headof the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle  To be sure Icannot say much for his breeding  His greatest admirer could nothave cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast withhim and using it there without ceremony reaching over the tablewith it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling thebeefsteaks towards him  But THAT was certainly very coolly done byhim and every one knows that in most peoples estimation to doanything coolly is to do it genteellyWe will not speak of all Queequegs peculiarities here how heeschewed coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention tobeefsteaks done rare  Enough that when breakfast was over hewithdrew like the rest into the public room lighted histomahawkpipe and was sitting there quietly digesting and smokingwith his inseparable hat on when I sallied out for a strollCHAPTER 6The StreetIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandishan individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of acivilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my firstdaylight stroll through the streets of New BedfordIn thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport willfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts fromforeign parts  Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets Mediterraneanmariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies  Regent Streetis not unknown to Lascars and Malays and at Bombay in the ApolloGreen live Yankees have often scared the natives  But New Bedfordbeats all Water Street and Wapping  In these lastmentioned hauntsyou see only sailors but in New Bedford actual cannibals standchatting at street corners savages outright many of whom yet carryon their bones unholy flesh  It makes a stranger stareBut besides the Feegeeans Tongatobooarrs ErromanggoansPannangians and Brighggians and besides the wild specimens of thewhalingcraft which unheeded reel about the streets you will seeother sights still more curious certainly more comical  Thereweekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and NewHampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery  Theyare mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felledforests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whalelanceMany are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came  In somethings you would think them but a few hours old  Look there thatchap strutting round the corner  He wears a beaver hat andswallowtailed coat girdled with a sailorbelt and sheathknifeHere comes another with a souwester and a bombazine cloakNo townbred dandy will compare with a countrybred oneI mean adownright bumpkin dandya fellow that in the dogdays will mow histwo acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands  Now whena country dandy like this takes it into his head to make adistinguished reputation and joins the great whalefishery youshould see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport  Inbespeaking his seaoutfit he orders bellbuttons to his waistcoatsstraps to his canvas trowsers  Ah poor HaySeed how bitterly willburst those straps in the first howling gale when thou art drivenstraps buttons and all down the throat of the tempestBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibalsand bumpkins to show her visitors  Not at all  Still New Bedford isa queer place  Had it not been for us whalemen that tract of landwould this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coastof Labrador  As it is parts of her back country are enough tofrighten one they look so bony  The town itself is perhaps thedearest place to live in in all New England  It is a land of oiltrue enough but not like Canaan a land also of corn and wineThe streets do not run with milk nor in the springtime do they pavethem with fresh eggs  Yet in spite of this nowhere in all Americawill you find more patricianlike houses parks and gardens moreopulent than in New Bedford  Whence came they how planted uponthis once scraggy scoria of a countryGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder loftymansion and your question will be answered  Yes all these bravehouses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic Pacific andIndian oceans  One and all they were harpooned and dragged uphither from the bottom of the sea  Can Herr Alexander perform a featlike thatIn New Bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to theirdaughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apieceYou must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding for theysay they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every nightrecklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candlesIn summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine mapleslongavenues of green and gold  And in August high in air the beautifuland bountiful horsechestnuts candelabrawise proffer the passerbytheir tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms  So omnipotentis art which in many a district of New Bedford has superinducedbright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown asideat creations final dayAnd the women of New Bedford they bloom like their own red rosesBut roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of theircheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens  Elsewherematch that bloom of theirs ye cannot save in Salem where they tellme the young girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smellthem miles off shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorousMoluccas instead of the Puritanic sandsCHAPTER 7The ChapelIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whalemans Chapel and feware the moody fishermen shortly bound for the Indian Ocean orPacific who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot  I am sure thatI did notReturning from my first morning stroll I again sallied out upon thisspecial errand  The sky had changed from clear sunny cold todriving sleet and mist  Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of thecloth called bearskin I fought my way against the stubborn stormEntering I found a small scattered congregation of sailors andsailors wives and widows  A muffled silence reigned only broken attimes by the shrieks of the storm  Each silent worshipper seemedpurposely sitting apart from the other as if each silent grief wereinsular and incommunicable  The chaplain had not yet arrived andthere these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeingseveral marble tablets with black borders masoned into the wall oneither side the pulpit  Three of them ran something like thefollowing but I do not pretend to quoteSACREDTO THE MEMORYOFJOHN

1833THIS TABLETIs erected to his MemoryBYHIS WIDOWShaking off the sleet from my iceglazed hat and jacket I seatedmyself near the door and turning sideways was surprised to seeQueequeg near me  Affected by the solemnity of the scene there wasa wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance  Thissavage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrancebecause he was the only one who could not read and therefore wasnot reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall  Whether any ofthe relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now amongthe congregation I knew not but so many are the unrecordedaccidents in the fishery and so plainly did several women presentwear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing griefthat I feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whoseunhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympatheticallycaused the old wounds to bleed afreshOh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standingamong flowers can sayhere HERE lies my beloved ye know not thedesolation that broods in bosoms like these  What bitter blanks inthose blackbordered marbles which cover no ashes  What despair

even from thesedead doubts she gathers her most vital hopeIt needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of aNantucket voyage I regarded those marble tablets and by the murkylight of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen whohad gone before me  Yes Ishmael the same fate may be thine  Butsomehow I grew merry again  Delightful inducements to embark finechance for

therefore threecheers for Nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when theywill for stave my soul Jove himself cannotCHAPTER 8The PulpitI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerablerobustness entered immediately as the stormpelted door flew backupon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all thecongregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man was thechaplain  Yes it was the famous Father Mapple so called by thewhalemen among whom he was a very great favourite  He had been asailor and a harpooneer in his youth but for many years past haddedicated his life to the ministry  At the time I now write ofFather Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sortof old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth foramong all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone certain mildgleams of a newly developing bloomthe spring verdure peeping fortheven beneath Februarys snow  No one having previously heard hishistory could for the first time behold Father Mapple without theutmost interest because there were certain engrafted clericalpeculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime lifehe had led  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrellaand certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat randown with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemedalmost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it hadabsorbed  However hat and coat and overshoes were one by oneremoved and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner whenarrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpitLike most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since aregular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with thefloor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel thearchitect it seemed had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple andfinished the pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicularside ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at seaThe wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsomepair of red worsted manropes for this ladder which being itselfnicely headed and stained with a mahogany colour the wholecontrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed by nomeans in bad taste  Halting for an instant at the foot of theladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of themanropes Father Mapple cast a look upwards and then with a trulysailorlike but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mountedthe steps as if ascending the maintop of his vesselThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the casewith swinging ones were of clothcovered rope only the rounds wereof wood so that at every step there was a joint  At my firstglimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenientfor a ship these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessaryFor I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the heightslowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag upthe ladder step by step till the whole was deposited within leavinghim impregnable in his little QuebecI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for thisFather Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity andsanctity that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by anymere tricks of the stage  No thought I there must be some soberreason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize somethingunseen  Can it be then that by that act of physical isolation hesignifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outwardworldly ties and connexions  Yes for replenished with the meat andwine of the word to the faithful man of God this pulpit I see isa selfcontaining strongholda lofty Ehrenbreitstein with aperennial well of water within the wallsBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the placeborrowed from the chaplains former seafarings  Between the marblecenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed itsback was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant shipbeating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks andsnowy breakers  But high above the flying scud and darkrollingclouds there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamedforth an angels face and this bright face shed a distinct spot ofradiance upon the ships tossed deck something like that silverplate now inserted into the Victorys plank where Nelson fell  Ahnoble ship the angel seemed to say beat on beat on thou nobleship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through theclouds are rolling offserenest azure is at handNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seataste thathad achieved the ladder and the picture  Its panelled front was inthe likeness of a ships bluff bows and the Holy Bible rested on aprojecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a shipsfiddleheaded beakWhat could be more full of meaningfor the pulpit is ever thisearths foremost part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpitleads the world  From thence it is the storm of Gods quick wrath isfirst descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt  Fromthence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked forfavourable winds  Yes the worlds a ship on its passage out and nota voyage complete and the pulpit is its prowCHAPTER 9The SermonFather Mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming authorityordered the scattered people to condense  Starboard gangwaythere side away to larboardlarboard gangway to starboardMidships midshipsThere was a low rumbling of heavy seaboots among the benches and astill slighter shuffling of womens shoes and all was quiet againand every eye on the preacherHe paused a little then kneeling in the pulpits bows folded hislarge brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes andoffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and prayingat the bottom of the seaThis ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling ofa bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fogin such tones hecommenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towardsthe concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation andjoyThe ribs and terrors in the whaleArched over me a dismal gloomWhile all Gods sunlit waves rolled byAnd lift me deepening down to doomI saw the opening maw of hellWith endless pains and sorrows thereWhich none but they that feel can tellOh I was plunging to despairIn black distress I called my GodWhen I could scarce believe him mineHe bowed his ear to my complaintsNo more the whale did me confineWith speed he flew to my reliefAs on a radiant dolphin borneAwful yet bright as lightning shoneThe face of my Deliverer GodMy song for ever shall recordThat terrible that joyful hourI give the glory to my GodHis all the mercy and the powerNearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above thehowling of the storm  A brief pause ensued the preacher slowlyturned over the leaves of the Bible and at last folding his handdown upon the proper page said Beloved shipmates clinch the lastverse of the first chapter of JonahAnd God had prepared a greatfish to swallow up JonahShipmates this book containing only four chaptersfour yarnsisone of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the ScripturesYet what depths of the soul does Jonahs deep sealine sound what apregnant lesson to us is this prophet  What a noble thing is thatcanticle in the fishs belly  How billowlike and boisterouslygrand  We feel the floods surging over us we sound with him to thekelpy bottom of the waters seaweed and all the slime of the sea isabout us  But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teachesShipmates it is a twostranded lesson a lesson to us all as sinfulmen and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God  As sinful menit is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sinhardheartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift punishmentrepentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of JonahAs with all sinners among men the sin of this son of Amittai was inhis wilful disobedience of the command of Godnever mind now whatthat command was or how conveyedwhich he found a hard commandBut all the things that God would have us do are hard for us todoremember thatand hence he oftener commands us than endeavorsto persuade  And if we obey God we must disobey ourselves and itis in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying GodconsistsWith this sin of disobedience in him Jonah still further flouts atGod by seeking to flee from Him  He thinks that a ship made by menwill carry him into countries where God does not reign but only theCaptains of this earth  He skulks about the wharves of Joppa andseeks a ship thats bound for Tarshish  There lurks perhaps ahitherto unheeded meaning here  By all accounts Tarshish could havebeen no other city than the modern Cadiz  Thats the opinion oflearned men  And where is Cadiz shipmates  Cadiz is in Spain asfar by water from Joppa as Jonah could possibly have sailed inthose ancient days when the Atlantic was an almost unknown seaBecause Joppa the modern Jaffa shipmates is on the most easterlycoast of the Mediterranean the Syrian and Tarshish or Cadiz morethan two thousand miles to the westward from that just outside theStraits of Gibraltar  See ye not then shipmates that Jonah soughtto flee worldwide from God  Miserable man  Oh most contemptibleand worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulkingfrom his God prowling among the shipping like a vile burglarhastening to cross the seas  So disordered selfcondemning is hislook that had there been policemen in those days Jonah on the meresuspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched adeck  How plainly hes a fugitive no baggage not a hatboxvalise or carpetbagno friends accompany him to the wharf withtheir adieux  At last after much dodging search he finds theTarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he stepson board to see its Captain in the cabin all the sailors for themoment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the strangers evileye  Jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease andconfidence in vain essays his wretched smile  Strong intuitions ofthe man assure the mariners he can be no innocent  In their gamesomebut still serious way one whispers to the otherJack hes robbeda widow or Joe do you mark him hes a bigamist or Harrylad I guess hes the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah orbelike one of the missing murderers from Sodom  Another runs toread the bill thats stuck against the spile upon the wharf to whichthe ship is moored offering five hundred gold coins for theapprehension of a parricide and containing a description of hisperson  He reads and looks from Jonah to the bill while all hissympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah prepared to lay theirhands upon him  Frighted Jonah trembles and summoning all hisboldness to his face only looks so much the more a coward  He willnot confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicionSo he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him not to bethe man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends intothe cabinWhos there cries the Captain at his busy desk hurriedly makingout his papers for the CustomsWhos there  Oh how that harmlessquestion mangles Jonah  For the instant he almost turns to fleeagain  But he rallies  I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshishhow soon sail ye sir  Thus far the busy Captain had not looked upto Jonah though the man now stands before him but no sooner does hehear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance  Wesail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered stillintently eyeing him  No sooner sirSoon enough for any honestman that goes a passenger  Ha  Jonah thats another stab  But heswiftly calls away the Captain from that scent  Ill sail withyehe saysthe passage money how much is thatIll pay nowFor it is particularly written shipmates as if it were a thing notto be overlooked in this history that he paid the fare thereof erethe craft did sail  And taken with the context this is full ofmeaningNow Jonahs Captain shipmates was one whose discernment detectscrime in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the pennilessIn this world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freelyand without a passport whereas Virtue if a pauper is stopped atall frontiers  So Jonahs Captain prepares to test the length ofJonahs purse ere he judge him openly  He charges him thrice theusual sum and its assented to  Then the Captain knows that Jonahis a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight thatpaves its rear with gold  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purseprudent suspicions still molest the Captain  He rings every coin tofind a counterfeit  Not a forger any way he mutters and Jonah isput down for his passage  Point out my stateroom Sir says Jonahnow Im travelweary I need sleep  Thou lookest like it saysthe Captain theres thy room  Jonah enters and would lock thedoor but the lock contains no key  Hearing him foolishly fumblingthere the Captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters somethingabout the doors of convicts cells being never allowed to be lockedwithin  All dressed and dusty as he is Jonah throws himself intohis berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost resting onhis forehead  The air is close and Jonah gasps  Then in thatcontracted hole sunk too beneath the ships waterline Jonahfeels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when thewhale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wardsScrewed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightlyoscillates in Jonahs room and the ship heeling over towards thewharf with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame andall though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquitywith reference to the room though in truth infallibly straightitself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which ithung  The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah as lying in his berth histormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successfulfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance  But thatcontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him  The floor theceiling and the side are all awry  Oh so my conscience hangs inme he groans straight upwards so it burns but the chambers ofmy soul are all in crookednessLike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed stillreeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings ofthe Roman racehorse but so much the more strike his steel tags intohim as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns ingiddy anguish praying God for annihilation until the fit be passedand at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals overhim as over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is thewound and theres naught to staunch it so after sore wrestlings inhis berth Jonahs prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowningdown to sleepAnd now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cablesand from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish allcareening glides to sea  That ship my friends was the first ofrecorded smugglers the contraband was Jonah  But the sea rebels hewill not bear the wicked burden  A dreadful storm comes on theship is like to break  But now when the boatswain calls all hands tolighten her when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboardwhen the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plankthunders with trampling feet right over Jonahs head in all thisraging tumult Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep  He sees no black skyand raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he orheeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with openmouth is cleaving the seas after him  Aye shipmates Jonah was gonedown into the sides of the shipa berth in the cabin as I have takenit and was fast asleep  But the frightened master comes to him andshrieks in his dead ear What meanest thou O sleeper ariseStartled from his lethargy by that direful cry Jonah staggers to hisfeet and stumbling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out uponthe sea  But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billowleaping over the bulwarks  Wave after wave thus leaps into the shipand finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till themariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat  And ever as thewhite moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in theblackness overhead aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointinghigh upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deepTerrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul  In all hiscringing attitudes the Godfugitive is now too plainly known  Thesailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of himand at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matterto high Heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whosecause this great tempest was upon them  The lot is Jonahs thatdiscovered then how furiously they mob him with their questionsWhat is thine occupation  Whence comest thou  Thy country  Whatpeople  But mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor Jonah  Theeager mariners but ask him who he is and where from whereas theynot only receive an answer to those questions but likewise anotheranswer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer isforced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon himI am a Hebrew he criesand thenI fear the Lord the God ofHeaven who hath made the sea and the dry land  Fear him O JonahAye well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN  Straightway he nowgoes on to make a full confession whereupon the mariners became moreand more appalled but still are pitiful  For when Jonah not yetsupplicating God for mercy since he but too well knew the darknessof his desertswhen wretched Jonah cries out to them to take himand cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for HIS sake thisgreat tempest was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seekby other means to save the ship  But all in vain the indignant galehowls louder then with one hand raised invokingly to God with theother they not unreluctantly lay hold of JonahAnd now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the seawhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the seais still as Jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smoothwater behind  He goes down in the whirling heart of such amasterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he dropsseething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootstoall his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison  ThenJonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fishs belly  But observe hisprayer and learn a weighty lesson  For sinful as he is Jonah doesnot weep and wail for direct deliverance  He feels that his dreadfulpunishment is just  He leaves all his deliverance to God contentinghimself with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he willstill look towards His holy temple  And here shipmates is true andfaithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful forpunishment  And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah isshown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whaleShipmates I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sinbut I do place him before you as a model for repentance  Sin notbut if you do take heed to repent of it like JonahWhile he was speaking these words the howling of the shriekingslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher whowhen describing Jonahs seastorm seemed tossed by a storm himselfHis deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemedthe warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away fromoff his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made allhis simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange tothemThere now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over theleaves of the Book once more and at last standing motionless withclosed eyes for the moment seemed communing with God and himselfBut again he leaned over towards the people and bowing his headlowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spakethese wordsShipmates God has laid but one hand upon you both his hands pressupon me  I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lessonthat Jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and stillmore to me for I am a greater sinner than ye  And now how gladlywould I come down from this masthead and sit on the hatches therewhere you sit and listen as you listen while some one of you readsME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME as apilot of the living God  How being an anointed pilotprophet orspeaker of true things and bidden by the Lord to sound thoseunwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh Jonah appalled atthe hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought toescape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa  But God iseverywhere Tarshish he never reached  As we have seen God cameupon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs ofdoom and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of theseas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms downand the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the watery worldof woe bowled over him  Yet even then beyond the reach of anyplummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whale grounded upon theoceans utmost bones even then God heard the engulphed repentingprophet when he cried  Then God spake unto the fish and from theshuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching uptowards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air andearth and vomited out Jonah upon the dry land when the word ofthe Lord came a second time and Jonah bruised and beatenhis earslike two seashells still multitudinously murmuring of theoceanJonah did the Almightys bidding  And what was thatshipmates  To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood  That wasitThis shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot ofthe living God who slights it  Woe to him whom this world charmsfrom Gospel duty  Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waterswhen God has brewed them into a gale  Woe to him who seeks to pleaserather than to appal  Woe to him whose good name is more to him thangoodness  Woe to him who in this world courts not dishonour  Woeto him who would not be true even though to be false were salvationYea woe to him who as the great Pilot Paul has it while preachingto others is himself a castawayHe dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting hisface to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried outwith a heavenly enthusiasmBut oh shipmates on the starboardhand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top ofthat delight than the bottom of the woe is deep  Is not themaintruck higher than the kelson is low  Delight is to hima farfar upward and inward delightwho against the proud gods andcommodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable selfDelight is to him whose strong arms yet support him when the ship ofthis base treacherous world has gone down beneath him  Delight is tohim who gives no quarter in the truth and kills burns anddestroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes ofSenators and Judges  Delighttopgallant delight is to him whoacknowledges no law or lord but the Lord his God and is only apatriot to heaven  Delight is to him whom all the waves of thebillows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from thissure Keel of the Ages  And eternal delight and deliciousness will behis who coming to lay him down can say with his final breathOFatherchiefly known to me by Thy rodmortal or immortal here Idie  I have striven to be Thine more than to be this worlds ormine own  Yet this is nothing I leave eternity to Thee for whatis man that he should live out the lifetime of his GodHe said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his facewith his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people haddeparted and he was left alone in the placeCHAPTER 10A Bosom FriendReturning to the SpouterInn from the Chapel I found Queequeg therequite alone he having left the Chapel before the benediction sometime  He was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet onthe stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his facethat little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with ajackknife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming tohimself in his heathenish wayBut being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soongoing to the table took up a large book there and placing it on hislap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at everyfiftieth pageas I fanciedstopping a moment looking vacantlyaround him and giving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle ofastonishment  He would then begin again at the next fifty seemingto commence at number one each time as though he could not countmore than fifty and it was only by such a large number of fiftiesbeing found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pageswas excitedWith much interest I sat watching him  Savage though he was andhideously marred about the faceat least to my tastehiscountenance yet had a something in it which was by no meansdisagreeable  You cannot hide the soul  Through all his unearthlytattooings I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart andin his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens ofa spirit that would dare a thousand devils  And besides all thisthere was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan which even hisuncouthness could not altogether maim  He looked like a man who hadnever cringed and never had had a creditor  Whether it was toothat his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer andbrighter relief and looked more expansive than it otherwise wouldthis I will not venture to decide but certain it was his head wasphrenologically an excellent one  It may seem ridiculous but itreminded me of General Washingtons head as seen in the popularbusts of him  It had the same long regularly graded retreating slopefrom above the brows which were likewise very projecting like twolong promontories thickly wooded on top  Queequeg was GeorgeWashington cannibalistically developedWhilst I was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile tobe looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded mypresence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance butappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellousbook  Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together thenight previous and especially considering the affectionate arm I hadfound thrown over me upon waking in the morning I thought thisindifference of his very strange  But savages are strange beings attimes you do not know exactly how to take them  At first they areoverawing their calm selfcollectedness of simplicity seems aSocratic wisdom  I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted atall or but very little with the other seamen in the inn  He madeno advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge thecircle of his acquaintances  All this struck me as mighty singularyet upon second thoughts there was something almost sublime in itHere was a man some twenty thousand miles from home by the way ofCape Horn that iswhich was the only way he could get therethrownamong people as strange to him as though he were in the planetJupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving theutmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal tohimself  Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubthe had never heard there was such a thing as that  But perhaps tobe true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so livingor so striving  So soon as I hear that such or such a man giveshimself out for a philosopher I conclude that like the dyspepticold woman he must have broken his digesterAs I sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in thatmild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air itthen only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantomsgathering round the casements and peering in upon us silentsolitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells I beganto be sensible of strange feelings  I felt a melting in me  No moremy splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfishworld  This soothing savage had redeemed it  There he sat his veryindifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilizedhypocrisies and bland deceits  Wild he was a very sight of sightsto see yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards himAnd those same things that would have repelled most others they werethe very magnets that thus drew me  Ill try a pagan friend thoughtI since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy  I drewmy bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing mybest to talk with him meanwhile  At first he little noticed theseadvances but presently upon my referring to his last nightshospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to bebedfellows  I told him yes whereat I thought he looked pleasedperhaps a little complimentedWe then turned over the book together and I endeavored to explain tohim the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few picturesthat were in it  Thus I soon engaged his interest and from that wewent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights tobe seen in this famous town  Soon I proposed a social smoke andproducing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff  Andthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keepingit regularly passing between usIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagansbreast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out andleft us cronies  He seemed to take to me quite as naturally andunbiddenly as I to him and when our smoke was over he pressed hisforehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said thathenceforth we were married meaning in his countrys phrase that wewere bosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should beIn a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemedfar too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simplesavage those old rules would not applyAfter supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our roomtogether  He made me a present of his embalmed head took out hisenormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out somethirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table andmechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one ofthem towards me and said it was mine  I was going to remonstratebut he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets  I letthem stay  He then went about his evening prayers took out hisidol and removed the paper fireboard  By certain signs andsymptoms I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but wellknowing what was to follow I deliberated a moment whether in casehe invited me I would comply or otherwiseI was a good Christian born and bred in the bosom of the infalliblePresbyterian Church  How then could I unite with this wild idolatorin worshipping his piece of wood  But what is worship thought IDo you suppose now Ishmael that the magnanimous God of heaven andearthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of aninsignificant bit of black wood  Impossible  But what isworshipto do the will of GodTHAT is worship  And what is thewill of Godto do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow manto do to meTHAT is the will of God  Now Queequeg is my fellowman  And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me  Whyunite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worshipConsequently I must then unite with him in his ergo I must turnidolator  So I kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocentlittle idol offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg salamed beforehim twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed andwent to bed at peace with our own consciences and all the worldBut we did not go to sleep without some little chatHow it is I know not but there is no place like a bed forconfidential disclosures between friends  Man and wife they saythere open the very bottom of their souls to each other and some oldcouples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning  Thusthen in our hearts honeymoon lay I and Queequega cosy lovingpairCHAPTER 11NightgownWe had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals andQueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legsover mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and freeand easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulationswhat little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and wefelt like getting up again though daybreak was yet some way downthe futureYes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent positionbegan to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselvessitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against theheadboard with our four knees drawn up close together and our twonoses bending over them as if our kneepans were warmingpans  Wefelt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out ofdoors indeed out of bedclothes too seeing that there was no firein the room  The more so I say because truly to enjoy bodilywarmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no qualityin this world that is not what it is merely by contrast  Nothingexists in itself  If you flatter yourself that you are all overcomfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot be said tobe comfortable any more  But if like Queequeg and me in the bedthe tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilledwhy then indeed in the general consciousness you feel mostdelightfully and unmistakably warm  For this reason a sleepingapartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of theluxurious discomforts of the rich  For the height of this sort ofdeliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you andyour snugness and the cold of the outer air  Then there you lie likethe one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystalWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when allat once I thought I would open my eyes for when between sheetswhether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake I have a wayof always keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate thesnugness of being in bed  Because no man can ever feel his ownidentity aright except his eyes be closed as if darkness wereindeed the proper element of our essences though light be morecongenial to our clayey part  Upon opening my eyes then and comingout of my own pleasant and selfcreated darkness into the imposed andcoarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelveoclockatnight Iexperienced a disagreeable revulsion  Nor did I at all object to thehint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a lightseeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strongdesire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk  Be it said thatthough I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bedthe night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow whenlove once comes to bend them  For now I liked nothing better thanto have Queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to befull of such serene household joy then  I no more felt undulyconcerned for the landlords policy of insurance  I was only aliveto the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and ablanket with a real friend  With our shaggy jackets drawn about ourshoulders we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other tillslowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminatedby the flame of the newlit lampWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away tofar distant scenes I know not but he now spoke of his nativeisland and eager to hear his history I begged him to go on andtell it  He gladly complied  Though at the time I but illcomprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures whenI had become more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable meto present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeletonI giveCHAPTER 12BiographicalQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko an island far away to the Westand South  It is not down in any map true places never areWhen a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands ina grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a greensapling even then in Queequegs ambitious soul lurked a strongdesire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler ortwo  His father was a High Chief a King his uncle a High Priestand on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives ofunconquerable warriors  There was excellent blood in hisveinsroyal stuff though sadly vitiated I fear by the cannibalpropensity he nourished in his untutored youthA Sag Harbor ship visited his fathers bay and Queequeg sought apassage to Christian lands  But the ship having her full complementof seamen spurned his suit and not all the King his fathersinfluence could prevail  But Queequeg vowed a vow  Alone in hiscanoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the shipmust pass through when she quitted the island  On one side was acoral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrovethickets that grew out into the water  Hiding his canoe stillafloat among these thickets with its prow seaward he sat down inthe stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding by likea flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of hisfoot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwinghimself at full length upon the deck grappled a ringbolt there andswore not to let it go though hacked in piecesIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended acutlass over his naked wrists Queequeg was the son of a King andQueequeg budged not  Struck by his desperate dauntlessness and hiswild desire to visit Christendom the captain at last relented andtold him he might make himself at home  But this fine youngsavagethis sea Prince of Wales never saw the Captains cabinThey put him down among the sailors and made a whaleman of him  Butlike Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign citiesQueequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happilygain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen  For atbottomso he told mehe was actuated by a profound desire to learnamong the Christians the arts whereby to make his people stillhappier than they were and more than that still better than theywere  But alas the practices of whalemen soon convinced him thateven Christians could be both miserable and wicked infinitely moreso than all his fathers heathens  Arrived at last in old SagHarbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on toNantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place alsopoor Queequeg gave it up for lost  Thought he its a wicked worldin all meridians Ill die a paganAnd thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among theseChristians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gibberishHence the queer ways about him though now some time from homeBy hints I asked him whether he did not propose going back andhaving a coronation since he might now consider his father dead andgone he being very old and feeble at the last accounts  He answeredno not yet and added that he was fearful Christianity or ratherChristians had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiledthrone of thirty pagan Kings before him  But by and by he said hewould returnas soon as he felt himself baptized again  For thenonce however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oats inall four oceans  They had made a harpooneer of him and that barbediron was in lieu of a sceptre nowI asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his futuremovements  He answered to go to sea again in his old vocationUpon this I told him that whaling was my own design and informedhim of my intention to sail out of Nantucket as being the mostpromising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from  He atonce resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the samevessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess withme in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldlydip into the Potluck of both worlds  To all this I joyouslyassented for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg he wasan experienced harpooneer and as such could not fail to be of greatusefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant of the mysteriesof whaling though well acquainted with the sea as known to merchantseamenHis story being ended with his pipes last dying puff Queequegembraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out thelight we rolled over from each other this way and that and verysoon were sleepingCHAPTER 13WheelbarrowNext morning Monday after disposing of the embalmed head to abarber for a block I settled my own and comrades bill usinghowever my comrades money  The grinning landlord as well as theboarders seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which hadsprung up between me and Queequegespecially as Peter Coffins cockand bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed meconcerning the very person whom I now companied withWe borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my ownpoor carpetbag and Queequegs canvas sack and hammock away we wentdown to the Moss the little Nantucket packet schooner moored atthe wharf  As we were going along the people stared not at Queequegso muchfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in theirstreetsbut at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms  Butwe heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns andQueequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoonbarbs  I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with himashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their ownharpoons  To this in substance he replied that though what Ihinted was true enough yet he had a particular affection for his ownharpoon because it was of assured stuff well tried in many a mortalcombat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales  In shortlike many inland reapers and mowers who go into the farmers meadowsarmed with their own scythesthough in no wise obliged to furnishthemeven so Queequeg for his own private reasons preferred hisown harpoonShifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny storyabout the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen  It was in Sag HarborThe owners of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carryhis heavy chest to his boarding house  Not to seem ignorant aboutthe thingthough in truth he was entirely so concerning the preciseway in which to manage the barrowQueequeg puts his chest upon itlashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up thewharf  Why said I Queequeg you might have known better thanthat one would think  Didnt the people laughUpon this he told me another story  The people of his island ofRokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrantwater of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like apunchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornamenton the braided mat where the feast is held  Now a certain grandmerchant ship once touched at Rokovoko and its commanderfrom allaccounts a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a seacaptainthis commander was invited to the wedding feast ofQueequegs sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten  Wellwhen all the wedding guests were assembled at the brides bamboocottage this Captain marches in and being assigned the post ofhonour placed himself over against the punchbowl and between theHigh Priest and his majesty the King Queequegs father  Grace beingsaidfor those people have their grace as well as wethoughQueequeg told me that unlike us who at such times look downwards toour platters they on the contrary copying the ducks glanceupwards to the great Giver of all feastsGrace I say being saidthe High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of theisland that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingersinto the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates  Seeing himselfplaced next the Priest and noting the ceremony and thinkinghimselfbeing Captain of a shipas having plain precedence over amere island King especially in the Kings own housethe Captaincoolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowltaking it Isuppose for a huge fingerglass  Now said Queequeg what youtink nowDidnt our people laughAt last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board theschooner  Hoisting sail it glided down the Acushnet river  On oneside New Bedford rose in terraces of streets their icecoveredtrees all glittering in the clear cold air  Huge hills andmountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side byside the worldwandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored atlast while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers withblended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch all betokeningthat new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and longvoyage ended only begins a second and a second ended only begins athird and so on for ever and for aye  Such is the endlessnessyea the intolerableness of all earthly effortGaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh thelittle Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt hissnortings  How I snuffed that Tartar airhow I spurned thatturnpike earththat common highway all over dented with the marksof slavish heels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimityof the sea which will permit no recordsAt the same foamfountain Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with meHis dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointedteeth  On on we flew and our offing gained the Moss did homage tothe blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the SultanSideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like awire the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in landtornadoes  So full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by theplunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeeringglances of the passengers a lubberlike assembly who marvelled thattwo fellow beings should be so companionable as though a white manwere anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro  But therewere some boobies and bumpkins there who by their intensegreenness must have come from the heart and centre of all verdureQueequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind hisback  I thought the bumpkins hour of doom was come  Dropping hisharpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almostmiraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into theair then slightly tapping his stern in midsomerset the fellowlanded with bursting lungs upon his feet while Queequeg turning hisback upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for apuffCapting  Capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officerCapting Capting heres the devilHallo YOU sir cried the Captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalkingup to Queequeg what in thunder do you mean by that  Dont you knowyou might have killed that chapWhat him say said Queequeg as he mildly turned to meHe say said I that you came near kille that man therepointing to the still shivering greenhornKille cried Queequeg twisting his tattooed face into anunearthly expression of disdain ah him bevy smalle fisheQueequeg no kille so smalle fishe Queequeg kille big whaleLook you roared the Captain Ill kille YOU you cannibal ifyou try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eyeBut it so happened just then that it was high time for the Captainto mind his own eye  The prodigious strain upon the mainsail hadparted the weathersheet and the tremendous boom was now flying fromside to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deckThe poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly was sweptoverboard all hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at theboom to stay it seemed madness  It flew from right to left andback again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instantseemed on the point of snapping into splinters  Nothing was doneand nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushedtowards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lowerjaw of an exasperated whale  In the midst of this consternationQueequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path ofthe boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarksand then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom asit swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that waytrapped and all was safe  The schooner was run into the wind andwhile the hands were clearing away the stern boat Queequeg strippedto the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leapFor three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog throwinghis long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing hisbrawny shoulders through the freezing foam  I looked at the grandand glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved  The greenhorn hadgone down  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the waterQueequeg now took an instants glance around him and seeming to seejust how matters were dived down and disappeared  A few minutesmore and he rose again one arm still striking out and with theother dragging a lifeless form  The boat soon picked them up  Thepoor bumpkin was restored  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trumpthe captain begged his pardon  From that hour I clove to Queequeglike a barnacle yea till poor Queequeg took his last long diveWas there ever such unconsciousness  He did not seem to think thathe at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous SocietiesHe only asked for waterfresh watersomething to wipe the brineoff that done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaningagainst the bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed tobe saying to himselfIts a mutual jointstock world in allmeridians  We cannibals must help these ChristiansCHAPTER 14NantucketNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning so aftera fine run we safely arrived in NantucketNantucket  Take out your map and look at it  See what a real cornerof the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore morelonely than the Eddystone lighthouse  Look at ita mere hillockand elbow of sand all beach without a background  There is moresand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute forblotting paper  Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have toplant weeds there they dont grow naturally that they import Canadathistles that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop aleak in an oil cask that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carriedabout like bits of the true cross in Rome that people there planttoadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summertime that one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a dayswalk a prairie that they wear quicksand shoes something likeLaplander snowshoes that they are so shut up belted about everyway inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the oceanthat to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes befound adhering as to the backs of sea turtles  But theseextravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no IllinoisLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island wassettled by the redmen  Thus goes the legend  In olden times aneagle swooped down upon the New England coast and carried off aninfant Indian in his talons  With loud lament the parents saw theirchild borne out of sight over the wide waters  They resolved tofollow in the same direction  Setting out in their canoes after aperilous passage they discovered the island and there they found anempty ivory casketthe poor little Indians skeletonWhat wonder then that these Nantucketers born on a beach shouldtake to the sea for a livelihood  They first caught crabs andquohogs in the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets formackerel more experienced they pushed off in boats and capturedcod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the seaexplored this watery world put an incessant belt ofcircumnavigations round it peeped in at Behrings Straits and inall seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with themightiest animated mass that has survived the flood most monstrousand most mountainous  That Himmalehan saltsea Mastodon clothedwith such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panicsare more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaultsAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers these sea hermits issuingfrom their anthill in the sea overrun and conquered the wateryworld like so many Alexanders parcelling out among them theAtlantic Pacific and Indian oceans as the three pirate powers didPoland  Let America add Mexico to Texas and pile Cuba upon Canadalet the English overswarm all India and hang out their blazingbanner from the sun two thirds of this terraqueous globe are theNantucketers  For the sea is his he owns it as Emperors ownempires other seamen having but a right of way through it  Merchantships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts evenpirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen theroad they but plunder other ships other fragments of the land likethemselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomlessdeep itself  The Nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the seahe alone in Bible language goes down to it in ships to and froploughing it as his own special plantation  THERE is his home THERElies his business which a Noahs flood would not interrupt thoughit overwhelmed all the millions in China  He lives on the sea asprairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbsthem as chamois hunters climb the Alps  For years he knows not theland so that when he comes to it at last it smells like anotherworld more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman  With thelandless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleepbetween billows so at nightfall the Nantucketer out of sight ofland furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his verypillow rush herds of walruses and whalesCHAPTER 15ChowderIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly toanchor and Queequeg and I went ashore so we could attend to nobusiness that day at least none but a supper and a bed  Thelandlord of the SpouterInn had recommended us to his cousin HoseaHussey of the Try Pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of oneof the best kept hotels in all Nantucket and moreover he had assuredus that Cousin Hosea as he called him was famous for his chowdersIn short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better thantry potluck at the Try Pots  But the directions he had given usabout keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we openeda white church to the larboard and then keeping that on the larboardhand till we made a corner three points to the starboard and thatdone then ask the first man we met where the place was thesecrooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first especiallyas at the outset Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouseourfirst point of departuremust be left on the larboard hand whereasI had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboardHowever by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now andthen knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we atlast came to something which there was no mistakingTwo enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses earsswung from the crosstrees of an old topmast planted in front of anold doorway  The horns of the crosstrees were sawed off on theother side so that this old topmast looked not a little like agallows  Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at thetime but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vaguemisgiving  A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the tworemaining horns yes TWO of them one for Queequeg and one for meIts ominous thinks I  A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in myfirst whaling port tombstones staring at me in the whalemenschapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pots tooAre these last throwing out oblique hints touching TophetI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled womanwith yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the innunder a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like aninjured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purplewoollen shirtGet along with ye said she to the man or Ill be combing yeCome on Queequeg said I all right  Theres Mrs HusseyAnd so it turned out Mr Hosea Hussey being from home but leavingMrs Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs  Uponmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed Mrs Husseypostponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a littleroom and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recentlyconcluded repast turned round to us and saidClam or CodWhats that about Cods maam said I with much politenessClam or Cod she repeatedA clam for supper a cold clam is THAT what you mean Mrs Husseysays I but thats a rather cold and clammy reception in the wintertime aint it Mrs HusseyBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purpleShirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hearnothing but the word clam Mrs Hussey hurried towards an open doorleading to the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappearedQueequeg said I do you think that we can make out a supper forus both on one clamHowever a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie theapparently cheerless prospect before us  But when that smokingchowder came in the mystery was delightfully explained  Oh sweetfriends hearken to me  It was made of small juicy clams scarcelybigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and saltedpork cut up into little flakes the whole enriched with butter andplentifully seasoned with pepper and salt  Our appetites beingsharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular Queequeg seeinghis favourite fishing food before him and the chowder beingsurpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition whenleaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs Husseys clam and codannouncement I thought I would try a little experiment  Stepping tothe kitchen door I uttered the word cod with great emphasis andresumed my seat  In a few moments the savoury steam came forthagain but with a different flavor and in good time a finecodchowder was placed before usWe resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinksI to myself I wonder now if this here has any effect on the headWhats that stultifying saying about chowderheaded people  Butlook Queequeg aint that a live eel in your bowl  Wheres yourharpoonFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots which well deservedits name for the pots there were always boiling chowders  Chowderfor breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper tillyou began to look for fishbones coming through your clothes  Thearea before the house was paved with clamshells  Mrs Hussey wore apolished necklace of codfish vertebra and Hosea Hussey had hisaccount books bound in superior old sharkskin  There was a fishyflavor to the milk too which I could not at all account for tillone morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among somefishermens boats I saw Hoseas brindled cow feeding on fishremnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a codsdecapitated head looking very slipshod I assure yeSupper concluded we received a lamp and directions from Mrs Husseyconcerning the nearest way to bed but as Queequeg was about toprecede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm anddemanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers  Whynot said I every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut whynot  Because its dangerous says she  Ever since young Stiggscoming from that unfortnt vyge of his when he was gone four yearsand a half with only three barrels of ILE was found dead in myfirst floor back with his harpoon in his side ever since then Iallow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms atnight  So Mr Queequeg for she had learned his name I willjust take this here iron and keep it for you till morning  But thechowder clam or cod tomorrow for breakfast menBoth says I and lets have a couple of smoked herring by way ofvarietyCHAPTER 16The ShipIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow  But to my surprise andno small concern Queequeg now gave me to understand that he hadbeen diligently consulting Yojothe name of his black littlegodand Yojo had told him two or three times over and stronglyinsisted upon it everyway that instead of our going together amongthe whalingfleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craftinstead of this I say Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection ofthe ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch as Yojo purposedbefriending us and in order to do so had already pitched upon avessel which if left to myself I Ishmael should infallibly lightupon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and inthat vessel I must immediately ship myself for the presentirrespective of QueequegI have forgotten to mention that in many things Queequeg placedgreat confidence in the excellence of Yojos judgment and surprisingforecast of things and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem as arather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon thewhole but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designsNow this plan of Queequegs or rather Yojos touching theselection of our craft I did not like that plan at all  I had not alittle relied upon Queequegs sagacity to point out the whaler bestfitted to carry us and our fortunes securely  But as all myremonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg I was obliged toacquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with adetermined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quicklysettle that trifling little affair  Next morning early leavingQueequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroomfor it seemed thatit was some sort of Lent or Ramadan or day of fasting humiliationand prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day HOW it was I never couldfind out for though I applied myself to it several times I nevercould master his liturgies and XXXIX Articlesleaving Queequegthen fasting on his tomahawk pipe and Yojo warming himself at hissacrificial fire of shavings I sallied out among the shippingAfter much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries I learntthat there were three ships up for threeyears voyagesTheDevildam the Titbit and the Pequod  DEVILDAM I do not knowthe origin of TITBIT is obvious PEQUOD you will no doubtremember was the name of a celebrated tribe of MassachusettsIndians now extinct as the ancient Medes  I peered and pryed aboutthe Devildam from her hopped over to the Titbit and finallygoing on board the Pequod looked around her for a moment and thendecided that this was the very ship for usYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught Iknowsquaretoed luggers mountainous Japanese junks butterboxgalliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such arare old craft as this same rare old Pequod  She was a ship of theold school rather small if anything with an oldfashionedclawfooted look about her  Long seasoned and weatherstained in thetyphoons and calms of all four oceans her old hulls complexion wasdarkened like a French grenadiers who has alike fought in Egypt andSiberia  Her venerable bows looked bearded  Her mastscutsomewhere on the coast of Japan where her original ones were lostoverboard in a galeher masts stood stiffly up like the spines ofthe three old kings of Cologne  Her ancient decks were worn andwrinkled like the pilgrimworshipped flagstone in CanterburyCathedral where Becket bled  But to all these her old antiquitieswere added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wildbusiness that for more than half a century she had followed  OldCaptain Peleg many years her chiefmate before he commanded anothervessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the principalowners of the Pequodthis old Peleg during the term of hischiefmateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaidit all over with a quaintness both of material and deviceunmatched by anything except it be ThorkillHakes carved buckler orbedstead  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperorhis neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory  She was a thing oftrophies  A cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in thechased bones of her enemies  All round her unpanelled openbulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharpteeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her oldhempen thews and tendons to  Those thews ran not through base blocksof land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of seaivoryScorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there atiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved from thelong narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe  The helmsman whosteered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the Tartar when heholds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw  A noble craft butsomehow a most melancholy  All noble things are touched with thatNow when I looked about the quarterdeck for some one havingauthority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyageat first I saw nobody but I could not well overlook a strange sortof tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast  Itseemed only a temporary erection used in port  It was of a conicalshape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs oflimber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jawsof the rightwhale  Planted with their broad ends on the deck acircle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards eachother and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loosehairy fibres waved to and fro like the topknot on some oldPottowottamie Sachems head  A triangular opening faced towards thebows of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete viewforwardAnd half concealed in this queer tenement I at length found one whoby his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon andthe ships work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burdenof command  He was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wrigglingall over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed ofa stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam wasconstructedThere was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearanceof the elderly man I saw he was brown and brawny like most oldseamen and heavily rolled up in blue pilotcloth cut in the Quakerstyle only there was a fine and almost microscopic network of theminutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisenfrom his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking towindwardfor this causes the muscles about the eyes to becomepursed together  Such eyewrinkles are very effectual in a scowlIs this the Captain of the Pequod said I advancing to the door ofthe tentSupposing it be the captain of the Pequod what dost thou want ofhim he demandedI was thinking of shippingThou wast wast thou  I see thou art no Nantucketerever been ina stove boatNo Sir I never haveDost know nothing at all about whaling I dare sayehNothing Sir but I have no doubt I shall soon learn  Ive beenseveral voyages in the merchant service and I think thatMerchant service be damned  Talk not that lingo to me  Dost seethat legIll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thoutalkest of the marchant service to me again  Marchant serviceindeed  I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served inthose marchant ships  But flukes man what makes thee want to go awhaling ehit looks a little suspicious dont it ehHast notbeen a pirate hast thouDidst not rob thy last Captain didstthouDost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest toseaI protested my innocence of these things  I saw that under the maskof these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulatedQuakerish Nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and ratherdistrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from Cape Cod or theVineyardBut what takes thee awhaling  I want to know that before I thinkof shipping yeWell sir I want to see what whaling is  I want to see the worldWant to see what whaling is eh  Have ye clapped eye on CaptainAhabWho is Captain Ahab sirAye aye I thought so  Captain Ahab is the Captain of this shipI am mistaken then  I thought I was speaking to the CaptainhimselfThou art speaking to Captain Pelegthats who ye are speaking toyoung man  It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequodfitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs includingcrew  We are part owners and agents  But as I was going to say ifthou wantest to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do I canput ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it pastbacking out  Clap eye on Captain Ahab young man and thou wilt findthat he has only one legWhat do you mean sir  Was the other one lost by a whaleLost by a whale  Young man come nearer to me it was devouredchewed up crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chippeda boatah ahI was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touchedat the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmlyas I could What you say is no doubt true enough sir but how couldI know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whalethough indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact ofthe accidentLook ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft dye see thoudost not talk shark a bit  SURE yeve been to sea before now sureof thatSir said I I thought I told you that I had been four voyages inthe merchantHard down out of that  Mind what I said about the marchantservicedont aggravate meI wont have it  But let us understandeach other  I have given thee a hint about what whaling is do yeyet feel inclined for itI do sirVery good  Now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a livewhales throat and then jump after it  Answer quickI am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not tobe got rid of that is which I dont take to be the factGood again  Now then thou not only wantest to go awhaling tofind out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go inorder to see the world  Was not that what ye said  I thought soWell then just step forward there and take a peep over theweatherbow and then back to me and tell me what ye see thereFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request notknowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnestBut concentrating all his crows feet into one scowl Captain Pelegstarted me on the errandGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow I perceived that theship swinging to her anchor with the floodtide was now obliquelypointing towards the open ocean  The prospect was unlimited butexceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety thatI could seeWell whats the report said Peleg when I came back what did yeseeNot much I repliednothing but water considerable horizonthough and theres a squall coming up I thinkWell what does thou think then of seeing the world  Do ye wish togo round Cape Horn to see any more of it eh  Cant ye see the worldwhere you standI was a little staggered but go awhaling I must and I would andthe Pequod was as good a ship as anyI thought the bestand allthis I now repeated to Peleg  Seeing me so determined he expressedhis willingness to ship meAnd thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he addedcomealong with ye  And so saying he led the way below deck into thecabinSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon andsurprising figure  It turned out to be Captain Bildad who alongwith Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel theother shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held bya crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancerywards each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot ofplank or a nail or two in the ship  People in Nantucket investtheir money in whaling vessels the same way that you do yours inapproved state stocks bringing in good interestNow Bildad like Peleg and indeed many other Nantucketers was aQuaker the island having been originally settled by that sect andto this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measurethe peculiarities of the Quaker only variously and anomalouslymodified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous  For some ofthese same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors andwhalehunters  They are fighting Quakers they are Quakers with avengeanceSo that there are instances among them of men who named withScripture namesa singularly common fashion on the islandand inchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou ofthe Quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundlessadventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with theseunoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character notunworthy a Scandinavian seaking or a poetical Pagan Roman  Andwhen these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural forcewith a globular brain and a ponderous heart who has also by thestillness and seclusion of many long nightwatches in the remotestwaters and beneath constellations never seen here at the north beenled to think untraditionally and independently receiving allnatures sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virginvoluntary and confiding breast and thereby chiefly but with somehelp from accidental advantages to learn a bold and nervous loftylanguagethat man makes one in a whole nations censusa mightypageant creature formed for noble tragedies  Nor will it at alldetract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or othercircumstances he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidnessat the bottom of his nature  For all men tragically great are madeso through a certain morbidness  Be sure of this O young ambitionall mortal greatness is but disease  But as yet we have not to dowith such an one but with quite another and still a man who ifindeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of theQuaker modified by individual circumstancesLike Captain Peleg Captain Bildad was a welltodo retiredwhaleman  But unlike Captain Pelegwho cared not a rush for whatare called serious things and indeed deemed those selfsame seriousthings the veriest of all triflesCaptain Bildad had not only beenoriginally educated according to the strictest sect of NantucketQuakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of manyunclad lovely island creatures round the Hornall that had notmoved this native born Quaker one single jot had not so much asaltered one angle of his vest  Still for all this immutablenesswas there some lack of common consistency about worthy CaptainPeleg  Though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear armsagainst land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded theAtlantic and Pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yethad he in his straightbodied coat spilled tuns upon tuns ofleviathan gore  How now in the contemplative evening of his daysthe pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence I donot know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probablyhe had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that amans religion is one thing and this practical world quite anotherThis world pays dividends  Rising from a little cabinboy in shortclothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shadbelliedwaistcoat from that becoming boatheader chiefmate and captainand finally a ship owner Bildad as I hinted before had concludedhis adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at thegoodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quietreceiving of his wellearned incomeNow Bildad I am sorry to say had the reputation of being anincorrigible old hunks and in his seagoing days a bitter hardtaskmaster  They told me in Nantucket though it certainly seems acurious story that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman hiscrew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to thehospital sore exhausted and worn out  For a pious man especiallyfor a Quaker he was certainly rather hardhearted to say theleast  He never used to swear though at his men they said butsomehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard workout of them  When Bildad was a chiefmate to have his drabcolouredeye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous tillyou could clutch somethinga hammer or a marlingspike and go towork like mad at something or other never mind what  Indolence andidleness perished before him  His own person was the exactembodiment of his utilitarian character  On his long gaunt body hecarried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a softeconomical nap to it like the worn nap of his broadbrimmed hatSuch then was the person that I saw seated on the transom when Ifollowed Captain Peleg down into the cabin  The space between thedecks was small and there boltupright sat old Bildad who alwayssat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails  Hisbroadbrim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed hisdrab vesture was buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose heseemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volumeBildad cried Captain Peleg at it again Bildad eh  Ye havebeen studying those Scriptures now for the last thirty years to mycertain knowledge  How far ye got BildadAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmateBildad without noticing his present irreverence quietly looked upand seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards PelegHe says hes our man Bildad said Peleg he wants to shipDost thee said Bildad in a hollow tone and turning round to meI dost said I unconsciously he was so intense a QuakerWhat do ye think of him Bildad said PelegHell do said Bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away athis book in a mumbling tone quite audibleI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw especially asPeleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer  But Isaid nothing only looking round me sharply  Peleg now threw open achest and drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and inkbefore him and seated himself at a little table  I began to thinkit was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would bewilling to engage for the voyage  I was already aware that in thewhaling business they paid no wages but all hands including thecaptain received certain shares of the profits called lays and thatthese lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertainingto the respective duties of the ships company  I was also awarethat being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be verylarge but considering that I was used to the sea could steer aship splice a rope and all that I made no doubt that from all Ihad heard I should be offered at least the 275th laythat is the275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever thatmight eventually amount to  And though the 275th lay was what theycall a rather LONG LAY yet it was better than nothing and if we hada lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wearout on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for whichI would not have to pay one stiverIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princelyfortuneand so it was a very poor way indeed  But I am one ofthose that never take on about princely fortunes and am quitecontent if the world is ready to board and lodge me while I amputting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud  Upon the whole Ithought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing but would nothave been surprised had I been offered the 200th considering I wasof a broadshouldered makeBut one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful aboutreceiving a generous share of the profits was this Ashore I hadheard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old cronyBildad how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequodtherefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered ownersleft nearly the whole management of the ships affairs to these twoAnd I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mightydeal to say about shipping hands especially as I now found him onboard the Pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading hisBible as if at his own fireside  Now while Peleg was vainly tryingto mend a pen with his jackknife old Bildad to my no smallsurprise considering that he was such an interested party in theseproceedings Bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himselfout of his book LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earthwhere mothWell Captain Bildad interrupted Peleg what dye say what layshall we give this young manThou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred andseventyseventh wouldnt be too much would itwhere moth and rustdo corrupt but LAYLAY indeed thought I and such a lay the seven hundred andseventyseventh  Well old Bildad you are determined that I forone shall not LAY up many LAYS here below where moth and rust docorrupt  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that indeed and thoughfrom the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive alandsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though sevenhundred and seventyseven is a pretty large number yet when youcome to make a TEENTH of it you will then see I say that the sevenhundred and seventyseventh part of a farthing is a good deal lessthan seven hundred and seventyseven gold doubloons and so I thoughtat the timeWhy blast your eyes Bildad cried Peleg thou dost not want toswindle this young man he must have more than thatSeven hundred and seventyseventh again said Bildad withoutlifting his eyes and then went on mumblingfor where your treasureis there will your heart be alsoI am going to put him down for the three hundredth said Peleg doye hear that Bildad  The three hundredth lay I sayBildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him saidCaptain Peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must considerthe duty thou owest to the other owners of this shipwidows andorphans many of themand that if we too abundantly reward thelabors of this young man we may be taking the bread from thosewidows and those orphans  The seven hundred and seventyseventh layCaptain PelegThou Bildad roared Peleg starting up and clattering about thecabin  Blast ye Captain Bildad if I had followed thy advice inthese matters I would afore now had a conscience to lug about thatwould be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailedround Cape HornCaptain Peleg said Bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawingten inches of water or ten fathoms I cant tell but as thou artstill an impenitent man Captain Peleg I greatly fear lest thyconscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink theefoundering down to the fiery pit Captain PelegFiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearingye insult me  Its an allfired outrage to tell any human creaturethat hes bound to hell  Flukes and flames  Bildad say that againto me and start my soulbolts but IllIllyes Ill swallow alive goat with all his hair and horns on  Out of the cabin yecanting drabcoloured son of a wooden guna straight wake with yeAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad but with amarvellous oblique sliding celerity Bildad for that time eludedhimAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal andresponsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give upall idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarilycommanded I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildadwho I made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before theawakened wrath of Peleg  But to my astonishment he sat down againon the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightestintention of withdrawing  He seemed quite used to impenitent Pelegand his ways  As for Peleg after letting off his rage as he hadthere seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lambthough he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated  Whewhe whistled at lastthe squalls gone off to leeward I thinkBildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that penwill ye  My jackknife here needs the grindstone  Thats he thankye Bildad  Now then my young man Ishmaels thy name didnt yesay  Well then down ye go here Ishmael for the three hundredthlayCaptain Peleg said I I have a friend with me who wants to shiptooshall I bring him down tomorrowTo be sure said Peleg  Fetch him along and well look at himWhat lay does he want groaned Bildad glancing up from the bookin which he had again been burying himselfOh never thee mind about that Bildad said Peleg  Has he everwhaled it any turning to meKilled more whales than I can count Captain PelegWell bring him along thenAnd after signing the papers off I went nothing doubting but thatI had done a good mornings work and that the Pequod was theidentical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me roundthe CapeBut I had not proceeded far when I began to bethink me that theCaptain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me thoughindeed in many cases a whaleship will be completely fitted outand receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himselfvisible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages areso prolonged and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly briefthat if the captain have a family or any absorbing concernment ofthat sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in portbut leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea  However itis always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committingyourself into his hands  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleginquiring where Captain Ahab was to be foundAnd what dost thou want of Captain Ahab  Its all right enoughthou art shippedYes but I should like to see himBut I dont think thou wilt be able to at present  I dont knowexactly whats the matter with him but he keeps close inside thehouse a sort of sick and yet he dont look so  In fact he aintsick but no he isnt well either  Any how young man he wontalways see me so I dont suppose he will thee  Hes a queer manCaptain Ahabso some thinkbut a good one  Oh thoult like himwell enough no fear no fear  Hes a grand ungodly godlike manCaptain Ahab doesnt speak much but when he does speak then youmay well listen  Mark ye be forewarned Ahabs above the commonAhabs been in colleges as well as mong the cannibals been used todeeper wonders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightierstranger foes than whales  His lance aye the keenest and the surestthat out of all our isle  Oh he aint Captain Bildad no and heaint Captain Peleg HES AHAB boy and Ahab of old thou knowestwas a crowned kingAnd a very vile one  When that wicked king was slain the dogs didthey not lick his bloodCome hither to mehither hither said Peleg with a significancein his eye that almost startled me  Look ye lad never say that onboard the Pequod  Never say it anywhere  Captain Ahab did not namehimself  Twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowedmother who died when he was only a twelvemonth old  And yet the oldsquaw Tistig at Gayhead said that the name would somehow proveprophetic  And perhaps other fools like her may tell thee thesame  I wish to warn thee  Its a lie  I know Captain Ahab wellIve sailed with him as mate years ago I know what he isa goodmannot a pious good man like Bildad but a swearing goodmansomething like meonly theres a good deal more of him  Ayeaye I know that he was never very jolly and I know that on thepassage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell but it wasthe sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought thatabout as any one might see  I know too that ever since he losthis leg last voyage by that accursed whale hes been a kind ofmoodydesperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all passoff  And once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young manits better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing badone  So goodbye to theeand wrong not Captain Ahab because hehappens to have a wicked name  Besides my boy he has a wifenotthree voyages weddeda sweet resigned girl  Think of that by thatsweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be anyutter hopeless harm in Ahab  No no my lad stricken blasted ifhe be Ahab has his humanitiesAs I walked away I was full of thoughtfulness what had beenincidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab filled me with a certainwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him  And somehow at thetime I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for I dont knowwhat unless it was the cruel loss of his leg  And yet I also felt astrange awe of him but that sort of awe which I cannot at alldescribe was not exactly awe I do not know what it was  But I feltit and it did not disincline me towards him though I feltimpatience at what seemed like mystery in him so imperfectly as hewas known to me then  However my thoughts were at length carried inother directions so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mindCHAPTER 17The RamadanAs Queequegs Ramadan or Fasting and Humiliation was to continueall day I did not choose to disturb him till towards nightfall forI cherish the greatest respect towards everybodys religiousobligations never mind how comical and could not find it in myheart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping atoadstool or those other creatures in certain parts of our earthwho with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planetsbow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely onaccount of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in hisnameI say we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in thesethings and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortalspagans and what not because of their halfcrazy conceits on thesesubjects  There was Queequeg now certainly entertaining the mostabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadanbut what of thatQueequeg thought he knew what he was about I suppose he seemed tobe content and there let him rest  All our arguing with him wouldnot avail let him be I say and Heaven have mercy on usallPresbyterians and Pagans alikefor we are all somehowdreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mendingTowards evening when I felt assured that all his performances andrituals must be over I went up to his room and knocked at the doorbut no answer  I tried to open it but it was fastened insideQueequeg said I softly through the keyholeall silent  I sayQueequeg why dont you speak  Its IIshmael  But all remainedstill as before  I began to grow alarmed  I had allowed him suchabundant time I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit  Ilooked through the keyhole but the door opening into an odd cornerof the room the keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinisterone  I could only see part of the footboard of the bed and a lineof the wall but nothing more  I was surprised to behold restingagainst the wall the wooden shaft of Queequegs harpoon which thelandlady the evening previous had taken from him before our mountingto the chamber  Thats strange thought I but at any rate sincethe harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad withoutit therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistakeQueequegQueequegall still  Something must have happenedApoplexy  I tried to burst open the door but it stubbornlyresisted  Running down stairs I quickly stated my suspicions to thefirst person I metthe chambermaid  La la she cried Ithought something must be the matter  I went to make the bed afterbreakfast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard andits been just so silent ever since  But I thought may be you hadboth gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping  La lamaamMistress murder  Mrs Hussey apoplexyand with thesecries she ran towards the kitchen I followingMrs Hussey soon appeared with a mustardpot in one hand and avinegarcruet in the other having just broken away from theoccupation of attending to the castors and scolding her little blackboy meantimeWoodhouse cried I which way to it  Run for Gods sake andfetch something to pry open the doorthe axethe axe hes had astroke depend upon itand so saying I was unmethodically rushingup stairs again emptyhanded when Mrs Hussey interposed themustardpot and vinegarcruet and the entire castor of hercountenanceWhats the matter with you young manGet the axe  For Gods sake run for the doctor some one while Ipry it openLook here said the landlady quickly putting down thevinegarcruet so as to have one hand free look here are youtalking about prying open any of my doorsand with that she seizedmy arm  Whats the matter with you  Whats the matter with youshipmateIn as calm but rapid a manner as possible I gave her to understandthe whole case  Unconsciously clapping the vinegarcruet to one sideof her nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimedNo  Ihavent seen it since I put it there  Running to a little closetunder the landing of the stairs she glanced in and returning toldme that Queequegs harpoon was missing  Hes killed himself shecried  Its unfortnate Stiggs done over again there goes anothercounterpaneGod pity his poor motherit will be the ruin of myhouse  Has the poor lad a sister  Wheres that girlthere Bettygo to Snarles the Painter and tell him to paint me a sign withnosuicides permitted here and no smoking in the parlormight aswell kill both birds at once  Kill  The Lord be merciful to hisghost  Whats that noise there  You young man avast thereAnd running up after me she caught me as I was again trying to forceopen the doorI dont allow it I wont have my premises spoiled  Go for thelocksmith theres one about a mile from here  But avast puttingher hand in her sidepocket heres a key thatll fit I guesslets see  And with that she turned it in the lock but alasQueequegs supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn withinHave to burst it open said I and was running down the entry alittle for a good start when the landlady caught at me againvowing I should not break down her premises but I tore from her andwith a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the markWith a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slammingagainst the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there goodheavens there sat Queequeg altogether cool and selfcollectedright in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holdingYojo on top of his head  He looked neither one way nor the otherway but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active lifeQueequeg said I going up to him Queequeg whats the matterwith youHe haint been a sittin so all day has he said the landladyBut all we said not a word could we drag out of him I almost feltlike pushing him over so as to change his position for it wasalmost intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturallyconstrained especially as in all probability he had been sitting sofor upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regularmealsMrs Hussey said I hes ALIVE at all events so leave us if youplease and I will see to this strange affair myselfClosing the door upon the landlady I endeavored to prevail uponQueequeg to take a chair but in vain  There he sat and all hecould dofor all my polite arts and blandishmentshe would not movea peg nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice mypresence in the slightest wayI wonder thought I if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadando they fast on their hams that way in his native island  It must beso yes its part of his creed I suppose well then let himrest hell get up sooner or later no doubt  It cant last forever thank God and his Ramadan only comes once a year and I dontbelieve its very punctual thenI went down to supper  After sitting a long time listening to thelong stories of some sailors who had just come from a plumpuddingvoyage as they called it that is a short whalingvoyage in aschooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the AtlanticOcean only after listening to these plumpuddingers till nearlyeleven oclock I went up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure bythis time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to atermination  But no there he was just where I had left him he hadnot stirred an inch  I began to grow vexed with him it seemed sodownright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and halfthe night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on hisheadFor heavens sake Queequeg get up and shake yourself get up andhave some supper  Youll starve youll kill yourself QueequegBut not a word did he replyDespairing of him therefore I determined to go to bed and to sleepand no doubt before a great while he would follow me  But previousto turning in I took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it overhim as it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing buthis ordinary round jacket on  For some time do all I would I couldnot get into the faintest doze  I had blown out the candle and themere thought of Queequegnot four feet offsitting there in thatuneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this made mereally wretched  Think of it sleeping all night in the same roomwith a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountableRamadanBut somehow I dropped off at last and knew nothing more till breakof day when looking over the bedside there squatted Queequeg asif he had been screwed down to the floor  But as soon as the firstglimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and gratingjoints but with a cheerful look limped towards me where I laypressed his forehead again against mine and said his Ramadan wasoverNow as I before hinted I have no objection to any personsreligion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill orinsult any other person because that other person dont believe italso  But when a mans religion becomes really frantic when it is apositive torment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours anuncomfortable inn to lodge in then I think it high time to take thatindividual aside and argue the point with himAnd just so I now did with Queequeg  Queequeg said I get intobed now and lie and listen to me  I then went on beginning withthe rise and progress of the primitive religions and coming down tothe various religions of the present time during which time Ilabored to show Queequeg that all these Lents Ramadans andprolonged hamsquattings in cold cheerless rooms were starknonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed inshort to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense  I told himtoo that he being in other things such an extremely sensible andsagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him nowso deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his  Besidesargued I fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves inand all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be halfstarvedThis is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish suchmelancholy notions about their hereafters  In one word Queequegsaid I rather digressively hell is an idea first born on anundigested appledumpling and since then perpetuated through thehereditary dyspepsias nurtured by RamadansI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled withdyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take itin  He said no only upon one memorable occasion  It was after agreat feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a greatbattle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about twooclock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very eveningNo more Queequeg said I shuddering that will do for I knewthe inferences without his further hinting them  I had seen a sailorwho had visited that very island and he told me that it was thecustom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue allthe slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by onethey were placed in great wooden trenchers and garnished round likea pilau with breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley intheir mouths were sent round with the victors compliments to allhis friends just as though these presents were so many ChristmasturkeysAfter all I do not think that my remarks about religion made muchimpression upon Queequeg  Because in the first place he somehowseemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless consideredfrom his own point of view and in the second place he did not morethan one third understand me couch my ideas simply as I would andfinally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the truereligion than I did  He looked at me with a sort of condescendingconcern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity thatsuch a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelicalpagan pietyAt last we rose and dressed and Queequeg taking a prodigiouslyhearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landladyshould not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan we sallied outto board the Pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth withhalibut bonesCHAPTER 18His MarkAs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the shipQueequeg carrying his harpoon Captain Peleg in his gruff voiceloudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he had not suspected myfriend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let nocannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced theirpapersWhat do you mean by that Captain Peleg said I now jumping on thebulwarks and leaving my comrade standing on the wharfI mean he replied he must show his papersYes said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice sticking his headfrom behind Pelegs out of the wigwam  He must show that hesconverted  Son of darkness he added turning to Queequeg artthou at present in communion with any Christian churchWhy said I hes a member of the first Congregational ChurchHere be it said that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucketships at last come to be converted into the churchesFirst Congregational Church cried Bildad what that worships inDeacon Deuteronomy Colemans meetinghouse and so saying takingout his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandanahandkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of thewigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long lookat QueequegHow long hath he been a member he then said turning to me notvery long I rather guess young manNo said Peleg and he hasnt been baptized right either or itwould have washed some of that devils blue off his faceDo tell now cried Bildad is this Philistine a regular member ofDeacon Deuteronomys meeting  I never saw him going there and Ipass it every Lords dayI dont know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting saidI all I know is that Queequeg here is a born member of the FirstCongregational Church  He is a deacon himself Queequeg isYoung man said Bildad sternly thou art skylarking withmeexplain thyself thou young Hittite  What church dost thee meananswer meFinding myself thus hard pushed I replied  I mean sir the sameancient Catholic Church to which you and I and Captain Peleg thereand Queequeg here and all of us and every mothers son and soul ofus belong the great and everlasting First Congregation of this wholeworshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherishsome queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in THAT weall join handsSplice thou meanst SPLICE hands cried Peleg drawing nearerYoung man youd better ship for a missionary instead of aforemast hand I never heard a better sermon  DeaconDeuteronomywhy Father Mapple himself couldnt beat it and hesreckoned something  Come aboard come aboard never mind about thepapers  I say tell Quohog therewhats that you call him tellQuohog to step along  By the great anchor what a harpoon hes gotthere looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right  Isay Quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the headof a whaleboat did you ever strike a fishWithout saying a word Queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped uponthe bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboatshanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising hisharpoon cried out in some such way as thisCapain you see him small drop tar on water dere  You see himwell spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim atit he darted the iron right over old Bildads broad brim cleanacross the ships decks and struck the glistening tar spot out ofsightNow said Queequeg quietly hauling in the line sposee himwhalee eye why dad whale deadQuick Bildad said Peleg his partner who aghast at the closevicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabingangway  Quick I say you Bildad and get the ships papers  Wemust have Hedgehog there I mean Quohog in one of our boats  Lookye Quohog well give ye the ninetieth lay and thats more thanever was given a harpooneer yet out of NantucketSo down we went into the cabin and to my great joy Queequeg was soonenrolled among the same ships company to which I myself belongedWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything readyfor signing he turned to me and said I guess Quohog there dontknow how to write does he  I say Quohog blast ye dost thou signthy name or make thy markBut at this question Queequeg who had twice or thrice before takenpart in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking theoffered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exactcounterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his armso that through Captain Pelegs obstinate mistake touching hisappellative it stood something like thisQuohoghis X markMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeingQueequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the hugepockets of his broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tractsand selecting one entitled The Latter Day Coming or No Time toLose placed it in Queequegs hands and then grasping them and thebook with both his looked earnestly into his eyes and said Son ofdarkness I must do my duty by thee I am part owner of this shipand feel concerned for the souls of all its crew if thou stillclingest to thy Pagan ways which I sadly fear I beseech theeremain not for aye a Belial bondsman  Spurn the idol Bell and thehideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye I sayoh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pitSomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildads languageheterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrasesAvast there avast there Bildad avast now spoiling ourharpooneer Peleg  Pious harpooneers never make good voyagersittakes the shark out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aintpretty sharkish  There was young Nat Swaine once the bravestboatheader out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard he joined themeeting and never came to good  He got so frightened about hisplaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fearof afterclaps in case he got stove and went to Davy JonesPeleg  Peleg said Bildad lifting his eyes and hands thouthyself as I myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowestPeleg what it is to have the fear of death how then canst thouprate in this ungodly guise  Thou beliest thine own heart PelegTell me when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard inthat typhoon on Japan that same voyage when thou went mate withCaptain Ahab didst thou not think of Death and the Judgment thenHear him hear him now cried Peleg marching across the cabin andthrusting his hands far down into his pocketshear him all of yeThink of that  When every moment we thought the ship would sinkDeath and the Judgment then  What  With all three masts making suchan everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breakingover us fore and aft  Think of Death and the Judgment then  Nono time to think about Death then  Life was what Captain Ahab and Iwas thinking of and how to save all handshow to rigjurymastshow to get into the nearest port that was what I wasthinking ofBildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deckwhere we followed him  There he stood very quietly overlooking somesailmakers who were mending a topsail in the waist  Now and then hestooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine whichotherwise might have been wastedCHAPTER 19The ProphetShipmates have ye shipped in that shipQueequeg and I had just left the Pequod and were sauntering away fromthe water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts whenthe above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before uslevelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question  He wasbut shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a ragof a black handkerchief investing his neck  A confluent smallpoxhad in all directions flowed over his face and left it like thecomplicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters havebeen dried upHave ye shipped in her he repeatedYou mean the ship Pequod I suppose said I trying to gain alittle more time for an uninterrupted look at himAye the Pequodthat ship there he said drawing back his wholearm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him with thefixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the objectYes said I we have just signed the articlesAnything down there about your soulsAbout whatOh perhaps you havnt got any he said quickly  No matterthough I know many chaps that havnt got anygood luck to emand they are all the better off for it  A souls a sort of a fifthwheel to a wagonWhat are you jabbering about shipmate said IHES got enough though to make up for all deficiencies of thatsort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing a nervousemphasis upon the word HEQueequeg said I lets go this fellow has broken loose fromsomewhere hes talking about something and somebody we dont knowStop cried the stranger  Ye said trueye havnt seen OldThunder yet have yeWhos Old Thunder said I again riveted with the insaneearnestness of his mannerCaptain AhabWhat the captain of our ship the PequodAye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name  Yehavnt seen him yet have yeNo we havnt  Hes sick they say but is getting better and willbe all right again before longAll right again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnlyderisive sort of laugh  Look ye when Captain Ahab is all rightthen this left arm of mine will be all right not beforeWhat do you know about himWhat did they TELL you about him  Say thatThey didnt tell much of anything about him only Ive heard thathes a good whalehunter and a good captain to his crewThats true thats trueyes both true enough  But you must jumpwhen he gives an order  Step and growl growl and gothats theword with Captain Ahab  But nothing about that thing that happenedto him off Cape Horn long ago when he lay like dead for three daysand nights nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniardafore the altar in Santaheard nothing about that eh  Nothingabout the silver calabash he spat into  And nothing about his losinghis leg last voyage according to the prophecy  Didnt ye hear aword about them matters and something more eh  No I dont think yedid how could ye  Who knows it  Not all Nantucket I guess  Buthowsever mayhap yeve heard tell about the leg and how he lostit aye ye have heard of that I dare say  Oh yes THAT every oneknows amostI mean they know hes only one leg and that aparmacetti took the other offMy friend said I what all this gibberish of yours is about Idont know and I dont much care for it seems to me that you mustbe a little damaged in the head  But if you are speaking of CaptainAhab of that ship there the Pequod then let me tell you that Iknow all about the loss of his legALL about it ehsure you doallPretty sureWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod the beggarlikestranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting alittle turned and saidYeve shipped have ye  Names down on

himthe likes of ye  Morning to yeshipmates morning  Oh when ye get there tell em Ive concludednot to make one of emAh my dear fellow you cant fool us that wayyou cant fool usIt is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had agreat secret in himMorning to ye shipmates morningMorning it is said I  Come along Queequeg lets leave thiscrazy man  But stop tell me your name will youElijahElijah thought I and we walked away both commenting after eachothers fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he wasnothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear  But we had not goneperhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner andlooking back as I did so who should be seen but Elijah following usthough at a distance  Somehow the sight of him struck me so that Isaid nothing to Queequeg of his being behind but passed on with mycomrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the samecorner that we did  He did and then it seemed to me that he wasdogging us but with what intent I could not for the life of meimagine  This circumstance coupled with his ambiguoushalfhinting halfrevealing shrouded sort of talk now begat in meall kinds of vague wonderments and halfapprehensions and allconnected with the Pequod and Captain Ahab and the leg he had lostand the Cape Horn fit and the silver calabash and what CaptainPeleg had said of him when I left the ship the day previous and theprediction of the squaw Tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselvesto sail and a hundred other shadowy thingsI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah wasreally dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way withQueequeg and on that side of it retraced our steps  But Elijahpassed on without seeming to notice us  This relieved me and oncemore and finally as it seemed to me I pronounced him in my heart ahumbugCHAPTER 20All AstirA day or two passed and there was great activity aboard the PequodNot only were the old sails being mended but new sails were comingon board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in shorteverything betokened that the ships preparations were hurrying to aclose  Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in hiswigwam keeping a sharp lookout upon the hands Bildad did all thepurchasing and providing at the stores and the men employed in thehold and on the rigging were working till long after nightfallOn the day following Queequegs signing the articles word was givenat all the inns where the ships company were stopping that theirchests must be on board before night for there was no telling howsoon the vessel might be sailing  So Queequeg and I got down ourtraps resolving however to sleep ashore till the last  But itseems they always give very long notice in these cases and the shipdid not sail for several days  But no wonder there was a good dealto be done and there is no telling how many things to be thought ofbefore the Pequod was fully equippedEvery one knows what a multitude of thingsbeds saucepans knivesand forks shovels and tongs napkins nutcrackers and what notare indispensable to the business of housekeeping  Just so withwhaling which necessitates a threeyears housekeeping upon the wideocean far from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers andbankers  And though this also holds true of merchant vessels yetnot by any means to the same extent as with whalemen  For besidesthe great length of the whaling voyage the numerous articlespeculiar to the prosecution of the fishery and the impossibility ofreplacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented it must beremembered that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposedto accidents of all kinds and especially to the destruction and lossof the very things upon which the success of the voyage most dependsHence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and harpoonsand spare everythings almost but a spare Captain and duplicateshipAt the period of our arrival at the Island the heaviest storage ofthe Pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef breadwater fuel and iron hoops and staves  But as before hinted forsome time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board ofdivers odds and ends of things both large and smallChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was CaptainBildads sister a lean old lady of a most determined andindefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemedresolved that if SHE could help it nothing should be found wantingin the Pequod after once fairly getting to sea  At one time shewould come on board with a jar of pickles for the stewards pantryanother time with a bunch of quills for the chief mates desk wherehe kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small ofsome ones rheumatic back  Never did any woman better deserve hername which was CharityAunt Charity as everybody called her  Andlike a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustleabout hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart toanything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation toall on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad wasconcerned and in which she herself owned a score or two ofwellsaved dollarsBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress comingon board as she did the last day with a long oilladle in one handand a still longer whaling lance in the other  Nor was Bildad himselfnor Captain Peleg at all backward  As for Bildad he carried aboutwith him a long list of the articles needed and at every fresharrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paperEvery once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone denroaring at the men down the hatchways roaring up to the riggers atthe masthead and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwamDuring these days of preparation Queequeg and I often visited thecraft and as often I asked about Captain Ahab and how he was andwhen he was going to come on board his ship  To these questions theywould answer that he was getting better and better and was expectedaboard every day meantime the two captains Peleg and Bildad couldattend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage  IfI had been downright honest with myself I would have seen veryplainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed thisway to so long a voyage without once laying my eyes on the man whowas to be the absolute dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed outupon the open sea  But when a man suspects any wrong it sometimeshappens that if he be already involved in the matter he insensiblystrives to cover up his suspicions even from himself  And much thisway it was with me  I said nothing and tried to think nothingAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship wouldcertainly sail  So next morning Queequeg and I took a very earlystartCHAPTER 21Going AboardIt was nearly six oclock but only grey imperfect misty dawn whenwe drew nigh the wharfThere are some sailors running ahead there if I see right said Ito Queequeg it cant be shadows shes off by sunrise I guesscome onAvast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming closebehind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuatinghimself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertaintwilight strangely peering from Queequeg to me  It was ElijahGoing aboardHands off will you said ILookee here said Queequeg shaking himself go wayAint going aboard thenYes we are said I but what business is that of yours  Do youknow Mr Elijah that I consider you a little impertinentNo no no I wasnt aware of that said Elijah slowly andwonderingly looking from me to Queequeg with the most unaccountableglancesElijah said I you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawingWe are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans and would prefer notto be detainedYe be be ye  Coming back afore breakfastHes cracked Queequeg said I come onHolloa cried stationary Elijah hailing us when we had removed afew pacesNever mind him said I Queequeg come onBut he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on myshoulder saidDid ye see anything looking like men going towardsthat ship a while agoStruck by this plain matteroffact question I answered sayingYes I thought I did see four or five men but it was too dim to besureVery dim very dim said Elijah  Morning to yeOnce more we quitted him but once more he came softly after us andtouching my shoulder again said See if you can find em now willyeFind whoMorning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off  OhI was going to warn ye againstbut never mind never mindits allone all in the family toosharp frost this morning aint itGoodbye to ye  Shant see ye again very soon I guess unless itsbefore the Grand Jury  And with these cracked words he finallydeparted leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at hisfrantic impudenceAt last stepping on board the Pequod we found everything inprofound quiet not a soul moving  The cabin entrance was lockedwithin the hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of riggingGoing forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttleopen  Seeing a light we went down and found only an old riggerthere wrapped in a tattered peajacket  He was thrown at wholelength upon two chests his face downwards and inclosed in his foldedarms  The profoundest slumber slept upon himThose sailors we saw Queequeg where can they have gone to saidI looking dubiously at the sleeper  But it seemed that when on thewharf Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to hence Iwould have thought myself to have been optically deceived in thatmatter were it not for Elijahs otherwise inexplicable questionBut I beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularlyhinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the bodytelling him to establish himself accordingly  He put his hand uponthe sleepers rear as though feeling if it was soft enough andthen without more ado sat quietly down thereGracious  Queequeg dont sit there said IOh perry dood seat said Queequeg my country way wont hurthim faceFace said I call that his face very benevolent countenancethen but how hard he breathes hes heaving himself get offQueequeg you are heavy its grinding the face of the poor  Getoff Queequeg  Look hell twitch you off soon  I wonder he dontwakeQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper andlighted his tomahawk pipe  I sat at the feet  We kept the pipepassing over the sleeper from one to the other  Meanwhile uponquestioning him in his broken fashion Queequeg gave me to understandthat in his land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of allsorts the king chiefs and great people generally were in thecustom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans and tofurnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to buy upeight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers andalcoves  Besides it was very convenient on an excursion muchbetter than those gardenchairs which are convertible intowalkingsticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant anddesiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading treeperhaps in some damp marshy placeWhile narrating these things every time Queequeg received thetomahawk from me he flourished the hatchetside of it over thesleepers headWhats that for QueequegPerry easy kille oh perry easyHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawkpipewhich it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes andsoothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleepingrigger  The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted holeit began to tell upon him  He breathed with a sort of mufflednessthen seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twicethen sat up and rubbed his eyesHolloa he breathed at last who be ye smokersShipped men answered I when does she sailAye aye ye are going in her be ye  She sails today  TheCaptain came aboard last nightWhat CaptainAhabWho but him indeedI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab whenwe heard a noise on deckHolloa  Starbucks astir said the rigger  Hes a lively chiefmate that good man and a pious but all alive now I must turnto  And so saying he went on deck and we followedIt was now clear sunrise  Soon the crew came on board in twos andthrees the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were activelyengaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringingvarious last things on board  Meanwhile Captain Ahab remainedinvisibly enshrined within his cabinCHAPTER 22Merry ChristmasAt length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the shipsriggers and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf andafter the everthoughtful Charity had come off in a whaleboat withher last gifta nightcap for Stubb the second mate herbrotherinlaw and a spare Bible for the stewardafter all thisthe two Captains Peleg and Bildad issued from the cabin andturning to the chief mate Peleg saidNow Mr Starbuck are you sure everything is right  Captain Ahabis all readyjust spoke to himnothing more to be got from shoreeh  Well call all hands then  Muster em aft hereblast emNo need of profane words however great the hurry Peleg saidBildad but away with thee friend Starbuck and do our biddingHow now  Here upon the very point of starting for the voyageCaptain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand onthe quarterdeck just as if they were to be jointcommanders at seaas well as to all appearances in port  And as for Captain Ahab nosign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabinBut then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessaryin getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to seaIndeed as that was not at all his proper business but the pilotsand as he was not yet completely recoveredso they saidthereforeCaptain Ahab stayed below  And all this seemed natural enoughespecially as in the merchant service many captains never showthemselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up theanchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewellmerrymaking with their shore friends before they quit the ship forgood with the pilotBut there was not much chance to think over the matter for CaptainPeleg was now all alive  He seemed to do most of the talking andcommanding and not BildadAft here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingeredat the mainmast  Mr Starbuck driveem aftStrike the tent therewas the next order  As I hinted beforethis whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on boardthe Pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was wellknown to be the next thing to heaving up the anchorMan the capstan  Blood and thunderjumpwas the next commandand the crew sprang for the handspikesNow in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by thepilot is the forward part of the ship  And here Bildad who withPeleg be it known in addition to his other officers was one of thelicensed pilots of the porthe being suspected to have got himselfmade a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilotfee to all theships he was concerned in for he never piloted any othercraftBildad I say might now be seen actively engaged in lookingover the bows for the approaching anchor and at intervals singingwhat seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at thewindlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls inBooble Alley with hearty good will  Nevertheless not three daysprevious Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowedon board the Pequod particularly in getting under weigh andCharity his sister had placed a small choice copy of Watts in eachseamans berthMeantime overseeing the other part of the ship Captain Peleg rippedand swore astern in the most frightful manner  I almost thought hewould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarilyI paused on my handspike and told Queequeg to do the same thinkingof the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such adevil for a pilot  I was comforting myself however with thethought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation spite ofhis seven hundred and seventyseventh lay when I felt a sudden sharppoke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparitionof Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediatevicinity  That was my first kickIs that the way they heave in the marchant service he roaredSpring thou sheephead spring and break thy backbone  Why dontye spring I say all of yespring  Quohog spring thou chap withthe red whiskers spring there Scotchcap spring thou greenpants  Spring I say all of ye and spring your eyes out  And sosaying he moved along the windlass here and there using his legvery freely while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with hispsalmody  Thinks I Captain Peleg must have been drinking somethingtodayAt last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided  Itwas a short cold Christmas and as the short northern day mergedinto night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry oceanwhose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor  The longrows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and likethe white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving iciclesdepended from the bowsLank Bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon asthe old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shiveringfrost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang hissteady notes were heardSweet fields beyond the swelling floodStand dressed in living greenSo to the Jews old Canaan stoodWhile Jordan rolled betweenNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then  Theywere full of hope and fruition  Spite of this frigid winter night inthe boisterous Atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacketthere was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in storeand meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up bythe spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummerAt last we gained such an offing that the two pilots were needed nolonger  The stout sailboat that had accompanied us began rangingalongsideIt was curious and not unpleasing how Peleg and Bildad were affectedat this juncture especially Captain Bildad  For loath to departyet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long andperilous a voyagebeyond both stormy Capes a ship in which somethousands of his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in whichan old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he oncemore starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loathto say goodbye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest tohimpoor old Bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxiousstrides ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell wordthere again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards thewide and endless waters only bounded by the faroff unseen EasternContinents looked towards the land looked aloft looked right andleft looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanicallycoiling a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout Peleg by thehand and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroicallyin his face as much as to say Nevertheless friend Peleg I canstand it yes I canAs for Peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for allhis philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when thelantern came too near  And he too did not a little run from cabinto decknow a word below and now a word with Starbuck the chiefmateBut at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of lookabout himCaptain Bildadcome old shipmate we must go  Backthe mainyard there  Boat ahoy  Stand by to come close

Captain Bildad stop palaveringaway and with thatPeleg hurried him over the side and both dropt into the boatShip and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between ascreaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gavethree heavyhearted cheers and blindly plunged like fate into thelone AtlanticCHAPTER 23The Lee ShoreSome chapters back one Bulkington was spoken of a tall newlandedmariner encountered in New Bedford at the innWhen on that shivering winters night the Pequod thrust hervindictive bows into the cold malicious waves who should I seestanding at her helm but

apotheosisCHAPTER 24The AdvocateAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business ofwhaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to beregarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputablepursuit therefore I am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen ofthe injustice hereby done to us hunters of whalesIn the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establishthe fact that among people at large the business of whaling is notaccounted on a level with what are called the liberal professionsIf a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitansociety it would but slightly advance the general opinion of hismerits were he presented to the company as a harpooneer say and ifin emulation of the naval officers he should append the initialsSWF Sperm Whale Fishery to his visiting card such a procedurewould be deemed preeminently presuming and ridiculousDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring uswhalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts toa butchering sort of business and that when actively engagedtherein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements  Butchers weare that is true  But butchers also and butchers of the bloodiestbadge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariablydelights to honour  And as for the matter of the allegeduncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated intocertain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon thewhole will triumphantly plant the sperm whaleship at least amongthe cleanliest things of this tidy earth  But even granting thecharge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of awhaleship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of thosebattlefields from which so many soldiers return to drink in allladies plaudits  And if the idea of peril so much enhances thepopular conceit of the soldiers profession let me assure ye thatmany a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would quicklyrecoil at the apparition of the sperm whales vast tail fanning intoeddies the air over his head  For what are the comprehensibleterrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders ofGodBut though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does itunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an allaboundingadoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burnround the globe burn as before so many shrines to our gloryBut look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts ofscales see what we whalemen are and have beenWhy did the Dutch in De Witts time have admirals of their whalingfleets  Why did Louis XVI of France at his own personal expensefit out whaling ships from Dunkirk and politely invite to that townsome score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket  Whydid Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen inbounties upwards of L1000000  And lastly how comes it that wewhalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemenin the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels mannedby eighteen thousand men yearly consuming 4000000 of dollars theships worth at the time of sailing 20000000 and every yearimporting into our harbors a well reaped harvest of 7000000  Howcomes all this if there be not something puissant in whalingBut this is not the half look againI freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for hislife point out one single peaceful influence which within the lastsixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad worldtaken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whalingOne way and another it has begotten events so remarkable inthemselves and so continuously momentous in their sequential issuesthat whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother who boreoffspring themselves pregnant from her womb  It would be a hopelessendless task to catalogue all these things  Let a handful sufficeFor many years past the whaleship has been the pioneer in ferretingout the remotest and least known parts of the earth  She hasexplored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart where no Cook orVancouver had ever sailed  If American and European menofwarnow peacefully ride in once savage harbors let them fire salutes tothe honour and glory of the whaleship which originally showed themthe way and first interpreted between them and the savages  Theymay celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions yourCooks your Krusensterns but I say that scores of anonymousCaptains have sailed out of Nantucket that were as great andgreater than your Cook and your Krusenstern  For in theirsuccourless emptyhandedness they in the heathenish sharked watersand by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled withvirgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines andmuskets would not willingly have dared  All that is made such aflourish of in the old South Sea Voyages those things were but thelifetime commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers  Oftenadventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to these menaccounted unworthy of being set down in the ships common log  Ahthe world  Oh the worldUntil the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn no commerce but colonialscarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between Europeand the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacificcoast  It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealouspolicy of the Spanish crown touching those colonies and if spacepermitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen atlast eventuated the liberation of Peru Chili and Bolivia from theyoke of Old Spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy inthose partsThat great America on the other side of the sphere Australia wasgiven to the enlightened world by the whaleman  After its firstblunderborn discovery by a Dutchman all other ships long shunnedthose shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whaleship touchedthere  The whaleship is the true mother of that now mighty colonyMoreover in the infancy of the first Australian settlement theemigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolentbiscuit of the whaleship luckily dropping an anchor in their watersThe uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth and docommercial homage to the whaleship that cleared the way for themissionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitivemissionaries to their first destinations  If that doubleboltedland Japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whaleship aloneto whom the credit will be due for already she is on the thresholdBut if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling hasno aesthetically noble associations connected with it then am Iready to shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with asplit helmet every timeThe whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler youwill sayTHE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER  Whowrote the first account of our Leviathan  Who but mighty Job  Andwho composed the first narrative of a whalingvoyage  Who but noless a prince than Alfred the Great who with his own royal pentook down the words from Other the Norwegian whalehunter of thosetimes  And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament  Whobut Edmund BurkeTrue enough but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they haveno good blood in their veinsNO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS  They have something better than royalblood there  The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrelafterwards by marriage Mary Folger one of the old settlers ofNantucket and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers andharpooneersall kith and kin to noble Benjaminthis day darting thebarbed iron from one side of the world to the otherGood again but then all confess that somehow whaling is notrespectableWHALING NOT RESPECTABLE  Whaling is imperial  By old Englishstatutory law the whale is declared a royal fishOh thats only nominal  The whale himself has never figured in anygrand imposing wayTHE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY  In one of themighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering theworlds capital the bones of a whale brought all the way from theSyrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballedprocessionSee subsequent chapters for something more on this headGrant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no realdignity in whalingNO DIGNITY IN WHALING  The dignity of our calling the very heavensattest  Cetus is a constellation in the South  No more  Drivedown your hat in presence of the Czar and take it off to QueequegNo more  I know a man that in his lifetime has taken three hundredand fifty whales  I account that man more honourable than that greatcaptain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled townsAnd as for me if by any possibility there be any as yetundiscovered prime thing in me if I shall ever deserve any realrepute in that small but high hushed world which I might not beunreasonably ambitious of if hereafter I shall do anything that uponthe whole a man might rather have done than to have left undone ifat my death my executors or more properly my creditors find anyprecious MSS in my desk then here I prospectively ascribe all thehonour and the glory to whaling for a whaleship was my Yale Collegeand my HarvardCHAPTER 25PostscriptIn behalf of the dignity of whaling I would fain advance naught butsubstantiated facts  But after embattling his facts an advocate whoshould wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might telleloquently upon his causesuch an advocate would he not beblameworthyIt is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens evenmodern ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for theirfunctions is gone through  There is a saltcellar of state socalled and there may be a castor of state  How they use the saltpreciselywho knows  Certain I am however that a kings head issolemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad  Can itbe though that they anoint it with a view of making its interiorrun well as they anoint machinery  Much might be ruminated hereconcerning the essential dignity of this regal process because incommon life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow whoanoints his hair and palpably smells of that anointing  In truth amature man who uses hairoil unless medicinally that man hasprobably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere  As a general rule hecant amount to much in his totalityBut the only thing to be considered here is thiswhat kind of oilis used at coronations  Certainly it cannot be olive oil normacassar oil nor castor oil nor bears oil nor train oil norcodliver oil  What then can it possibly be but sperm oil inits unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweetest of all oilsThink of that ye loyal Britons we whalemen supply your kings andqueens with coronation stuffCHAPTER 26Knights and SquiresThe chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck a native of Nantucket anda Quaker by descent  He was a long earnest man and though born onan icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his fleshbeing hard as twicebaked biscuit  Transported to the Indies hislive blood would not spoil like bottled ale  He must have been bornin some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fastdays for which his state is famous  Only some thirty arid summershad he seen those summers had dried up all his physicalsuperfluousness  But this his thinness so to speak seemed no morethe token of wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed theindication of any bodily blight  It was merely the condensation ofthe man  He was by no means illlooking quite the contrary  Hispure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped up in itand embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivifiedEgyptian this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages tocome and to endure always as now for be it Polar snow or torridsun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warrantedto do well in all climates  Looking into his eyes you seemed tosee there the yet lingering images of those thousandfold perils hehad calmly confronted through life  A staid steadfast man whoselife for the most part was a telling pantomime of action and not atame chapter of sounds  Yet for all his hardy sobriety andfortitude there were certain qualities in him which at timesaffected and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all therest  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deepnatural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life didtherefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort ofsuperstition which in some organizations seems rather to springsomehow from intelligence than from ignorance  Outward portents andinward presentiments were his  And if at times these things bent thewelded iron of his soul much more did his faraway domestic memoriesof his young Cape wife and child tend to bend him still more fromthe original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further tothose latent influences which in some honesthearted men restrainthe gush of daredevil daring so often evinced by others in the moreperilous vicissitudes of the fishery  I will have no man in myboat said Starbuck who is not afraid of a whale  By this heseemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful couragewas that which arises from the fair estimation of the encounteredperil but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerouscomrade than a cowardAye aye said Stubb the second mate Starbuck there is ascareful a man as youll find anywhere in this fishery  But we shallere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by aman like Stubb or almost any other whale hunterStarbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not asentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand uponall mortally practical occasions  Besides he thought perhaps thatin this business of whaling courage was one of the great stapleoutfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to befoolishly wasted  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whalesafter sundown nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too muchpersisted in fighting him  For thought Starbuck I am here in thiscritical ocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed bythem for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuckwell knew  What doom was his own fathers  Where in the bottomlessdeeps could he find the torn limbs of his brotherWith memories like these in him and moreover given to a certainsuperstitiousness as has been said the courage of this Starbuckwhich could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have beenextreme  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man soorganized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as hehad it was not in nature that these things should fail in latentlyengendering an element in him which under suitable circumstanceswould break out from its confinement and burn all his courage upAnd brave as he might be it was that sort of bravery chieflyvisible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm inthe conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinaryirrational horrors of the world yet cannot withstand those moreterrific because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace youfrom the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty manBut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the completeabasement of poor Starbucks fortitude scarce might I have the heartto write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking toexpose the fall of valour in the soul  Men may seem detestable asjoint stockcompanies and nations knaves fools and murderers theremay be men may have mean and meagre faces but man in the idealis so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature thatover any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run tothrow their costliest robes  That immaculate manliness we feelwithin ourselves so far within us that it remains intact though allthe outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at theundraped spectacle of a valorruined man  Nor can piety itself atsuch a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against thepermitting stars  But this august dignity I treat of is not thedignity of kings and robes but that abounding dignity which has norobed investiture  Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wieldsa pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on allhands radiates without end from God Himself  The great Godabsolute  The centre and circumference of all democracy  Hisomnipresence our divine equalityIf then to meanest mariners and renegades and castaways I shallhereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round themtragic graces if even the most mournful perchance the most abasedamong them all shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts ifI shall touch that workmans arm with some ethereal light if I shallspread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun then against allmortal critics bear me out in it thou Just Spirit of Equalitywhich hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kindBear me out in it thou great democratic God who didst not refuse tothe swart convict Bunyan the pale poetic pearl Thou who didstclothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold the stumped andpaupered arm of old Cervantes Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jacksonfrom the pebbles who didst hurl him upon a warhorse who didstthunder him higher than a throne  Thou who in all Thy mightyearthly marchings ever cullest Thy selectest champions from thekingly commons bear me out in it O GodCHAPTER 27Knights and SquiresStubb was the second mate  He was a native of Cape Cod and henceaccording to local usage was called a CapeCodman  Ahappygolucky neither craven nor valiant taking perils as theycame with an indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminentcrisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeymanjoiner engaged for the year  Goodhumored easy and careless hepresided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were buta dinner and his crew all invited guests  He was as particularabout the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat as anold stagedriver is about the snugness of his box  When close to thewhale in the very deathlock of the fight he handled his unpityinglance coolly and offhandedly as a whistling tinker his hammer  Hewould hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with themost exasperated monster  Long usage had for this Stubb convertedthe jaws of death into an easy chair  What he thought of deathitself there is no telling  Whether he ever thought of it at allmight be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mind thatway after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he tookit to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestirthemselves there about something which he would find out when heobeyed the order and not soonerWhat perhaps with other things made Stubb such an easygoingunfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in aworld full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with theirpacks what helped to bring about that almost impious goodhumor ofhis that thing must have been his pipe  For like his nose hisshort black little pipe was one of the regular features of his faceYou would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunkwithout his nose as without his pipe  He kept a whole row of pipesthere ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his handand whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in successionlighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loadingthem again to be in readiness anew  For when Stubb dressed insteadof first putting his legs into his trowsers he put his pipe into hismouthI say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least ofhis peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly airwhether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the namelessmiseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and asin time of the cholera some people go about with a camphoratedhandkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortaltribulations Stubbs tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort ofdisinfecting agentThe third mate was Flask a native of Tisbury in Marthas VineyardA short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerningwhales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans hadpersonally and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was asort of point of honour with him to destroy them wheneverencountered  So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence forthe many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways and so deadto anything like an apprehension of any possible danger fromencountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale wasbut a species of magnified mouse or at least waterrat requiringonly a little circumvention and some small application of time andtrouble in order to kill and boil  This ignorant unconsciousfearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter ofwhales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three yearsvoyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that lengthof time  As a carpenters nails are divided into wrought nails andcut nails so mankind may be similarly divided  Little Flask was oneof the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long  They calledhim KingPost on board of the Pequod because in form he could bewell likened to the short square timber known by that name in Arcticwhalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbersinserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icyconcussions of those battering seasNow these three matesStarbuck Stubb and Flask were momentousmen  They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of thePequods boats as headsmen  In that grand order of battle in whichCaptain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on thewhales these three headsmen were as captains of companies  Orbeing armed with their long keen whaling spears they were as apicked trio of lancers even as the harpooneers were flingers ofjavelinsAnd since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like aGothic Knight of old is always accompanied by his boatsteerer orharpooneer who in certain conjunctures provides him with a freshlance when the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in theassault and moreover as there generally subsists between the two aclose intimacy and friendliness it is therefore but meet that inthis place we set down who the Pequods harpooneers were and to whatheadsman each of them belongedFirst of all was Queequeg whom Starbuck the chief mate hadselected for his squire  But Queequeg is already knownNext was Tashtego an unmixed Indian from Gay Head the most westerlypromontory of Marthas Vineyard where there still exists the lastremnant of a village of red men which has long supplied theneighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daringharpooneers  In the fishery they usually go by the generic name ofGayHeaders  Tashtegos long lean sable hair his high cheekbones and black rounding eyesfor an Indian Oriental in theirlargeness but Antarctic in their glittering expressionall thissufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood ofthose proud warrior hunters who in quest of the great New Englandmoose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal forests of the mainBut no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of thewoodland Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of thesea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infalliblearrow of the sires  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snakylimbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some ofthe earlier Puritans and halfbelieved this wild Indian to be a sonof the Prince of the Powers of the Air  Tashtego was Stubb thesecond mates squireThird among the harpooneers was Daggoo a gigantic coalblacknegrosavage with a lionlike treadan Ahasuerus to beholdSuspended from his ears were two golden hoops so large that thesailors called them ringbolts and would talk of securing thetopsail halyards to them  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarilyshipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his nativecoast  And never having been anywhere in the world but in AfricaNantucket and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen andhaving now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in theships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men theyshipped Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and erect as agiraffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five inhis socks  There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him anda white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truceof a fortress  Curious to tell this imperial negro AhasuerusDaggoo was the Squire of little Flask who looked like a chessmanbeside him  As for the residue of the Pequods company be it saidthat at the present day not one in two of the many thousand menbefore the mast employed in the American whale fishery are Americansborn though pretty nearly all the officers are  Herein it is thesame with the American whale fishery as with the American army andmilitary and merchant navies and the engineering forces employed inthe construction of the American Canals and Railroads  The same Isay because in all these cases the native American liberallyprovides the brains the rest of the world as generously supplyingthe muscles  No small number of these whaling seamen belong to theAzores where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch toaugment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shoresIn like manner the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or Londonput in at the Shetland Islands to receive the full complement oftheir crew  Upon the passage homewards they drop them there againHow it is there is no telling but Islanders seem to make the bestwhalemen  They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod ISOLATOEStoo I call such not acknowledging the common continent of men buteach ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own  Yet nowfederated along one keel what a set these Isolatoes were  AnAnacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea and allthe ends of the earth accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay theworlds grievances before that bar from which not very many of themever come back  Black Little Piphe never didoh no he wentbefore  Poor Alabama boy  On the grim Pequods forecastle ye shallere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternaltime when sent for to the great quarterdeck on high he was bidstrike in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called acoward here hailed a hero thereCHAPTER 28AhabFor several days after leaving Nantucket nothing above hatches wasseen of Captain Ahab  The mates regularly relieved each other at thewatches and for aught that could be seen to the contrary theyseemed to be the only commanders of the ship only they sometimesissued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory thatafter all it was plain they but commanded vicariously  Yes theirsupreme lord and dictator was there though hitherto unseen by anyeyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of thecabinEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below I instantlygazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my firstvague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusionof the sea became almost a perturbation  This was strangelyheightened at times by the ragged Elijahs diabolical incoherencesuninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy I could not havebefore conceived of  But poorly could I withstand them much as inother moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalitiesof that outlandish prophet of the wharves  But whatever it was ofapprehensiveness or uneasinessto call it sowhich I felt yetwhenever I came to look about me in the ship it seemed against allwarrantry to cherish such emotions  For though the harpooneers withthe great body of the crew were a far more barbaric heathenish andmotley set than any of the tame merchantship companies which myprevious experiences had made me acquainted with still I ascribedthisand rightly ascribed itto the fierce uniqueness of the verynature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had soabandonedly embarked  But it was especially the aspect of the threechief officers of the ship the mates which was most forciblycalculated to allay these colourless misgivings and induce confidenceand cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage  Three bettermore likely seaofficers and men each in his own different waycould not readily be found and they were every one of themAmericans a Nantucketer a Vineyarder a Cape man  Now it beingChristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we hadbiting Polar weather though all the time running away from it to thesouthward and by every degree and minute of latitude which wesailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all itsintolerable weather behind us  It was one of those less loweringbut still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition whenwith a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with avindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as I mountedto the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as I levelledmy glance towards the taffrail foreboding shivers ran over meReality outran apprehension Captain Ahab stood upon hisquarterdeckThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of therecovery from any  He looked like a man cut away from the stakewhen the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs withoutconsuming them or taking away one particle from their compacted agedrobustness  His whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronzeand shaped in an unalterable mould like Cellinis cast PerseusThreading its way out from among his grey hairs and continuing rightdown one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till itdisappeared in his clothing you saw a slender rodlike mark lividlywhitish  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in thestraight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightningtearingly darts down it and without wrenching a single twig peelsand grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into thesoil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded  Whetherthat mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by somedesperate wound no one could certainly say  By some tacit consentthroughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to itespecially by the mates  But once Tashtegos senior an old GayHeadIndian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he wasfull forty years old did Ahab become that way branded and then itcame upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in anelemental strife at sea  Yet this wild hint seemed inferentiallynegatived by what a grey Manxman insinuated an old sepulchral manwho having never before sailed out of Nantucket had never ere thislaid eye upon wild Ahab  Nevertheless the old seatraditions theimmemorial credulities popularly invested this old Manxman withpreternatural powers of discernment  So that no white sailorseriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahabshould be tranquilly laid outwhich might hardly come to pass so hemutteredthen whoever should do that last office for the deadwould find a birthmark on him from crown to soleSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me and thelivid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments Ihardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owingto the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood  It hadpreviously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashionedfrom the polished bone of the sperm whales jaw  Aye he wasdismasted off Japan said the old GayHead Indian once but likehis dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home forit  He has a quiver of emI was struck with the singular posture he maintained  Upon each sideof the Pequods quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shroudsthere was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into theplank  His bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated andholding by a shroud Captain Ahab stood erect looking straight outbeyond the ships everpitching prow  There was an infinity offirmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in thefixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance  Not a word hespoke nor did his officers say aught to him though by all theirminutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy ifnot painful consciousness of being under a troubled mastereye  Andnot only that but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with acrucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearingdignity of some mighty woeEre long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into hiscabin  But after that morning he was every day visible to the creweither standing in his pivothole or seated upon an ivory stool hehad or heavily walking the deck  As the sky grew less gloomyindeed began to grow a little genial he became still less and lessa recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but thedead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded  Andby and by it came to pass that he was almost continually in theair but as yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the atlast sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast  Butthe Pequod was only making a passage now not regularly cruisingnearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates werefully competent to so that there was little or nothing out ofhimself to employ or excite Ahab now and thus chase away for thatone interval the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon hisbrow as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselvesuponNevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of thepleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm himfrom his mood  For as when the redcheeked dancing girls Apriland May trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even thebarest ruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least sendforth some few green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitantsso Ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings ofthat girlish air  More than once did he put forth the faint blossomof a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in asmileCHAPTER 29Enter Ahab to Him StubbSome days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the Pequod nowwent rolling through the bright Quito spring which at sea almostperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of theTropic  The warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowingredundant days were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet heapedupflaked up with rosewater snow  The starred and stately nightsseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonelypride the memory of their absent conquering Earls the goldenhelmeted suns  For sleeping man twas hard to choose between suchwinsome days and such seducing nights  But all the witcheries ofthat unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies tothe outward world  Inward they turned upon the soul especially whenthe still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystalsas the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights  And all thesesubtle agencies more and more they wrought on Ahabs textureOld age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life theless man has to do with aught that looks like death  Amongseacommanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berthsto visit the nightcloaked deck  It was so with Ahab only that nowof late he seemed so much to live in the open air that trulyspeaking his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin tothe planks  It feels like going down into ones tombhe wouldmutter to himselffor an old captain like me to be descending thisnarrow scuttle to go to my gravedug berthSo almost every twentyfour hours when the watches of the nightwere set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the bandbelow and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle thesailors flung it not rudely down as by day but with somecautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing theirslumbering shipmates when this sort of steady quietude would beginto prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch thecabinscuttle and ere long the old man would emerge gripping at theiron banister to help his crippled way  Some considering touch ofhumanity was in him for at times like these he usually abstainedfrom patrolling the quarterdeck because to his wearied matesseeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel such would havebeen the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that theirdreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks  But oncethe mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as withheavy lumberlike pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail tomainmast Stubb the old second mate came up from below with acertain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if CaptainAhab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay butthere might be some way of muffling the noise hinting somethingindistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertioninto it of the ivory heel  Ah  Stubb thou didst not know AhabthenAm I a cannonball Stubb said Ahab that thou wouldst wad methat fashion  But go thy ways I had forgot  Below to thy nightlygrave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to thefilling one at lastDown dog and kennelStarting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenlyscornful old man Stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedlyI am not used to be spoken to that way sir I do but less than halflike it sirAvast gritted Ahab between his set teeth and violently movingaway as if to avoid some passionate temptationNo sir not yet said Stubb emboldened I will not tamely becalled a dog sirThen be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass andbegone or Ill clear the world of theeAs he said this Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrorsin his aspect that Stubb involuntarily retreatedI was never served so before without giving a hard blow for itmuttered Stubb as he found himself descending the cabinscuttleIts very queer  Stop Stubb somehow now I dont well knowwhether to go back and strike him orwhats thatdown here on myknees and pray for him  Yes that was the thought coming up in mebut it would be the first time I ever DID pray  Its queer veryqueer and hes queer too aye take him fore and aft hes about thequeerest old man Stubb ever sailed with  How he flashed at mehiseyes like powderpans is he mad  Anyway theres something on hismind as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracksHe aint in his bed now either more than three hours out of thetwentyfour and he dont sleep then  Didnt that DoughBoy thesteward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old manshammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at thefoot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sortof frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on it  A hot oldman  I guess hes got what some folks ashore call a conscience itsa kind of TicDollyrow they sayworse nor a toothache  Well wellI dont know what it is but the Lord keep me from catching it  Hesfull of riddles I wonder what he goes into the after hold for everynight as DoughBoy tells me he suspects whats that for I shouldlike to know  Whos made appointments with him in the hold  Aintthat queer now  But theres no telling its the old gameHeregoes for a snooze  Damn me its worth a fellows while to be borninto the world if only to fall right asleep  And now that I thinkof it thats about the first thing babies do and thats a sort ofqueer too  Damn me but all things are queer come to think of emBut thats against my principles  Think not is my eleventhcommandment and sleep when you can is my twelfthSo here goesagain  But hows that didnt he call me a dog blazes he called meten times a donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT  Hemight as well have kicked me and done with it  Maybe he DID kickme and I didnt observe it I was so taken all aback with his browsomehow  It flashed like a bleached bone  What the devils thematter with me  I dont stand right on my legs  Coming afoul ofthat old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out  By the Lord Imust have been dreaming thoughHow how howbut the only waysto stash it so here goes to hammock again and in the morning Illsee how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylightCHAPTER 30The PipeWhen Stubb had departed Ahab stood for a while leaning over thebulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling asailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and alsohis pipe  Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting thestool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smokedIn old Norse times the thrones of the sealoving Danish kings werefabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale  How couldone look at Ahab then seated on that tripod of bones withoutbethinking him of the royalty it symbolized  For a Khan of theplank and a king of the sea and a great lord of Leviathans wasAhabSome moments passed during which the thick vapour came from his mouthin quick and constant puffs which blew back again into his faceHow now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube thissmoking no longer soothes  Oh my pipe hard must it go with me ifthy charm be gone  Here have I been unconsciously toiling notpleasuringaye and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while towindward and with such nervous whiffs as if like the dying whalemy final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble  Whatbusiness have I with this pipe  This thing that is meant forsereneness to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs notamong torn irongrey locks like mine  Ill smoke no moreHe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea  The fire hissed inthe waves the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinkingpipe made  With slouched hat Ahab lurchingly paced the planksCHAPTER 31Queen MabNext morning Stubb accosted FlaskSuch a queer dream KingPost I never had  You know the old mansivory leg well I dreamed he kicked me with it and when I tried tokick back upon my soul my little man I kicked my leg right offAnd then presto  Ahab seemed a pyramid and I like a blazing foolkept kicking at it  But what was still more curious Flaskyou knowhow curious all dreams arethrough all this rage that I was in Isomehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was notmuch of an insult that kick from Ahab  Why thinks I whats therow  Its not a real leg only a false leg  And theres a mightydifference between a living thump and a dead thump  Thats whatmakes a blow from the hand Flask fifty times more savage to bearthan a blow from a cane  The living memberthat makes the livinginsult my little man  And thinks I to myself all the while mindwhile I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramidsoconfoundedly contradictory was it all all the while I say I wasthinking to myself whats his leg now but a canea whalebonecane  Yes thinks I it was only a playful cudgellingin factonly a whaleboning that he gave menot a base kick  Besidesthinks I look at it once why the end of itthe foot partwhat asmall sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked meTHERES a devilish broad insult  But this insult is whittled down toa point only  But now comes the greatest joke of the dream FlaskWhile I was battering away at the pyramid a sort of badgerhairedold merman with a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders andslews me round  What are you bout says he  Slid man but I wasfrightened  Such a phiz  But somehow next moment I was over thefright  What am I about says I at last  And what business isthat of yours I should like to know Mr Humpback  Do YOU want akick  By the lord Flask I had no sooner said that than he turnedround his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed hehad for a cloutwhat do you think I sawwhy thunder alive manhis stern was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out  SaysI on second thoughts I guess I wont kick you old fellow  WiseStubb said he wise Stubb and kept muttering it all the time asort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag  Seeing he wasntgoing to stop saying over his wise Stubb wise Stubb I thought Imight as well fall to kicking the pyramid again  But I had only justlifted my foot for it when he roared out Stop that kickingHalloa says I whats the matter now old fellow  Look yehere says he lets argue the insult  Captain Ahab kicked yedidnt he  Yes he did says Iright HERE it was  Verygood says hehe used his ivory leg didnt he  Yes he didsays I  Well then says he wise Stubb what have you to complainof  Didnt he kick with right good will it wasnt a common pitchpine leg he kicked with was it  No you were kicked by a great manand with a beautiful ivory leg Stubb  Its an honour I consider itan honour  Listen wise Stubb  In old England the greatest lordsthink it great glory to be slapped by a queen and madegarterknights of but be YOUR boast Stubb that ye were kicked byold Ahab and made a wise man of  Remember what I say BE kicked byhim account his kicks honours and on no account kick back for youcant help yourself wise Stubb  Dont you see that pyramid  Withthat he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion toswim off into the air  I snored rolled over and there I was in myhammock  Now what do you think of that dream FlaskI dont know it seems a sort of foolish to me thoMay be may be  But its made a wise man of me Flask  Dye seeAhab standing there sideways looking over the stern  Well the bestthing you can do Flask is to let the old man alone never speak tohim whatever he says  Halloa  Whats that he shouts  HarkMasthead there  Look sharp all of ye  There are whaleshereaboutsIf ye see a white one split your lungs for himWhat do you think of that now Flask aint there a small drop ofsomething queer about that eh  A white whaledid ye mark thatman  Look yetheres something special in the wind  Stand by forit Flask  Ahab has that thats bloody on his mind  But mum hecomes this wayCHAPTER 32CetologyAlready we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall belost in its unshored harbourless immensities  Ere that come to passere the Pequods weedy hull rolls side by side

Scoresby AD 1820It is not my intention were it in my power to enter into theinquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups andfamilies  Utter confusion exists among the historians of thisanimal sperm whale says Surgeon Beale AD 1839Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable watersImpenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea  A fieldstrewn with thorns  All these incomplete indications but serve totorture us naturalistsThus speak of the whale the great Cuvier and John Hunter andLesson those lights of zoology and anatomy  Nevertheless though ofreal knowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty andso in some small degree with cetology or the science of whalesMany are the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamenwho have at large or in little written of the whale  Run over afewThe Authors of the Bible Aristotle Pliny Aldrovandi SirThomas Browne Gesner Ray Linnaeus Rondeletius Willoughby GreenArtedi Sibbald Brisson Marten Lacepede Bonneterre DesmarestBaron Cuvier Frederick Cuvier John Hunter Owen Scoresby BealeBennett J  Ross Browne the Author of Miriam Coffin Olmstead andthe Rev  T  Cheever  But to what ultimate generalizing purpose allthese have written the above cited extracts will showOf the names in this list of whale authors only those following Owenever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professionalharpooneer and whaleman  I mean Captain Scoresby  On the separatesubject of the Greenland or rightwhale he is the best existingauthority  But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the greatsperm whale compared with which the Greenland whale is almostunworthy mentioning  And here be it said that the Greenland whaleis an usurper upon the throne of the seas  He is not even by anymeans the largest of the whales  Yet owing to the long priority ofhis claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy yearsback invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale andwhich ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some fewscientific retreats and whaleports this usurpation has been everyway complete  Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions inthe great poets of past days will satisfy you that the Greenlandwhale without one rival was to them the monarch of the seas  Butthe time has at last come for a new proclamation  This is CharingCross hear ye good people allthe Greenland whale isdeposedthe great sperm whale now reignethThere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put theliving sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotestdegree succeed in the attempt  Those books are Beales andBennetts both in their time surgeons to English SouthSeawhaleships and both exact and reliable men  The original mattertouching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarilysmall but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality thoughmostly confined to scientific description  As yet however thesperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete in anyliterature  Far above all other hunted whales his is an unwrittenlifeNow the various species of whales need some sort of popularcomprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for thepresent hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequentlaborers  As no better man advances to take this matter in hand Ihereupon offer my own poor endeavors  I promise nothing completebecause any human thing supposed to be complete must for that veryreason infallibly be faulty  I shall not pretend to a minuteanatomical description of the various species orin this place atleastto much of any description  My object here is simply toproject the draught of a systematization of cetology  I am thearchitect not the builderBut it is a ponderous task no ordinary lettersorter in thePostOffice is equal to it  To grope down into the bottom of the seaafter them to have ones hands among the unspeakable foundationsribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing  What amI that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan  The awfultauntings in Job might well appal me  Will he the leviathan makea covenant with thee  Behold the hope of him is vain  But I haveswam through libraries and sailed through oceans I have had to dowith whales with these visible hands I am in earnest and I willtry  There are some preliminaries to settleFirst The uncertain unsettled condition of this science of Cetologyis in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quartersit still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish  In hisSystem of Nature AD 1776 Linnaeus declares I hereby separatethe whales from the fish  But of my own knowledge I know that downto the year 1850 sharks and shad alewives and herring againstLinnaeuss express edict were still found dividing the possession ofthe same seas with the LeviathanThe grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whalesfrom the waters he states as follows On account of their warmbilocular heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollowears penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally exlege naturae jure meritoque  I submitted all this to my friendsSimeon Macey and Charley Coffin of Nantucket both messmates of minein a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reasonsset forth were altogether insufficient  Charley profanely hintedthey were humbugBe it known that waiving all argument I take the good old fashionedground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy Jonah to back meThis fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internalrespect does the whale differ from other fish  Above Linnaeus hasgiven you those items  But in brief they are these lungs and warmblood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold bloodedNext how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so asconspicuously to label him for all time to come  To be short thena whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL  There you havehim  However contracted that definition is the result of expandedmeditation  A walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is nota fish because he is amphibious  But the last term of thedefinition is still more cogent as coupled with the first  Almostany one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen havenot a flat but a vertical or upanddown tail  Whereas amongspouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariablyassumes a horizontal positionBy the above definition of what a whale is I do by no means excludefrom the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identifiedwith the whale by the best informed Nantucketers nor on the otherhand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded asalien  Hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fishmust be included in this groundplan of Cetology  Now then comethe grand divisions of the entire whale hostI am aware that down to the present time the fish styled Lamatinsand Dugongs Pigfish and Sowfish of the Coffins of Nantucket areincluded by many naturalists among the whales  But as these pigfishare a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths ofrivers and feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spoutI deny their credentials as whales and have presented them withtheir passports to quit the Kingdom of CetologyFirst According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primaryBOOKS subdivisible into CHAPTERS and these shall comprehend themall both small and largeI THE FOLIO WHALE II the OCTAVO WHALE III the DUODECIMO WHALEAs the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE of the OCTAVOthe GRAMPUS of the DUODECIMO the PORPOISEFOLIOS  Among these I here include the following chaptersI TheSPERM WHALE II the RIGHT WHALE III the FINBACK WHALE IV theHUMPBACKED WHALE V the RAZORBACK WHALE VI the SULPHURBOTTOMWHALEBOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER I SPERM WHALEThis whale among theEnglish of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale and the Physeterwhale and the Anvil Headed whale is the present Cachalot of theFrench and the Pottsfich of the Germans and the Macrocephalus ofthe Long Words  He is without doubt the largest inhabitant of theglobe the most formidable of all whales to encounter the mostmajestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commercehe being the only creature from which that valuable substancespermaceti is obtained  All his peculiarities will in many otherplaces be enlarged upon  It is chiefly with his name that I nowhave to do  Philologically considered it is absurd  Some centuriesago when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his ownproper individuality and when his oil was only accidentally obtainedfrom the stranded fish in those days spermaceti it would seem waspopularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with theone then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale  It wasthe idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor ofthe Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literallyexpresses  In those times also spermaceti was exceedingly scarcenot being used for light but only as an ointment and medicament  Itwas only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce ofrhubarb  When as I opine in the course of time the true nature ofspermaceti became known its original name was still retained by thedealers no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangelysignificant of its scarcity  And so the appellation must at lasthave come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermacetiwas really derivedBOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER II RIGHT WHALEIn one respect this isthe most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularlyhunted by man  It yields the article commonly known as whalebone orbaleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferiorarticle in commerce  Among the fishermen he is indiscriminatelydesignated by all the following titles The Whale the GreenlandWhale the Black Whale the Great Whale the True Whale the RightWhale  There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of thespecies thus multitudinously baptised  What then is the whale whichI include in the second species of my Folios  It is the GreatMysticetus of the English naturalists the Greenland Whale of theEnglish whalemen the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen theGrowlands Walfish of the Swedes  It is the whale which for more thantwo centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in theArctic seas it is the whale which the American fishermen have longpursued in the Indian ocean on the Brazil Banks on the Nor WestCoast and various other parts of the world designated by them RightWhale Cruising GroundsSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of theEnglish and the right whale of the Americans  But they preciselyagree in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented asingle determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinctionIt is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusivedifferences that some departments of natural history become sorepellingly intricate  The right whale will be elsewhere treated ofat some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whaleBOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER III FINBACKUnder this head I reckon amonster which by the various names of FinBack TallSpout andLongJohn has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly thewhale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossingthe Atlantic in the New York packettracks  In the length heattains and in his baleen the Finback resembles the right whalebut is of a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching toolive  His great lips present a cablelike aspect formed by theintertwisting slanting folds of large wrinkles  His granddistinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name isoften a conspicuous object  This fin is some three or four feetlong growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of anangular shape and with a very sharp pointed end  Even if not theslightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated finwill at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface  Whenthe sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with sphericalripples and this gnomonlike fin stands up and casts shadows uponthe wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circlesurrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavyhourlines graved on it  On that Ahazdial the shadow often goesback  The FinBack is not gregarious  He seems a whalehater assome men are manhaters  Very shy always going solitaryunexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullenwaters his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tallmisanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrouspower and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit fromman this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of hisrace bearing for his mark that style upon his back  From having thebaleen in his mouth the FinBack is sometimes included with theright whale among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALESthat is whales with baleen  Of these so called Whalebone whalesthere would seem to be several varieties most of which however arelittle known  Broadnosed whales and beaked whales pikeheadedwhales bunched whales underjawed whales and rostrated whales arethe fishermens names for a few sortsIn connection with this appellative of Whalebone whales it is ofgreat importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may beconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet itis in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathanfounded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teethnotwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviouslyseem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system ofCetology than any other detached bodily distinctions which thewhale in his kinds presents  How then  The baleen humpbackfin and teeth these are things whose peculiarities areindiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without anyregard to what may be the nature of their structure in other andmore essential particulars  Thus the sperm whale and the humpbackedwhale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases  Then thissame humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale each of these hasbaleen but there again the similitude ceases  And it is just thesame with the other parts above mentioned  In various sorts ofwhales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of anyone of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defyall general methodization formed upon such a basis  On this rockevery one of the whalenaturalists has splitBut it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of thewhale in his anatomythere at least we shall be able to hit theright classification  Nay what thing for example is there in theGreenland whales anatomy more striking than his baleen  Yet we haveseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify theGreenland whale  And if you descend into the bowels of the variousleviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth partas available to the systematizer as those external ones alreadyenumerated  What then remains nothing but to take hold of thewhales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort themthat way  And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted andit is the only one that can possibly succeed for it alone ispracticable  To proceedBOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER IV HUMPBACKThis whale is often seen onthe northern American coast  He has been frequently captured thereand towed into harbor  He has a great pack on him like a peddler oryou might call him the Elephant and Castle whale  At any rate thepopular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since thesperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one  His oil is notvery valuable  He has baleen  He is the most gamesome andlighthearted of all the whales making more gay foam and white watergenerally than any other of themBOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER V RAZORBACKOf this whale little isknown but his name  I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn  Ofa retiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers  Thoughno coward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back whichrises in a long sharp ridge  Let him go  I know little more of himnor does anybody elseBOOK I FOLIO CHAPTER VI SULPHURBOTTOMAnother retiringgentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping alongthe Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings  He is seldomseen at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southernseas and then always at too great a distance to study hiscountenance  He is never chased he would run away with ropewalksof line  Prodigies are told of him  Adieu Sulphur Bottom  I cansay nothing more that is true of ye nor can the oldest NantucketerThus ends BOOK I FOLIO and now begins BOOK II OCTAVOOCTAVOESThese embrace the whales of middling magnitude amongwhich present may be numberedI the GRAMPUS II the BLACK FISHIII the NARWHALE IV the THRASHER V the KILLERWhy this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plainBecause while the whales of this order though smaller than thoseof the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness tothem in figure yet the bookbinders Quarto volume in its dimensionedform does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume but the Octavovolume doesBOOK II OCTAVO CHAPTER I GRAMPUSThough this fish whoseloud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverbto landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he notpopularly classed among whales  But possessing all the granddistinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists haverecognised him for one  He is of moderate octavo size varying fromfifteen to twentyfive feet in length and of correspondingdimensions round the waist  He swims in herds he is never regularlyhunted though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty goodfor light  By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitoryof the advance of the great sperm whaleBOOK II OCTAVO CHAPTER II BLACK FISHI give the popularfishermens names for all these fish for generally they are thebest  Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive I shallsay so and suggest another  I do so now touching the Black Fishsocalled because blackness is the rule among almost all whalesSo call him the Hyena Whale if you please  His voracity is wellknown and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lipsare curved upwards he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin onhis face  This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet inlength  He is found in almost all latitudes  He has a peculiar wayof showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which looks somethinglike a Roman nose  When not more profitably employed the spermwhale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale to keep up thesupply of cheap oil for domestic employmentas some frugalhousekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone bythemselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax  Thoughtheir blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield youupwards of thirty gallons of oilBOOK II OCTAVO CHAPTER III NARWHALE that is NOSTRILWHALEAnother instance of a curiously named whale so named Isuppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peakednose  The creature is some sixteen feet in length while its hornaverages five feet though some exceed ten and even attain tofifteen feet  Strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tuskgrowing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from thehorizontal  But it is only found on the sinister side which has anill effect giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of aclumsy lefthanded man  What precise purpose this ivory horn orlance answers it would be hard to say  It does not seem to be usedlike the blade of the swordfish and billfish though some sailorstell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over thebottom of the sea for food  Charley Coffin said it was used for anicepiercer for the Narwhale rising to the surface of the PolarSea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his horn up and sobreaks through  But you cannot prove either of these surmises to becorrect  My own opinion is that however this onesided horn mayreally be used by the Narwhalehowever that may beit wouldcertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in readingpamphlets  The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale theHorned whale and the Unicorn whale  He is certainly a curiousexample of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom ofanimated nature  From certain cloistered old authors I have gatheredthat this same seaunicorns horn was in ancient days regarded as thegreat antidote against poison and as such preparations of itbrought immense prices  It was also distilled to a volatile saltsfor fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer aremanufactured into hartshorn  Originally it was in itself accountedan object of great curiosity  Black Letter tells me that Sir MartinFrobisher on his return from that voyage when Queen Bess didgallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of GreenwichPalace as his bold ship sailed down the Thames when Sir Martinreturned from that voyage saith Black Letter on bended knees hepresented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhalewhich for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor  AnIrish author avers that the Earl of Leicester on bended knees didlikewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a landbeast of the unicorn natureThe Narwhale has a very picturesque leopardlike look being of amilkwhite ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of blackHis oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of itand he is seldom hunted  He is mostly found in the circumpolar seasBOOK II OCTAVO CHAPTER IV KILLEROf this whale little isprecisely known to the Nantucketer and nothing at all to theprofessed naturalist  From what I have seen of him at a distanceI should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus  He is verysavagea sort of Feegee fish  He sometimes takes the great Foliowhales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mightybrute is worried to death  The Killer is never hunted  I neverheard what sort of oil he has  Exception might be taken to the namebestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness  Forwe are all killers on land and on sea Bonapartes and SharksincludedBOOK II OCTAVO CHAPTER V THRASHERThis gentleman is famousfor his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes  Hemounts the Folio whales back and as he swims he works his passageby flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by asimilar process  Still less is known of the Thrasher than of theKiller  Both are outlaws even in the lawless seasThus ends BOOK II OCTAVO and begins BOOK III DUODECIMODUODECIMOESThese include the smaller whales  I The HuzzaPorpoise  II The Algerine Porpoise  III The MealymouthedPorpoiseTo those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it maypossibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four orfive feet should be marshalled among WHALESa word which in thepopular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness  But the creaturesset down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms ofmy definition of what a whale isie a spouting fish with ahorizontal tailBOOK III DUODECIMO CHAPTER 1 HUZZA PORPOISEThis is thecommon porpoise found almost all over the globe  The name is of myown bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises andsomething must be done to distinguish them  I call him thus becausehe always swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keeptossing themselves to heaven like caps in a FourthofJuly crowdTheir appearance is generally hailed with delight by the marinerFull of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows towindward  They are the lads that always live before the wind  Theyare accounted a lucky omen  If you yourself can withstand threecheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye thespirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye  A wellfed plump HuzzaPorpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil  But the fineand delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuableIt is in request among jewellers and watchmakers  Sailors put it ontheir hones  Porpoise meat is good eating you know  It may neverhave occurred to you that a porpoise spouts  Indeed his spout is sosmall that it is not very readily discernible  But the next time youhave a chance watch him and you will then see the great Sperm whalehimself in miniatureBOOK III DUODECIMO CHAPTER II ALGERINE PORPOISEA pirateVery savage  He is only found I think in the Pacific  He issomewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise but much of the same generalmake  Provoke him and he will buckle to a shark  I have loweredfor him many times but never yet saw him capturedBOOK III DUODECIMO CHAPTER III MEALYMOUTHED PORPOISEThelargest kind of Porpoise and only found in the Pacific so far as itis known  The only English name by which he has hitherto beendesignated is that of the fishersRightWhale Porpoise from thecircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that FolioIn shape he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise being ofa less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat andgentlemanlike figure  He has no fins on his back most otherporpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimental Indian eyes ofa hazel hue  But his mealymouth spoils all  Though his entireback down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary linedistinct as the mark in a ships hull called the bright waistthat line streaks him from stem to stern with two separate coloursblack above and white below  The white comprises part of his headand the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had justescaped from a felonious visit to a mealbag  A most mean and mealyaspect  His oil is much like that of the common porpoiseBeyond the DUODECIMO this system does not proceed inasmuch as thePorpoise is the smallest of the whales  Above you have all theLeviathans of note  But there are a rabble of uncertain fugitivehalffabulous whales which as an American whaleman I know byreputation but not personally  I shall enumerate them by theirforecastle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable tofuture investigators who may complete what I have here but begunIf any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and markedthen he can readily be incorporated into this System according tohis Folio Octavo or Duodecimo magnitudeThe BottleNose Whalethe Junk Whale the PuddingHeaded Whale the Cape Whale the LeadingWhale the Cannon Whale the Scragg Whale the Coppered Whale theElephant Whale the Iceberg Whale the Quog Whale the Blue Whale etcFrom Icelandic Dutch and old English authorities there mightbe quoted other lists of uncertain whales blessed with all manner ofuncouth names  But I omit them as altogether obsolete and canhardly help suspecting them for mere sounds full of Leviathanismbut signifying nothingFinally It was stated at the outset that this system would not behere and at once perfected  You cannot but plainly see that I havekept my word  But I now leave my cetological System standing thusunfinished even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left with thecrane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower  Forsmall erections may be finished by their first architects grandones true ones ever leave the copestone to posterity  God keep mefrom ever completing anything  This whole book is but adraughtnay but the draught of a draught  Oh Time StrengthCash and PatienceCHAPTER 33The SpecksynderConcerning the officers of the whalecraft this seems as good aplace as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboardarising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers aclass unknown of course in any other marine than the whalefleetThe large importance attached to the harpooneers vocation is evincedby the fact that originally in the old Dutch Fishery two centuriesand more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged inthe person now called the captain but was divided between him and anofficer called the Specksynder  Literally this word meansFatCutter usage however in time made it equivalent to ChiefHarpooneer  In those days the captains authority was restricted tothe navigation and general management of the vessel while over thewhalehunting department and all its concerns the Specksynder orChief Harpooneer reigned supreme  In the British Greenland Fisheryunder the corrupted title of Specksioneer this old Dutch official isstill retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged  At presenthe ranks simply as senior Harpooneer and as such is but one of thecaptains more inferior subalterns  Nevertheless as upon the goodconduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largelydepends and since in the American Fishery he is not only animportant officer in the boat but under certain circumstances nightwatches on a whaling ground the command of the ships deck is alsohis therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands that heshould nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be insome way distinguished as their professional superior though alwaysby them familiarly regarded as their social equalNow the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea isthisthe first lives aft the last forward  Hence in whaleshipsand merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with thecaptain and so too in most of the American whalers the harpooneersare lodged in the after part of the ship  That is to say they taketheir meals in the captains cabin and sleep in a place indirectlycommunicating with itThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage by far thelongest of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perilsof it and the community of interest prevailing among a company allof whom high or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wagesbut upon their common luck together with their common vigilanceintrepidity and hard work though all these things do in some casestend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmengenerally yet never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian familythese whalemen may in some primitive instances live together forall that the punctilious externals at least of the quarterdeckare seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away  Indeedmany are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipperparading his quarterdeck with an elated grandeur not surpassed inany military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as ifhe wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilotclothAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the leastgiven to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the onlyhomage he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience thoughhe required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere steppingupon the quarterdeck and though there were times when owing topeculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to bedetailed he addressed them in unusual terms whether ofcondescension or IN TERROREM or otherwise yet even Captain Ahab wasby no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the seaNor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behindthose forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himselfincidentally making use of them for other and more private ends thanthey were legitimately intended to subserve  That certain sultanismof his brain which had otherwise in a good degree remainedunmanifested through those forms that same sultanism becameincarnate in an irresistible dictatorship  For be a mansintellectual superiority what it will it can never assume thepractical available supremacy over other men without the aid ofsome sort of external arts and entrenchments always in themselvesmore or less paltry and base  This it is that for ever keeps Godstrue princes of the Empire from the worlds hustings and leaves thehighest honours that this air can give to those men who become famousmore through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handfulof the Divine Inert than through their undoubted superiority overthe dead level of the mass  Such large virtue lurks in these smallthings when extreme political superstitions invest them that in someroyal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potencyBut when as in the case of Nicholas the Czar the ringed crown ofgeographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeianherds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization  Nor willthe tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in itsfullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally soimportant in his art as the one now alluded toBut Ahab my Captain still moves before me in all his Nantucketgrimness and shagginess and in this episode touching Emperors andKings I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor oldwhalehunter like him and therefore all outward majesticaltrappings and housings are denied me  Oh Ahab what shall be grandin thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for inthe deep and featured in the unbodied airCHAPTER 34The CabinTableIt is noon and DoughBoy the steward thrusting his paleloafofbread face from the cabinscuttle announces dinner to hislord and master who sitting in the lee quarterboat has just beentaking an observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning thelatitude on the smooth medallionshaped tablet reserved for thatdaily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg  From his completeinattention to the tidings you would think that moody Ahab had notheard his menial  But presently catching hold of the mizen shroudshe swings himself to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voicesaying Dinner Mr Starbuck disappears into the cabinWhen the last echo of his sultans step has died away and Starbuckthe first Emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated thenStarbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along theplanks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with sometouch of pleasantness Dinner Mr Stubb and descends the scuttleThe second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightlyshaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right withthat important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with arapid Dinner Mr Flask follows after his predecessorsBut the third Emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarterdeckseems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping allsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking offhis shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpiperight over the Grand Turks head and then by a dexterous sleightpitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes downrollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deckreversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with musicBut ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a newface altogether and then independent hilarious little Flaskenters King Ahabs presence in the character of Abjectus or theSlaveIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intenseartificialness of seausages that while in the open air of the decksome officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly anddefyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let thosevery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner inthat same commanders cabin and straightway their inoffensive notto say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the headof the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical  Whereforethis difference  A problem  Perhaps not  To have been BelshazzarKing of Babylon and to have been Belshazzar not haughtily butcourteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundanegrandeur  But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spiritpresides over his own private dinnertable of invited guests thatmans unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for thetime that mans royalty of state transcends Belshazzars forBelshazzar was not the greatest  Who has but once dined his friendshas tasted what it is to be Caesar  It is a witchery of socialczarship which there is no withstanding  Now if to thisconsideration you superadd the official supremacy of a shipmasterthen by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity ofsealife just mentionedOver his ivoryinlaid table Ahab presided like a mute manedsealion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike butstill deferential cubs  In his own proper turn each officer waitedto be served  They were as little children before Ahab and yet inAhab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance  Withone mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife ashe carved the chief dish before him  I do not suppose that for theworld they would have profaned that moment with the slightestobservation even upon so neutral a topic as the weather  No  Andwhen reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beefwas locked Ahab thereby motioned Starbucks plate towards him themate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderlyand a little started if perchance the knife grazed against theplate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not withoutcircumspection  For like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort wherethe German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven ImperialElectors so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals eaten inawful silence and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversationonly he himself was dumb  What a relief it was to choking Stubbwhen a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below  And poor littleFlask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary familyparty  His were the shinbones of the saline beef his would havebeen the drumsticks  For Flask to have presumed to help himselfthis must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the firstdegree  Had he helped himself at that table doubtless never morewould he have been able to hold his head up in this honest worldnevertheless strange to say Ahab never forbade him  And had Flaskhelped himself the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticedit  Least of all did Flask presume to help himself to butterWhether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him onaccount of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether hedeemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless waters butterwas at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern howeverit was Flask alas was a butterless manAnother thing  Flask was the last person down at the dinner andFlask is the first man up  Consider  For hereby Flasks dinner wasbadly jammed in point of time  Starbuck and Stubb both had the startof him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rearIf Stubb even who is but a peg higher than Flask happens to havebut a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding hisrepast then Flask must bestir himself he will not get more thanthree mouthfuls that day for it is against holy usage for Stubb toprecede Flask to the deck  Therefore it was that Flask once admittedin private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of anofficer from that moment he had never known what it was to beotherwise than hungry more or less  For what he ate did not so muchrelieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him  Peace andsatisfaction thought Flask have for ever departed from my stomachI am an officer but how I wish I could fish a bit of oldfashionedbeef in the forecastle as I used to when I was before the mastTheres the fruits of promotion now theres the vanity of glorytheres the insanity of life  Besides if it were so that any meresailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flasks officialcapacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain amplevengeance was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at Flaskthrough the cabin skylight sitting silly and dumfoundered beforeawful AhabNow Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the firsttable in the Pequods cabin  After their departure taking place ininverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared orrather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward  Andthen the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being itsresiduary legatees  They made a sort of temporary servants hall ofthe high and mighty cabinIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and namelessinvisible domineerings of the captains table was the entirecarefree license and ease the almost frantic democracy of thoseinferior fellows the harpooneers  While their masters the matesseemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws theharpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was areport to it  They dined like lords they filled their bellies likeIndian ships all day loading with spices  Such portentous appetiteshad Queequeg and Tashtego that to fill out the vacancies made by theprevious repast often the pale DoughBoy was fain to bring on agreat baron of saltjunk seemingly quarried out of the solid oxAnd if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimblehopskipandjump then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way ofaccelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoonwise  Andonce Daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted DoughBoys memoryby snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great emptywooden trencher while Tashtego knife in hand began laying out thecircle preliminary to scalping him  He was naturally a very nervousshuddering sort of little fellow this breadfaced steward theprogeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse  And what with thestanding spectacle of the black terrific Ahab and the periodicaltumultuous visitations of these three savages DoughBoys whole lifewas one continual lipquiver  Commonly after seeing the harpooneersfurnished with all things they demanded he would escape from theirclutches into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out atthem through the blinds of its door till all was overIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego opposinghis filed teeth to the Indians crosswise to them Daggoo seated onthe floor for a bench would have brought his hearseplumed head tothe low carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making thelow cabin framework to shake as when an African elephant goespassenger in a ship  But for all this the great negro waswonderfully abstemious not to say dainty  It seemed hardly possiblethat by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up thevitality diffused through so broad baronial and superb a personBut doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of theabounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed inthe sublime life of the worlds  Not by beef or by bread are giantsmade or nourished  But Queequeg he had a mortal barbaric smack ofthe lip in eatingan ugly sound enoughso much so that thetrembling DoughBoy almost looked to see whether any marks of teethlurked in his own lean arms  And when he would hear Tashtego singingout for him to produce himself that his bones might be picked thesimplewitted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging roundhim in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy  Nor did thewhetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for theirlances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner theywould ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did notat all tend to tranquillize poor DoughBoy  How could he forget thatin his Island days Queequeg for one must certainly have beenguilty of some murderous convivial indiscretions  Alas  DoughBoyhard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals  Not a napkinshould he carry on his arm but a buckler  In good time though tohis great delight the three saltsea warriors would rise and departto his credulous fablemongering ears all their martial bonesjingling in them at every step like Moorish scimetars in scabbardsBut though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally livedthere still being anything but sedentary in their habits they werescarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just beforesleepingtime when they passed through it to their own peculiarquartersIn this one matter Ahab seemed no exception to most American whalecaptains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rightsthe ships cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alonethat anybody else is at any time permitted there  So that in realtruth the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly besaid to have lived out of the cabin than in it  For when they didenter it it was something as a streetdoor enters a house turninginwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and as apermanent thing residing in the open air  Nor did they lose muchhereby in the cabin was no companionship socially Ahab wasinaccessible  Though nominally included in the census ofChristendom he was still an alien to it  He lived in the world asthe last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri  And as whenSpring and Summer had departed that wild Logan of the woods buryinghimself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there suckinghis own paws so in his inclement howling old age Ahabs soulshut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullenpaws of its gloomCHAPTER 35The MastHeadIt was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation withthe other seamen my first masthead came roundIn most American whalemen the mastheads are manned almostsimultaneously with the vessels leaving her port even though shemay have fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching herproper cruising ground  And if after a three four or five yearsvoyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in hersay anempty vial eventhen her mastheads are kept manned to the lastand not till her skysailpoles sail in among the spires of the portdoes she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale moreNow as the business of standing mastheads ashore or afloat is avery ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiatehere  I take it that the earliest standers of mastheads were theold Egyptians because in all my researches I find none prior tothem  For though their progenitors the builders of Babel mustdoubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiestmasthead in all Asia or Africa either yet ere the final truck wasput to it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to havegone by the board in the dread gale of Gods wrath therefore wecannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians  Andthat the Egyptians were a nation of masthead standers is anassertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists thatthe first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes a theorysingularly supported by the peculiar stairlike formation of all foursides of those edifices whereby with prodigious long upliftings oftheir legs those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex andsing out for new stars even as the lookouts of a modern ship singout for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight  In Saint Stylitesthe famous Christian hermit of old times who built him a lofty stonepillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his lifeon its summit hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle inhim we have a remarkable instance of a dauntlessstanderofmastheads who was not to be driven from his place byfogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everythingout to the last literally died at his post  Of modernstandersofmastheads we have but a lifeless set mere stone ironand bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff galeare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upondiscovering any strange sight  There is Napoleon who upon the topof the column of Vendome stands with arms folded some one hundredand fifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks belowwhether Louis Philippe Louis Blanc or Louis the Devil  GreatWashington too stands high aloft on his towering mainmast inBaltimore and like one of Hercules pillars his column marks thatpoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go  AdmiralNelson also on a capstan of gunmetal stands his masthead inTrafalgar Square and ever when most obscured by that London smoketoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there issmoke must be fire  But neither great Washington nor Napoleon norNelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invokedto befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which theygaze however it may be surmised that their spirits penetratethrough the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals and whatrocks must be shunnedIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mastheadstanders of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it isnot so is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy the solehistorian of Nantucket stands accountable  The worthy Obed tellsus that in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships wereregularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that islanderected lofty spars along the seacoast to which the lookoutsascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs ina henhouse  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Baywhalemen of New Zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice tothe readymanned boats nigh the beach  But this custom has nowbecome obsolete turn we then to the one proper masthead that of awhaleship at sea  The three mastheads are kept manned fromsunrise to sunset the seamen taking their regular turns as at thehelm and relieving each other every two hours  In the sereneweather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the masthead nayto a dreamy meditative man it is delightful  There you stand ahundred feet above the silent decks striding along the deep as ifthe masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and between yourlegs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as shipsonce sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old RhodesThere you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothingruffled but the waves  The tranced ship indolently rolls the drowsytrade winds blow everything resolves you into languor  For the mostpart in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness investsyou you hear no news read no gazettes extras with startlingaccounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessaryexcitements you hear of no domestic afflictions bankruptsecurities fall of stocks are never troubled with the thought ofwhat you shall have for dinnerfor all your meals for three yearsand more are snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare isimmutableIn one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four yearsvoyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend atthe masthead would amount to several entire months  And it is muchto be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable aportion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadlydestitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness oradapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such as pertainsto a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach orany other of those small and snug contrivances in which mentemporarily isolate themselves  Your most usual point of perch isthe head of the t gallantmast where you stand upon two thinparallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen called the t gallantcrosstrees  Here tossed about by the sea the beginner feels aboutas cosy as he would standing on a bulls horns  To be sure in coldweather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of awatchcoat but properly speaking the thickest watchcoat is no moreof a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside ofits fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor evenmove out of it without running great risk of perishing like anignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter so a watchcoatis not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope or additionalskin encasing you  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers inyour body and no more can you make a convenient closet of yourwatchcoatConcerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads ofa southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tentsor pulpits called CROWSNESTS in which the lookouts of aGreenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of thefrozen seas  In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet entitledA Voyage among the Icebergs in quest of the Greenland Whale andincidentally for the rediscovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies ofOld Greenland in this admirable volume all standers of mastheadsare furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the thenrecently invented CROWSNEST of the Glacier which was the name ofCaptain Sleets good craft  He called it the SLEETS CROWSNEST inhonour of himself he being the original inventor and patentee andfree from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we callour own children after our own names we fathers being the originalinventors and patentees so likewise should we denominate afterourselves any other apparatus we may beget  In shape the Sleetscrowsnest is something like a large tierce or pipe it is openabove however where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen tokeep to windward of your head in a hard gale  Being fixed on thesummit of the mast you ascend into it through a little traphatch inthe bottom  On the after side or side next the stern of the shipis a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellascomforters and coats  In front is a leather rack in which to keepyour speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nauticalconveniences  When Captain Sleet in person stood his masthead inthis crowsnest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle withhim also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shotfor the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales or vagrant seaunicorns infesting those waters for you cannot successfully shoot atthem from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shootdown upon them is a very different thing  Now it was plainly alabor of love for Captain Sleet to describe as he does all thelittle detailed conveniences of his crowsnest but though he soenlarges upon many of these and though he treats us to a veryscientific account of his experiments in this crowsnest with asmall compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting theerrors resulting from what is called the local attraction of allbinnacle magnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity ofthe iron in the ships planks and in the Glaciers case perhaps tothere having been so many brokendown blacksmiths among her crew Isay that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific hereyet for all his learned binnacle deviations azimuth compassobservations and approximate errors he knows very well CaptainSleet that he was not so much immersed in those profound magneticmeditations as to fail being attracted occasionally towards thatwell replenished little casebottle so nicely tucked in on one sideof his crows nest within easy reach of his hand  Though upon thewhole I greatly admire and even love the brave the honest andlearned Captain yet I take it very ill of him that he should soutterly ignore that casebottle seeing what a faithful friend andcomforter it must have been while with mittened fingers and hoodedhead he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that birds nestwithin three or four perches of the poleBut if we Southern whalefishers are not so snugly housed aloft asCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage isgreatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of thoseseductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float  For one Iused to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top tohave a chat with Queequeg or any one else off duty whom I might findthere then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy legover the topsail yard take a preliminary view of the waterypastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destinationLet me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that I keptbut sorry guard  With the problem of the universe revolving in mehow could Ibeing left completely to myself at such athoughtengendering altitudehow could I but lightly hold myobligations to observe all whaleships standing orders Keep yourweather eye open and sing out every timeAnd let me in this place movingly admonish you ye shipowners ofNantucket  Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any ladwith lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativenessand who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in hishead  Beware of such an one I say your whales must be seen beforethey can be killed and this sunkeneyed young Platonist will tow youten wakes round the world and never make you one pint of sperm thericher  Nor are these monitions at all unneeded  For nowadays thewhalefishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy andabsentminded young men disgusted with the carking cares of earthand seeking sentiment in tar and blubber  Childe Harold notunfrequently perches himself upon the masthead of some lucklessdisappointed whaleship and in moody phrase ejaculatesRoll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll  Ten thousandblubberhunters sweep over thee in vainVery often do the captains of such ships take those absentmindedyoung philosophers to task upbraiding them with not feelingsufficient interest in the voyage halfhinting that they are sohopelessly lost to all honourable ambition as that in their secretsouls they would rather not see whales than otherwise  But all invain those young Platonists have a notion that their vision isimperfect they are shortsighted what use then to strain thevisual nerve  They have left their operaglasses at homeWhy thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads wevebeen cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised awhale yet  Whales are scarce as hens teeth whenever thou art uphere  Perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals ofthem in the far horizon but lulled into such an opiumlikelistlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absentmindedyouth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts that at last heloses his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for thevisible image of that deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankindand nature and every strange halfseen gliding beautiful thingthat eludes him every dimlydiscovered uprising fin of someundiscernible form seems to him the embodiment of those elusivethoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting throughit  In this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs away to whence it camebecomes diffused through time and space like Crammers sprinkledPantheistic ashes forming at last a part of every shore the roundglobe overThere is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by agently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea fromthe inscrutable tides of God  But while this sleep this dream is onye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and youridentity comes back in horror  Over Descartian vortices you hoverAnd perhaps at midday in the fairest weather with onehalfthrottled shriek you drop through that transparent air into thesummer sea no more to rise for ever  Heed it well ye PantheistsCHAPTER 36The QuarterDeckENTER AHAB THEN ALLIt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that onemorning shortly after breakfast Ahab as was his wont ascended thecabingangway to the deck  There most seacaptains usually walk atthat hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a fewturns in the gardenSoon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced hisold rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were allover dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of hiswalk  Did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented browthere also you would see still stranger footprintsthe footprintsof his one unsleeping everpacing thoughtBut on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even ashis nervous step that morning left a deeper mark  And so full ofhis thought was Ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now atthe mainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see thatthought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced socompletely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inwardmould of every outer movementDye mark him Flask whispered Stubb the chick thats in himpecks the shell  Twill soon be outThe hours wore onAhab now shut up within his cabin anon pacingthe deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspectIt drew near the close of day  Suddenly he came to a halt by thebulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the augerhole there andwith one hand grasping a shroud he ordered Starbuck to sendeverybody aftSir said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given onshipboard except in some extraordinary caseSend everybody aft repeated Ahab  Mastheads there come downWhen the entire ships company were assembled and with curious andnot wholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked notunlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up Ahab afterrapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes amongthe crew started from his standpoint and as though not a soul werenigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck  With bent head andhalfslouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wonderingwhispering among the men till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flaskthat Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessinga pedestrian feat  But this did not last long  Vehemently pausinghe criedWhat do ye do when ye see a whale menSing out for him was the impulsive rejoinder from a score ofclubbed voicesGood cried Ahab with a wild approval in his tones observing thehearty animation into which his unexpected question had somagnetically thrown themAnd what do ye next menLower away and after himAnd what tune is it ye pull to menA dead whale or a stove boatMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew thecountenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners beganto gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was thatthey themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposelessquestionsBut they were all eagerness again as Ahab now halfrevolving inhis pivothole with one hand reaching high up a shroud and tightlyalmost convulsively grasping it addressed them thusAll ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about awhite whale  Look ye dye see this Spanish ounce of goldholdingup a broad bright coin to the sunit is a sixteen dollar piecemen  Dye see it  Mr Starbuck hand me yon topmaulWhile the mate was getting the hammer Ahab without speaking wasslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as ifto heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhilelowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled andinarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels ofhis vitality in himReceiving the topmaul from Starbuck he advanced towards themainmast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the goldwith the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming Whosoeverof ye raises me a whiteheaded whale with a wrinkled brow and acrooked jaw whosoever of ye raises me that whiteheaded whale withthree holes punctured in his starboard flukelook ye whosoever ofye raises me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce myboysHuzza huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins theyhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mastIts a white whale I say resumed Ahab as he threw down thetopmaul a white whale  Skin your eyes for him men look sharp forwhite water if ye see but a bubble sing outAll this while Tashtego Daggoo and Queequeg had looked on with evenmore intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mentionof the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each wasseparately touched by some specific recollectionCaptain Ahab said Tashtego that white whale must be the samethat some call Moby DickMoby Dick shouted Ahab  Do ye know the white whale then TashDoes he fantail a little curious sir before he goes down saidthe GayHeader deliberatelyAnd has he a curious spout too said Daggoo very bushy even fora parmacetty and mighty quick Captain AhabAnd he have one two threeoh good many iron in him hide tooCaptain cried Queequeg disjointedly all twisketee betwisk likehimhim faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand roundand round as though uncorking a bottlelike himhimCorkscrew cried Ahab aye Queequeg the harpoons lie all twistedand wrenched in him aye Daggoo his spout is a big one like awhole shock of wheat and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool afterthe great annual sheepshearing aye Tashtego and he fantails likea split jib in a squall  Death and devils men it is Moby Dick yehave seenMoby DickMoby DickCaptain Ahab said Starbuck who with Stubb and Flask had thusfar been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at lastseemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonderCaptain Ahab I have heard of Moby Dickbut it was not Moby Dickthat took off thy legWho told thee that cried Ahab then pausing Aye Starbuck ayemy hearties all round it was Moby Dick that dismasted me Moby Dickthat brought me to this dead stump I stand on now  Aye aye heshouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of aheartstricken moose Aye aye it was that accursed white whalethat razeed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a dayThen tossing both arms with measureless imprecations he shoutedout Aye aye and Ill chase him round Good Hope and round theHorn and round the Norway Maelstrom and round perditions flamesbefore I give him up  And this is what ye have shipped for men tochase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides ofearth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out  What say yemen will ye splice hands on it now  I think ye do look braveAye aye shouted the harpooneers and seamen running closer to theexcited old man A sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance forMoby DickGod bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout  God bless yemen  Steward go draw the great measure of grog  But whats thislong face about Mr Starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whaleart not game for Moby DickI am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of Death tooCaptain Ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business wefollow but I came here to hunt whales not my commanders vengeanceHow many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettestit Captain Ahab it will not fetch thee much in our NantucketmarketNantucket market  Hoot  But come closer Starbuck thou requiresta little lower layer  If moneys to be the measurer man and theaccountants have computed their great countinghouse the globe bygirdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch thenlet me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HEREHe smites his chest whispered Stubb whats that for methinks itrings most vast but hollowVengeance on a dumb brute cried Starbuck that simply smote theefrom blindest

livingact the undoubted deedthere some unknown but still reasoningthing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind theunreasoning mask  If man will strike strike through the mask  Howcan the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wallTo me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me  Sometimes Ithink theres naught beyond  But tis enough  He tasks me he heapsme I see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malicesinewing it  That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate and bethe white whale agent or be the white whale principal I will wreakthat hate upon him  Talk not to me of blasphemy man Id strike thesun if it insulted me  For could the sun do that then could I dothe other since there is ever a sort of fair play herein jealousypresiding over all

my heat has melted thee to angerglowBut look ye Starbuck what is said in heat that thing unsaysitself  There are men from whom warm words are small indignity  Imeant not to incense thee  Let it go  Look see yonder Turkishcheeks of spotted tawnliving breathing pictures painted by thesun  The Pagan leopardsthe unrecking and unworshipping thingsthat live and seek and give no reasons for the torrid

ASIDE Something shot from mydilated nostrils he has inhaled it in his lungs  Starbuck now ismine cannot oppose me now without rebellionGod keep mekeep us all murmured Starbuck lowlyBut in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate Ahabdid not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh fromthe hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in thecordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts asfor a moment their hearts sank in  For again Starbucks downcasteyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean laughdied away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heavedand rolled as before  Ah ye admonitions and warnings why stay yenot when ye come  But rather are ye predictions than warnings yeshadows  Yet not so much predictions from without as verificationsof the foregoing things within  For with little external toconstrain us the innermost necessities in our being these stilldrive us onThe measure the measure cried AhabReceiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers heordered them to produce their weapons  Then ranging them before himnear the capstan with their harpoons in their hands while his threemates stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the shipscompany formed a circle round the group he stood for an instantsearchingly eyeing every man of his crew  But those wild eyes

radiating lances at their crossed centre while sodoing suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancingintently from Starbuck to Stubb from Stubb to Flask  It seemed asthough by some nameless interior volition he would fain haveshocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within theLeyden jar of his own magnetic life  The three mates quailed beforehis strong sustained and mystic

clinch my oath because of the dread in mysoul  A wild mystical sympathetical feeling was in me Ahabsquenchless feud seemed mine  With greedy ears I learned the historyof that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had takenour oaths of violence and revengeFor some time past though at intervals only the unaccompaniedsecluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostlyfrequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen  But not all of them knew ofhis existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seenhim while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly givenbattle to him was small indeed  For owing to the large number ofwhalecruisers the disorderly way they were sprinkled over theentire watery circumference many of them adventurously pushing theirquest along solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a wholetwelvemonth or more on a stretch to encounter a single newstellingsail of any sort the inordinate length of each separate voyage theirregularity of the times of sailing from home all these with othercircumstances direct and indirect long obstructed the spreadthrough the whole worldwide whalingfleet of the specialindividualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick  It was hardly to bedoubted that several vessels reported to have encountered at suchor such a time or on such or such a meridian a Sperm Whale ofuncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after doing greatmischief to his assailants had completely escaped them to someminds it was not an unfair presumption I say that the whale inquestion must have been no other than Moby Dick  Yet as of late theSperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequentinstances of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monsterattacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantlygave battle to Moby Dick such hunters perhaps for the most partwere content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more as itwere to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large than to theindividual cause  In that way mostly the disastrous encounterbetween Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regardedAnd as for those who previously hearing of the White Whale bychance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they hadevery one of them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for himas for any other whale of that species  But at length suchcalamities did ensue in these assaultsnot restricted to sprainedwrists and ankles broken limbs or devouring amputationsbut fatalto the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulsesall accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick thosethings had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters towhom the story of the White Whale had eventually comeNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still themore horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters  For notonly do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of allsurprising terrible eventsas the smitten tree gives birth to itsfungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firmawild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for themto cling to  And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter sothe whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in thewonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulatethere  For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from thatignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of allsailors they are by all odds the most directly brought into contactwith whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to facethey not only eye its greatest marvels but hand to jaw give battleto them  Alone in such remotest waters that though you sailed athousand miles and passed a thousand shores you would not come toany chiseled hearthstone or aught hospitable beneath that part ofthe sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too such acalling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tendingto make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birthNo wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transitover the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the White Whaledid in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbidhints and halfformed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencieswhich eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed fromanything that visibly appears  So that in many cases such a panicdid he finally strike that few who by those rumors at least hadheard of the White Whale few of those hunters were willing toencounter the perils of his jawBut there were still other and more vital practical influences atwork  Not even at the present day has the original prestige of theSperm Whale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of theleviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body  Thereare those this day among them who though intelligent and courageousenough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale wouldperhapseither from professional inexperience or incompetency ortimidity decline a contest with the Sperm Whale at any rate thereare plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nations notsailing under the American flag who have never hostilely encounteredthe Sperm Whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan isrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the Northseated on their hatches these men will hearken with a childishfireside interest and awe to the wild strange tales of Southernwhaling  Nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great SpermWhale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of thoseprows which stem himAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendarytimes thrown its shadow before it we find some booknaturalistsOlassen and Povelsondeclaring the Sperm Whale not onlyto be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also tobe so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for humanblood  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuviers were these oralmost similar impressions effaced  For in his Natural History theBaron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale all fishsharks included are struck with the most lively terrors andoften in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves againstthe rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death  Andhowever the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reportsas these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirstyitem of Povelson the superstitious belief in them is in somevicissitudes of their vocation revived in the minds of the huntersSo that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a fewof the fishermen recalled in reference to Moby Dick the earlierdays of the Sperm Whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard toinduce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of thisnew and daring warfare such men protesting that although otherleviathans might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lanceat such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal manThat to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quicketernity  On this head there are some remarkable documents that maybe consultedNevertheless some there were who even in the face of these thingswere ready to give chase to Moby Dick and a still greater numberwho chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without thespecific details of any certain calamity and without superstitiousaccompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battleif offeredOne of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to belinked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiouslyinclined was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitousthat he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at oneand the same instant of timeNor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceitaltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability  Foras the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet beendivulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden ways ofthe Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain in great partunaccountable to his pursuers and from time to time have originatedthe most curious and contradictory speculations regarding themespecially concerning the mystic modes whereby after sounding to agreat depth he transports himself with such vast swiftness to themost widely distant pointsIt is a thing well known to both American and English whaleshipsand as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago byScoresby that some whales have been captured far north in thePacific in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons dartedin the Greenland seas  Nor is it to be gainsaid that in some ofthese instances it has been declared that the interval of timebetween the two assaults could not have exceeded very many daysHence by inference it has been believed by some whalemen that theNor West Passage so long a problem to man was never a problem tothe whale  So that here in the real living experience of livingmen the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strellomountain in Portugal near whose top there was said to be a lake inwhich the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface and that stillmore wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse whosewaters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by anunderground passage these fabulous narrations are almost fullyequalled by the realities of the whalemenForced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these andknowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the White Whale hadescaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that somewhalemen should go still further in their superstitions declaringMoby Dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is butubiquity in time that though groves of spears should be planted inhis flanks he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he shouldever be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but aghastly deception for again in unensanguined billows hundreds ofleagues away his unsullied jet would once more be seenBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enoughin the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster tostrike the imagination with unwonted power  For it was not so muchhis uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other spermwhales but as was elsewhere thrown outa peculiar snowwhitewrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump  These werehis prominent features the tokens whereby even in the limitlessuncharted seas he revealed his identity at a long distance tothose who knew himThe rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled withthe same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained hisdistinctive appellation of the White Whale a name indeed literallyjustified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon througha dark blue sea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam allspangled with golden gleamingsNor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yethis deformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with naturalterror as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according tospecific accounts he had over and over again evinced in hisassaults  More than all his treacherous retreats struck more ofdismay than perhaps aught else  For when swimming before hisexulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm he hadseveral times been known to turn round suddenly and bearing downupon them either stave their boats to splinters or drive them backin consternation to their shipAlready several fatalities had attended his chase  But thoughsimilar disasters however little bruited ashore were by no meansunusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the WhiteWhales infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering ordeath that he caused was not wholly regarded as having beeninflicted by an unintelligent agentJudge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the mindsof his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips ofchewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam outof the white curds of the whales direful wrath into the sereneexasperating sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridalHis three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling inthe eddies one captain seizing the lineknife from his broken prowhad dashed at the whale as an Arkansas duellist at his foe blindlyseeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathomdeep life of thewhale  That captain was Ahab  And then it was that suddenlysweeping his sickleshaped lower jaw beneath him Moby Dick hadreaped away Ahabs leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field  Noturbaned Turk no hired Venetian or Malay could have smote him withmore seeming malice  Small reason was there to doubt then thatever since that almost fatal encounter Ahab had cherished a wildvindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in hisfrantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only allhis bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritualexasperations  The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniacincarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feeleating in them till they are left living on with half a heart andhalf a lung  That intangible malignity which has been from thebeginning to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribeonehalf of the worlds which the ancient Ophites of the eastreverenced in their statue devilAhab did not fall down and worshipit like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorredwhite whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it  All thatmost maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things alltruth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes thebrain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil tocrazy Ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailablein Moby Dick  He piled upon the whales white hump the sum of allthe general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down andthen as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot heartsshell upon itIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant riseat the precise time of his bodily dismemberment  Then in darting atthe monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a suddenpassionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke thattore him he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration butnothing more  Yet when by this collision forced to turn towardshome and for long months of days and weeks Ahab and anguish laystretched together in one hammock rounding in mid winter thatdreary howling Patagonian Cape then it was that his torn body andgashed soul bled into one another and so interfusing made him madThat it was only then on the homeward voyage after the encounterthat the final monomania seized him seems all but certain from thefact that at intervals during the passage he was a raving lunaticand though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital strength yet lurked inhis Egyptian chest and was moreover intensified by his deliriumthat his mates were forced to lace him fast even there as hesailed raving in his hammock  In a straitjacket he swung to themad rockings of the gales  And when running into more sufferablelatitudes the ship with mild stunsails spread floated across thetranquil tropics and to all appearances the old mans deliriumseemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells and he came forthfrom his dark den into the blessed light and air even then when hebore that firm collected front however pale and issued his calmorders once again and his mates thanked God the direful madness wasnow gone even then Ahab in his hidden self raved on  Humanmadness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing  When youthink it fled it may have but become transfigured into some stillsubtler form  Ahabs full lunacy subsided not but deepeninglycontracted like the unabated Hudson when that noble Northman flowsnarrowly but unfathomably through the Highland gorge  But as inhis narrowflowing monomania not one jot of Ahabs broad madness hadbeen left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his greatnatural intellect had perished  That before living agent now becamethe living instrument  If such a furious trope may stand hisspecial lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it and turnedall its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far fromhaving lost his strength Ahab to that one end did now possess athousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bearupon any one reasonable objectThis is much yet Ahabs larger darker deeper part remainsunhinted  But vain to popularize profundities and all truth isprofound  Winding far down from within the very heart of this spikedHotel de Cluny where we here standhowever grand and wonderful nowquit itand take your way ye nobler sadder souls to those vastRoman halls of Thermes where far beneath the fantastic towers ofmans upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful essence sitsin bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquities and thronedon torsoes  So with a broken throne the great gods mock thatcaptive king so like a Caryatid he patient sits upholding on hisfrozen brow the piled entablatures of ages  Wind ye down there yeprouder sadder souls question that proud sad king  A familylikeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and fromyour grim sire only will the old Statesecret comeNow in his heart Ahab had some glimpse of this namely all mymeans are sane my motive and my object mad  Yet without power tokill or change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankindhe did long dissemble in some sort did still  But that thing ofhis dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility not to hiswill determinate  Nevertheless so well did he succeed in thatdissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last noNantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved andthat to the quick with the terrible casualty which had overtakenhimThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularlyascribed to a kindred cause  And so too all the added moodinesswhich always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the Pequod onthe present voyage sat brooding on his brow  Nor is it so veryunlikely that far from distrusting his fitness for another whalingvoyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people ofthat prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for thosevery reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge for apursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whalesGnawed within and scorched without with the infixed unrelentingfangs of some incurable idea such an one could he be found wouldseem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against themost appalling of all brutes  Or if for any reason thought to becorporeally incapacitated for that yet such an one would seemsuperlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to theattack  But be all this as it may certain it is that with the madsecret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him Ahab hadpurposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only andallengrossing object of hunting the White Whale  Had any one of hisold acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking inhim then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls havewrenched the ship from such a fiendish man  They were bent onprofitable cruises the profit to be counted down in dollars from themint  He was intent on an audacious immitigable and supernaturalrevengeHere then was this greyheaded ungodly old man chasing withcurses a Jobs whale round the world at the head of a crew toochiefly made up of mongrel renegades and castaways andcannibalsmorally enfeebled also by the incompetence of mereunaided virtue or rightmindedness in Starbuck the invunerablejollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb and the pervadingmediocrity in Flask  Such a crew so officered seemed

Whiteness of The WhaleWhat the white whale was to Ahab has been hinted what at times hewas to me as yet remains unsaidAside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dickwhich could not but occasionally awaken in any mans soul some alarmthere was another thought or rather vague nameless horrorconcerning him which at times by its intensity completelyoverpowered all the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffablewas it that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible formIt was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled meBut how can I hope to explain myself here and yet in some dimrandom way explain myself I must else all these chapters might benaughtThough in many natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beautyas if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marblesjaponicas and pearls and though various nations have in some wayrecognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even thebarbaric grand old kings of Pegu placing the title Lord of theWhite Elephants above all their other magniloquent ascriptions ofdominion and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snowwhitequadruped in the royal standard and the Hanoverian flag bearing theone figure of a snowwhite charger and the great Austrian EmpireCaesarian heir to overlording Rome having for the imperial colourthe same imperial hue and though this preeminence in it applies tothe human race itself giving the white man ideal mastership overevery dusky tribe and though besides all this whiteness has beeneven made significant of gladness for among the Romans a white stonemarked a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathies andsymbolizings this same hue is made the emblem of many touchingnoble thingsthe innocence of brides the benignity of age thoughamong the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampumwas the deepest pledge of honour though in many climes whitenesstypifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge andcontributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn bymilkwhite steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the mostaugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divinespotlessness and power by the Persian fire worshippers the whiteforked flame being held the holiest on the altar and in the Greekmythologies Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snowwhitebull and though to the noble Iroquois the midwinter sacrifice ofthe sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of theirtheology that spotless faithful creature being held the purestenvoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings oftheir own fidelity and though directly from the Latin word forwhite all Christian priests derive the name of one part of theirsacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the cassock andthough among the holy pomps of the Romish faith white is speciallyemployed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord though in theVision of St John white robes are given to the redeemed and thefourandtwenty elders stand clothed in white before the greatwhitethrone and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool yet forall these accumulated associations with whatever is sweet andhonourable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in theinnermost idea of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soulthan that redness which affrights in bloodThis elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whitenesswhen divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with anyobject terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthestbounds  Witness the white bear of the poles and the white shark ofthe tropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them thetranscendent horrors they are  That ghastly whiteness it is whichimparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome thanterrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect  So that not thefiercefanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage asthe whiteshrouded bear or sharkWith reference to the Polar bear it may possibly be urged by himwho would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not thewhiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerablehideousness of that brute for analysed that heightenedhideousness it might be said only rises from the circumstance thatthe irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested inthe fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringingtogether two such opposite emotions in our minds the Polar bearfrightens us with so unnatural a contrast  But even assuming allthis to be true yet were it not for the whiteness you would nothave that intensified terrorAs for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose inthat creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallieswith the same quality in the Polar quadruped  This peculiarity ismost vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon thatfish  The Romish mass for the dead begins with Requiem eternameternal rest whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself and anyother funeral music  Now in allusion to the white silent stillnessof death in this shark and the mild deadliness of his habits theFrench call him REQUINBethink thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritualwonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sails in allimaginations  Not Coleridge first threw that spell but Gods greatunflattering laureate NatureI remember the first albatross I ever saw  It was during aprolonged gale in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas  From myforenoon watch below I ascended to the overclouded deck and theredashed upon the main hatches I saw a regal feathery thing ofunspotted whiteness and with a hooked Roman bill sublime  Atintervals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if to embracesome holy ark  Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it  Thoughbodily unharmed it uttered cries as some kings ghost insupernatural distress  Through its inexpressible strange eyesmethought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God  As Abrahambefore the angels I bowed myself the white thing was so white itswings so wide and in those for ever exiled waters I had lost themiserable warping memories of traditions and of towns  Long I gazedat that prodigy of plumage  I cannot tell can only hint the thingsthat darted through me then  But at last I awoke and turning askeda sailor what bird was this  A goney he replied  Goney never hadheard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing isutterly unknown to men ashore never  But some time after I learnedthat goney was some seamans name for albatross  So that by nopossibility could Coleridges wild Rhyme have had aught to do withthose mystical impressions which were mine when I saw that bird uponour deck  For neither had I then read the Rhyme nor knew the birdto be an albatross  Yet in saying this I do but indirectly burnisha little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poetI assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the birdchiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced inthis that by a solecism of terms there are birds called greyalbatrosses and these I have frequently seen but never with suchemotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowlBut how had the mystic thing been caught  Whisper it not and I willtell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl floated on thesea  At last the Captain made a postman of it tying a letteredleathern tally round its neck with the ships time and place andthen letting it escape  But I doubt not that leathern tally meantfor man was taken off in Heaven when the white fowl flew to jointhe wingfolding the invoking and adoring cherubimMost famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that ofthe White Steed of the Prairies a magnificent milkwhite chargerlargeeyed smallheaded bluffchested and with the dignity of athousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning carriage  He was theelected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in thosedays were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies  Attheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star whichevery evening leads on the hosts of light  The flashing cascade ofhis mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housingsmore resplendent than gold and silverbeaters could have furnishedhim  A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallenwestern world which to the eyes of the old trappers and huntersrevived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majesticas a god bluffbrowed and fearless as this mighty steed  Whethermarching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohortsthat endlessly streamed it over the plains like an Ohio or whetherwith his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizonthe White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrilsreddening through his cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presentedhimself always to the bravest Indians he was the object of tremblingreverence and awe  Nor can it be questioned from what stands onlegendary record of this noble horse that it was his spiritualwhiteness chiefly which so clothed him with divineness and thatthis divineness had that in it which though commanding worship atthe same time enforced a certain nameless terrorBut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all thataccessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed andAlbatrossWhat is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and oftenshocks the eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith andkin  It is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed bythe name he bears  The Albino is as well made as other menhas nosubstantive deformityand yet this mere aspect of allpervadingwhiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortionWhy should this be soNor in quite other aspects does Nature in her least palpable butnot the less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces thiscrowning attribute of the terrible  From its snowy aspect thegauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the WhiteSquall  Nor in some historic instances has the art of human maliceomitted so potent an auxiliary  How wildly it heightens the effectof that passage in Froissart when masked in the snowy symbol oftheir faction the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder theirbailiff in the marketplaceNor in some things does the common hereditary experience of allmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue  Itcannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect ofthe dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingeringthere as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge ofconsternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here  Andfrom that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of theshroud in which we wrap them  Nor even in our superstitions do wefail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghostsrising in a milkwhite fogYea while these terrors seize us let usadd that even the king of terrors when personified by theevangelist rides on his pallid horseTherefore in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or graciousthing he will by whiteness no man can deny that in its profoundestidealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soulBut though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man toaccount for it  To analyse it would seem impossible  Can wethen by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thingof whitenessthough for the time either wholly or in great partstripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aughtfearful but nevertheless is found to exert over us the samesorcery however modifiedcan we thus hope to light upon somechance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seekLet us try  But in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtletyand without imagination no man can follow another into these hallsAnd though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressionsabout to be presented may have been shared by most men yet fewperhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and thereforemay not be able to recall them nowWhy to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but looselyacquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the baremention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long drearyspeechless processions of slowpacing pilgrims downcast and hoodedwith newfallen snow  Or to the unread unsophisticated Protestantof the Middle American States why does the passing mention of aWhite Friar or a White Nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soulOr what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors andkings which will not wholly account for it that makes the WhiteTower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of anuntravelled American than those other storied structures itsneighborsthe Byward Tower or even the Bloody  And those sublimertowers the White Mountains of New Hampshire whence in peculiarmoods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the baremention of that name while the thought of Virginias Blue Ridge isfull of a soft dewy distant dreaminess  Or why irrespective ofall latitudes and longitudes does the name of the White Sea exertsuch a spectralness over the fancy while that of the Yellow Sealulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons onthe waves followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsetsOr to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed tothe fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europedoes the tall pale man of the Hartz forests whose changelesspallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groveswhy isthis phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of theBlocksburgNor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedraltopplingearthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor thetearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of herwide field of leaning spires wrenched copestones and crosses alladroop like canted yards of anchored fleets and her suburbanavenues of housewalls lying over upon each other as a tossed packof cardsit is not these things alone which make tearless Lima thestrangest saddest city thou canst see  For Lima has taken thewhite veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of herwoe  Old as Pizarro this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever newadmits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spreads over herbroken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its owndistortionsI know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whitenessis not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror ofobjects otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is thereaught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mindalmost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially whenexhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness oruniversality  What I mean by these two statements may perhaps berespectively elucidated by the following examplesFirst The mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands ifby night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feelsjust enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but underprecisely similar circumstances let him be called from his hammockto view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milkywhitenessas if from encircling headlands shoals of combed whitebears were swimming round him then he feels a silent superstitiousdread the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to himas a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he is still offsoundings heart and helm they both go down he never rests till bluewater is under him again  Yet where is the mariner who will tellthee Sir it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks asthe fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred meSecond To the native Indian of Peru the continual sight of thesnowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in themere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at suchvast altitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness itwould be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes  Much the same isit with the backwoodsman of the West who with comparativeindifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow noshadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness  Notso the sailor beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas where attimes by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frostand air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbowsspeaking hope and solace to his misery views what seems a boundlesschurchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments andsplintered crossesBut thou sayest methinks that whitelead chapter about whiteness isbut a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to ahypo IshmaelTell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valleyof Vermont far removed from all beasts of preywhy is it that uponthe sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind himso that he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animalmuskinesswhy will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw theground in phrensies of affright  There is no remembrance in him ofany gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home so that thestrange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associatedwith the experience of former perils for what knows he this NewEngland colt of the black bisons of distant OregonNo but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of theknowledge of the demonism in the world  Though thousands of milesfrom Oregon still when he smells that savage musk the rendinggoring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of theprairies which this instant they may be trampling into dustThus then the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlingsof the festooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of thewindrowed snows of prairies all these to Ishmael are as theshaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened coltThough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which themystic sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the coltsomewhere those things must exist  Though in many of its aspectsthis visible world seems formed in love the invisible spheres wereformed in frightBut not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness andlearned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strangeand far more portentouswhy as we have seen it is at once the mostmeaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of theChristians Deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agentin things the most appalling to mankindIs it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voidsand immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind withthe thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of themilky way  Or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much acolour as the visible absence of colour and at the same time theconcrete of all colours is it for these reasons that there is such adumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snowsacolourless allcolour of atheism from which we shrink  And when weconsider that other theory of the natural philosophers that allother earthly huesevery stately or lovely emblazoningthe sweettinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gilded velvets ofbutterflies and the butterfly cheeks of young girls all these arebut subtile deceits not actually inherent in substances but onlylaid on from without so that all deified Nature absolutely paintslike the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but thecharnelhouse within and when we proceed further and consider thatthe mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues the greatprinciple of light for ever remains white or colourless in itselfand if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objectseven tulips

bucketCHAPTER 44The ChartHad you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squallthat took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of hispurpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in thetransom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish seacharts spread them before him on his screweddown table  Thenseating himself before it you would have seen him intently study thevarious lines and shadings which there met his eye and with slow butsteady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before wereblank  At intervals he would refer to piles of old logbooks besidehim wherein were set down the seasons and places in which onvarious former voyages of various ships sperm whales had beencaptured or seenWhile thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains overhis head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and forever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkledbrow till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking outlines and courses on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil wasalso tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of hisforeheadBut it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of hiscabin Ahab thus pondered over his charts  Almost every night theywere brought out almost every night some pencil marks were effacedand others were substituted  For with the charts of all four oceansbefore him Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with aview to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought ofhis soulNow to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathansit might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitarycreature in the unhooped oceans of this planet  But not so did itseem to Ahab who knew the sets of all tides and currents andthereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whales food andalso calling to mind the regular ascertained seasons for huntinghim in particular latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmisesalmost approaching to certainties concerning the timeliest day to beupon this or that ground in search of his preySo assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of thesperm whales resorting to given waters that many hunters believethat could he be closely observed and studied throughout the worldwere the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefullycollated then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found tocorrespond in invariability to those of the herringshoals or theflights of swallows  On this hint attempts have been made toconstruct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whaleSince the above was written the statement is happily borne out byan official circular issued by Lieutenant Maury of the NationalObservatory Washington April 16th 1851  By that circular itappears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion andportions of it are presented in the circular  This chart dividesthe ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degreesof longitude perpendicularly through each of which districts aretwelve columns for the twelve months and horizontally through eachof which districts are three lines one to show the number of daysthat have been spent in each month in every district and the twoothers to show the number of days in which whales sperm or righthave been seenBesides when making a passage from one feedingground to anotherthe sperm whales guided by some infallible instinctsay rathersecret intelligence from the Deitymostly swim in VEINS as they arecalled continuing their way along a given oceanline with suchundeviating exactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by anychart with one tithe of such marvellous precision  Though in thesecases the direction taken by any one whale be straight as asurveyors parallel and though the line of advance be strictlyconfined to its own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitraryVEIN in which at these times he is said to swim generally embracessome few miles in width more or less as the vein is presumed toexpand or contract but never exceeds the visual sweep from thewhaleships mastheads when circumspectly gliding along this magiczone  The sum is that at particular seasons within that breadth andalong that path migrating whales may with great confidence be lookedforAnd hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separatefeedinggrounds could Ahab hope to encounter his prey but incrossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he couldby his art so place and time himself on his way as even then not tobe wholly without prospect of a meetingThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle hisdelirious but still methodical scheme  But not so in the realityperhaps  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regularseasons for particular grounds yet in general you cannot concludethat the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitudethis year say will turn out to be identically the same with thosethat were found there the preceding season though there are peculiarand unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has provedtrue  In general the same remark only within a less wide limitapplies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged spermwhales  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen forexample on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian oceanor Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast yet it did not follow thatwere the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequentcorresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there  Sotoo with some other feeding grounds where he had at times revealedhimself  But all these seemed only his casual stoppingplaces andoceaninns so to speak not his places of prolonged abode  Andwhere Ahabs chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto beenspoken of allusion has only been made to whatever waysideantecedent extra prospects were his ere a particular set time orplace were attained when all possibilities would becomeprobabilities and as Ahab fondly thought every possibility thenext thing to a certainty  That particular set time and place wereconjoined in the one technical phrasethe SeasonontheLine  Forthere and then for several consecutive years Moby Dick had beenperiodically descried lingering in those waters for awhile as thesun in its annual round loiters for a predicted interval in any onesign of the Zodiac  There it was too that most of the deadlyencounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves werestoried with his deeds there also was that tragic spot where themonomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance  Butin the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance withwhich Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt hewould not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowningfact above mentioned however flattering it might be to those hopesnor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize hisunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening questNow the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning ofthe SeasonontheLine  No possible endeavor then could enable hercommander to make the great passage southwards double Cape Horn andthen running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorialPacific in time to cruise there  Therefore he must wait for thenext ensuing season  Yet the premature hour of the Pequods sailinghad perhaps been correctly selected by Ahab with a view to thisvery complexion of things  Because an interval of three hundred andsixtyfive days and nights was before him an interval which insteadof impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneoushunt if by chance the White Whale spending his vacation in seas farremote from his periodical feedinggrounds should turn up hiswrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf or in the Bengal Bay or ChinaSeas or in any other waters haunted by his race  So that MonsoonsPampas NorWesters Harmattans Trades any wind but the Levanterand Simoon might blow Moby Dick into the devious zigzagworldcircle of the Pequods circumnavigating wakeBut granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems itnot but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean onesolitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable ofindividual recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded Muftiin the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople  Yes  For thepeculiar snowwhite brow of Moby Dick and his snowwhite hump couldnot but be unmistakable  And have I not tallied the whale Ahabwould mutter to himself as after poring over his charts till longafter midnight he would throw himself back in reveriestallied himand shall he escape  His broad fins are bored and scalloped outlike a lost sheeps ear  And here his mad mind would run on in abreathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering cameover him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recoverhis strength  Ah God what trances of torments does that man endurewho is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire  He sleepswith clenched hands and wakes with his own bloody nails in hispalmsOften when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerablyvivid dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughtsthrough the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies andwhirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain tillthe very throbbing of his lifespot became insufferable anguish andwhen as was sometimes the case these spiritual throes in him heavedhis being up from its base and a chasm seemed opening in him fromwhich forked flames and lightnings shot up and accursed fiendsbeckoned him to leap down among them when this hell in himselfyawned beneath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship andwith glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room as thoughescaping from a bed that was on fire  Yet these perhaps instead ofbeing the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or frightat his own resolve were but the plainest tokens of its intensityFor at such times crazy Ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfasthunter of the white whale this Ahab that had gone to his hammockwas not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horroragain  The latter was the eternal living principle or soul in himand in sleep being for the time dissociated from the characterizingmind which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle oragent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguityof the frantic thing of which for the time it was no longer anintegral  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with thesoul therefore it must have been that in Ahabs case yielding upall his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose thatpurpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself againstgods and devils into a kind of selfassumed independent being of itsown  Nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality towhich it was conjoined fled horrorstricken from the unbidden andunfathered birth  Therefore the tormented spirit that glared out ofbodily eyes when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room was for thetime but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray ofliving light to be sure but without an object to colour andtherefore a blankness in itself  God help thee old man thythoughts have created a creature in thee and he whose intensethinking thus makes him a Prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heartfor ever that vulture the very creature he createsCHAPTER 45The AffidavitSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeedas indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curiousparticulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter inits earlier part is as important a one as will be found in thisvolume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further andmore familiarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understoodand moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignoranceof the entire subject may induce in some minds as to the naturalverity of the main points of this affairI care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall becontent to produce the desired impression by separate citations ofitems practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and fromthese citations I take itthe conclusion aimed at will naturallyfollow of itselfFirst I have personally known three instances where a whale afterreceiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after aninterval in one instance of three years has been again struck bythe same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the sameprivate cypher have been taken from the body  In the instance wherethree years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons andI think it may have been something more than that the man who dartedthem happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyageto Africa went ashore there joined a discovery party andpenetrated far into the interior where he travelled for a period ofnearly two years often endangered by serpents savages tigerspoisonous miasmas with all the other common perils incident towandering in the heart of unknown regions  Meanwhile the whale hehad struck must also have been on its travels no doubt it had thricecircumnavigated the globe brushing with its flanks all the coasts ofAfrica but to no purpose  This man and this whale again cametogether and the one vanquished the other  I say I myself haveknown three instances similar to this that is in two of them I sawthe whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two ironswith the respective marks cut in them afterwards taken from the deadfish  In the threeyear instance it so fell out that I was in theboat both times first and last and the last time distinctlyrecognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whales eye whichI had observed there three years previous  I say three years but Iam pretty sure it was more than that  Here are three instancesthen which I personally know the truth of but I have heard of manyother instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is nogood ground to impeachSecondly It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery howeverignorant the world ashore may be of it that there have been severalmemorable historical instances where a particular whale in the oceanhas been at distant times and places popularly cognisable  Why sucha whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing tohis bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales forhowever peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soonput an end to his peculiarities by killing him and boiling him downinto a peculiarly valuable oil  No the reason was this that fromthe fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestigeof perilousness about such a whale as there did about RinaldoRinaldini insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise himby merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discoveredlounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a moreintimate acquaintance  Like some poor devils ashore that happen toknow an irascible great man they make distant unobtrusivesalutations to him in the street lest if they pursued theacquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for theirpresumptionBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individualcelebrityNay you may call

here are fourwhales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius orSylla to the classic scholarBut this is not all  New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel after atvarious times creating great havoc among the boats of differentvessels were finally gone in quest of systematically hunted outchased and killed by valiant whaling captains who heaved up theiranchors with that express object as much in view as in setting outthrough the Narragansett Woods Captain Butler of old had it in hismind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon the headmostwarrior of the Indian King PhilipI do not know where I can find a better place than just here to makemention of one or two other things which to me seem important as inprinted form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of thewhole story of the White Whale more especially the catastrophe  Forthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth requiresfull as much bolstering as error  So ignorant are most landsmen ofsome of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world thatwithout some hints touching the plain facts historical andotherwise of the fishery they might scout at Moby Dick as amonstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous andintolerable allegoryFirst Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the generalperils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixedvivid conception of those perils and the frequency with which theyrecur  One reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actualdisasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds apublic record at home however transient and immediately forgottenthat record  Do you suppose that that poor fellow there who thismoment perhaps caught by the whaleline off the coast of New Guineais being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the soundingleviathando you suppose that that poor fellows name will appear inthe newspaper obituary you will read tomorrow at your breakfastNo because the mails are very irregular between here and New GuineaIn fact did you ever hear what might be called regular news director indirect from New Guinea  Yet I tell you that upon one particularvoyage which I made to the Pacific among many others we spoke thirtydifferent ships every one of which had had a death by a whale someof them more than one and three that had each lost a boats crewFor Gods sake be economical with your lamps and candles not agallon you burn but at least one drop of mans blood was spilled foritSecondly People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whaleis an enormous creature of enormous power but I have ever found thatwhen narrating to them some specific example of this twofoldenormousness they have significantly complimented me upon myfacetiousness when I declare upon my soul I had no more idea ofbeing facetious than Moses when he wrote the history of the plaguesof EgyptBut fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upontestimony entirely independent of my own  That point is this TheSperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing andjudiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave inutterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the SpermWhale HAS done itFirst In the year 1820 the ship Essex Captain Pollard ofNantucket was cruising in the Pacific Ocean  One day she sawspouts lowered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whalesEre long several of the whales were wounded when suddenly a verylarge whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and boredirectly down upon the ship  Dashing his forehead against her hullhe so stove her in that in less than ten minutes she settled downand fell over  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen sinceAfter the severest exposure part of the crew reached the land intheir boats  Being returned home at last Captain Pollard once moresailed for the Pacific in command of another ship but the godsshipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers for the secondtime his ship was utterly lost and forthwith forswearing the sea hehas never tempted it since  At this day Captain Pollard is aresident of Nantucket  I have seen Owen Chace who was chief mate ofthe Essex at the time of the tragedy I have read his plain andfaithful narrative I have conversed with his son and all thiswithin a few miles of the scene of the catastropheThe following are extracts from Chaces narrative Every factseemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chancewhich directed his operations he made two several attacks upon theship at a short interval between them both of which according totheir direction were calculated to do us the most injury by beingmade ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects forthe shock to effect which the exact manoeuvres which he made werenecessary  His aspect was most horrible and such as indicatedresentment and fury  He came directly from the shoal which we hadjust before entered and in which we had struck three of hiscompanions as if fired with revenge for their sufferings  AgainAt all events the whole circumstances taken together all happeningbefore my own eyes and producing at the time impressions in mymind of decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale manyof which impressions I cannot now recall induce me to be satisfiedthat I am correct in my opinionHere are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during ablack night an open boat when almost despairing of reaching anyhospitable shore  The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothingthe fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashedupon hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearfulcontemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moments thought thedismal looking wreck and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALEwholly engrossed my reflections until day again made itsappearanceIn another placep 45he speaks of THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTALATTACK OF THE ANIMALSecondly The ship Union also of Nantucket was in the year 1807totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset but the authenticparticulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounterthough from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casualallusions to itThirdly Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J thencommanding an American sloopofwar of the first class happened tobe dining with a party of whaling captains on board a Nantucket shipin the harbor of Oahu Sandwich Islands  Conversation turning uponwhales the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching theamazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemenpresent  He peremptorily denied for example that any whale could sosmite his stout sloopofwar as to cause her to leak so much as athimbleful  Very good but there is more coming  Some weeks afterthe Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso  Buthe was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a fewmoments confidential business with him  That business consisted infetching the Commodores craft such a thwack that with all his pumpsgoing he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repairI am not superstitious but I consider the Commodores interviewwith that whale as providential  Was not Saul of Tarsus convertedfrom unbelief by a similar fright  I tell you the sperm whale willstand no nonsenseI will now refer you to Langsdorffs Voyages for a littlecircumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereofLangsdorff you must know by the way was attached to the RussianAdmiral Krusensterns famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning ofthe present century  Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenthchapterBy the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail and the nextday we were out in the open sea on our way to Ochotsh  The weatherwas very clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obligedto keep on our fur clothing  For some days we had very little windit was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwestsprang up  An uncommon large whale the body of which was largerthan the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but wasnot perceived by any one on board till the moment when the shipwhich was in full sail was almost upon him so that it wasimpossible to prevent its striking against him  We were thus placedin the most imminent danger as this gigantic creature setting upits back raised the ship three feet at least out of the water  Themasts reeled and the sails fell altogether while we who were belowall sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struckupon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off withthe utmost gravity and solemnity  Captain DWolf applied immediatelyto the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received anydamage from the shock but we found that very happily it had escapedentirely uninjuredNow the Captain DWolf here alluded to as commanding the ship inquestion is a New Englander who after a long life of unusualadventures as a seacaptain this day resides in the village ofDorchester near Boston  I have the honour of being a nephew of hisI have particularly questioned him concerning this passage inLangsdorff  He substantiates every word  The ship however was byno means a large one a Russian craft built on the Siberian coastand purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which hesailed from homeIn that up and down manly book of oldfashioned adventure so fulltoo of honest wondersthe voyage of Lionel Wafer one of ancientDampiers old chumsI found a little matter set down so like thatjust quoted from Langsdorff that I cannot forbear inserting it herefor a corroborative example if such be neededLionel it seems was on his way to John Ferdinando as he callsthe modern Juan Fernandes  In our way thither he says aboutfour oclock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fiftyleagues from the Main of America our ship felt a terrible shockwhich put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tellwhere they were or what to think but every one began to prepare fordeath  And indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that wetook it for granted the ship had struck against a rock but when theamazement was a little over we cast the lead and sounded but foundno ground    The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap intheir carriages and several of the men were shaken out of theirhammocks  Captain Davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrownout of his cabin  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to anearthquake and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating thata great earthquake somewhere about that time did actually do greatmischief along the Spanish land  But I should not much wonder if inthe darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was afterall caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull frombeneathI might proceed with several more examples one way or another knownto me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale  Inmore than one instance he has been known not only to chase theassailing boats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itselfand long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks  TheEnglish ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head and as forhis strength let me say that there have been examples where thelines attached to a running sperm whale have in a calm beentransferred to the ship and secured there the whale towing hergreat hull through the water as a horse walks off with a cartAgain it is very often observed that if the sperm whale oncestruck is allowed time to rally he then acts not so often withblind rage as with wilful deliberate designs of destruction to hispursuers nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of hischaracter that upon being attacked he will frequently open hismouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutiveminutes  But I must be content with only one more and a concludingillustration a remarkable and most significant one by which youwill not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event inthis book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but thatthese marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages sothat for the millionth time we say amen with SolomonVerily there isnothing new under the sunIn the sixth Christian century lived Procopius a Christianmagistrate of Constantinople in the days when Justinian was Emperorand Belisarius general  As many know he wrote the history of hisown times a work every way of uncommon value  By the bestauthorities he has always been considered a most trustworthy andunexaggerating historian except in some one or two particulars notat all affecting the matter presently to be mentionedNow in this history of his Procopius mentions that during the termof his prefecture at Constantinople a great seamonster was capturedin the neighboring Propontis or Sea of Marmora after havingdestroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of morethan fifty years  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannoteasily be gainsaid  Nor is there any reason it should be  Of whatprecise species this seamonster was is not mentioned  But as hedestroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been awhale and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale  And I willtell you why  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale hadbeen always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep watersconnecting with it  Even now I am certain that those seas are notand perhaps never can be in the present constitution of things aplace for his habitual gregarious resort  But further investigationshave recently proved to me that in modern times there have beenisolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in theMediterranean  I am told on good authority that on the Barbarycoast a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of asperm whale  Now as a vessel of war readily passes through theDardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass outof the Mediterranean into the PropontisIn the Propontis as far as I can learn none of that peculiarsubstance called BRIT is to be found the aliment of the right whaleBut I have every reason to believe that the food of the spermwhalesquid or cuttlefishlurks at the bottom of that sea becauselarge creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have beenfound at its surface  If then you properly put these statementstogether and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive thataccording to all human reasoning Procopiuss seamonster that forhalf a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor must in allprobability have been a sperm whaleCHAPTER 46SurmisesThough consumed with the hot fire of his purpose Ahab in all histhoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of MobyDick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests tothat one passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by natureand long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whalemans waysaltogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage  Orat least if this were otherwise there were not wanting other motivesmuch more influential with him  It would be refining too muchperhaps even considering his monomania to hint that hisvindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extendeditself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monstershe slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that eachsubsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one hehunted  But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable therewere still additional considerations which though not so strictlyaccording with the wildness of his ruling passion yet were by nomeans incapable of swaying himTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools and of all tools usedin the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order  Heknew for example that however magnetic his ascendency in somerespects was over Starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover thecomplete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiorityinvolves intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual theintellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation  Starbucksbody and Starbucks coerced will were Ahabs so long as Ahab kepthis magnet at Starbucks brain still he knew that for all this thechief mate in his soul abhorred his captains quest and could hewould joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate itIt might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale wasseen  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fallinto open relapses of rebellion against his captains leadershipunless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influences werebrought to bear upon him  Not only that but the subtle insanity ofAhab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifestedthan in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that forthe present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strangeimaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that the fullterror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscurebackground for few mens courage is proof against protractedmeditation unrelieved by action that when they stood their longnight watches his officers and men must have some nearer things tothink of than Moby Dick  For however eagerly and impetuously thesavage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailorsof all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliablethey live inthe varying outer weather and they inhale its ficklenessand whenretained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit howeverpromissory of life and passion in the end it is above all thingsrequisite that temporary interests and employments should interveneand hold them healthily suspended for the final dashNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing  In times of strong emotionmankind disdain all base considerations but such times areevanescent  The permanent constitutional condition of themanufactured man thought Ahab is sordidness  Granting that theWhite Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew andplaying round their savageness even breeds a certain generousknighterrantism in them still while for the love of it they givechase to Moby Dick they must also have food for their more commondaily appetites  For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders ofold times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land tofight for their holy sepulchre without committing burglariespicking pockets and gaining other pious perquisites by the way  Hadthey been strictly held to their one final and romantic objectthatfinal and romantic object too many would have turned from indisgust  I will not strip these men thought Ahab of all hopes ofcashaye cash  They may scorn cash now but let some months go byand no perspective promise of it to them and then this samequiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash wouldsoon cashier AhabNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more relatedto Ahab personally  Having impulsively it is probable and perhapssomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of thePequods voyage Ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doinghe had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge ofusurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crewif so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all furtherobedience to him and even violently wrest from him the commandFrom even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and thepossible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining groundAhab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself  Thatprotection could only consist in his own predominating brain andheart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attention toevery minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crewto be subjected toFor all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to beverbally developed here Ahab plainly saw that he must still in agood degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of thePequods voyage observe all customary usages and not only that butforce himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in thegeneral pursuit of his professionBe all this as it may his voice was now often heard hailing thethree mastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright lookout andnot omit reporting even a porpoise  This vigilance was not longwithout rewardCHAPTER 47The MatMakerIt was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily loungingabout the decks or vacantly gazing over into the leadcolouredwaters  Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called aswordmat for an additional lashing to our boat  So still andsubdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene and such anincantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailorseemed resolved into his own invisible selfI was the attendant or page of Queequeg while busy at the mat  As Ikept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between thelong yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and asQueequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken swordbetween the threads and idly looking off upon the water carelesslyand unthinkingly drove home every yarn I say so strange adreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over thesea only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword that itseemed as if this were the Loom of Time and I myself were a shuttlemechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates  There lay thefixed threads of the warp subject to but one single ever returningunchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to admit ofthe crosswise interblending of other threads with its own  This warpseemed necessity and here thought I with my own hand I ply my ownshuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threadsMeantime Queequegs impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hittingthe woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly as thecase might be and by this difference in the concluding blowproducing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of thecompleted fabric this savages sword thought I which thus finallyshapes and fashions both warp and woof this easy indifferent swordmust be chanceaye chance free will and necessitynowiseincompatibleall interweavingly working together  The straight warpof necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate courseits everyalternating vibration indeed only tending to that free will stillfree to ply her shuttle between given threads and chance thoughrestrained in its play within the right lines of necessity andsideways in its motions directed by free will though thus prescribedto by both chance by turns rules either and has the last featuringblow at eventsThus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound sostrange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ballof free will dropped from my hand and I stood gazing up at theclouds whence that voice dropped like a wing  High aloft in thecrosstrees was that mad GayHeader Tashtego  His body was reachingeagerly forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at briefsudden intervals he continued his cries  To be sure the same soundwas that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas fromhundreds of whalemens lookouts perched as high in the air but fromfew of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such amarvellous cadence as from Tashtego the IndiansAs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly andeagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him someprophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate and by those wildcries announcing their comingThere she blows there there there she blows she blowsWhereawayOn the leebeam about two miles off a school of themInstantly all was commotionThe Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks with the same undeviating andreliable uniformity  And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish fromother tribes of his genusThere go flukes was now the cry from Tashtego and the whalesdisappearedQuick steward cried Ahab  Time timeDoughBoy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exactminute to AhabThe ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gently rollingbefore it  Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down headingto leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly inadvance of our bows  For that singular craft at times evinced by theSperm Whale when sounding with his head in one direction henevertheless while concealed beneath the surface mills round andswiftly swims off in the opposite quarterthis deceitfulness of hiscould not now be in action for there was no reason to suppose thatthe fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knewat all of our vicinity  One of the men selected forshipkeepersthat is those not appointed to the boats by this timerelieved the Indian at the mainmast head  The sailors at the foreand mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed in their placesthe cranes were thrust out the mainyard was backed and the threeboats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over highcliffs  Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one handclung to the rail while one foot was expectantly poised on thegunwale  So look the long line of manofwars men about to throwthemselves on board an enemys shipBut at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that tookevery eye from the whale  With a start all glared at dark Ahab whowas surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out ofairCHAPTER 48The First LoweringThe phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the otherside of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loosethe tackles and bands of the boat which swung there  This boat hadalways been deemed one of the spare boats though technically calledthe captains on account of its hanging from the starboard quarterThe figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with onewhite tooth evilly protruding from its steellike lips  A rumpledChinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wideblack trowsers of the same dark stuff  But strangely crowning thisebonness was a glistening white plaited turban the living hairbraided and coiled round and round upon his head  Less swart inaspect the companions of this figure were of that vividtigeryellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives ofthe Manillasa race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtiltyand by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies andsecret confidential agents on the water of the devil their lordwhose countingroom they suppose to be elsewhereWhile yet the wondering ships company were gazing upon thesestrangers Ahab cried out to the whiteturbaned old man at theirhead All ready there FedallahReady was the halfhissed replyLower away then dye hear shouting across the deck  Lower awaythere I saySuch was the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement themen sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blockswith a wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with adexterous offhanded daring unknown in any other vocation thesailors goatlike leaped down the rolling ships side into thetossed boats belowHardly had they pulled out from under the ships lee when a fourthkeel coming from the windward side pulled round under the sternand showed the five strangers rowing Ahab who standing erect in thestern loudly hailed Starbuck Stubb and Flask to spread themselveswidely so as to cover a large expanse of water  But with all theireyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew the inmatesof the other boats obeyed not the commandCaptain Ahab said StarbuckSpread yourselves cried Ahab give way all four boats  ThouFlask pull out more to leewardAye aye sir cheerily cried little KingPost sweeping round hisgreat steering

Stubb to his crew some ofwhom still showed signs of uneasiness  Why dont you break yourbackbones my boys  What is it you stare at  Those chaps in yonderboat  Tut  They are only five more hands come to

Start her marlingspikesStubbs exordium to his crew is given here at large because he hadrather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especiallyin inculcating the religion of rowing  But you must not suppose fromthis specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downrightpassions with his congregation  Not at all and therein consistedhis chief peculiarity  He would say the most terrific things to hiscrew in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the furyseemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsmancould hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life andyet pulling for the mere joke of the thing  Besides he all the timelooked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed hissteeringoar and so broadly gapedopenmouthed at timesthat themere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrastacted like a charm upon the crew  Then again Stubb was one of thoseodd sort of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiouslyambiguous as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter ofobeying themIn obedience to a sign from Ahab Starbuck was now pulling obliquelyacross Stubbs bow and when for a minute or so the two boats werepretty near to each other Stubb hailed the mateMr Starbuck larboard boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if yepleaseHalloa returned Starbuck turning round not a single inch as hespoke

Whales atthe bottom of it  Well well so be it  Cant be helped  Allright  Give way men  It aint the White Whale today  Give wayNow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a criticalinstant as the lowering of the boats from the deck this had notunreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some ofthe ships company but Archys fancied discovery having some timeprevious got abroad among them though indeed not credited then thishad in some small measure prepared them for the event  It took offthe extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this andStubbs confident way of accounting for their appearance they werefor the time freed from superstitious surmisings though the affairstill left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as todark Ahabs precise agency in the matter from the beginning  For meI silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping onboard the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn as well as theenigmatical hintings of the unaccountable ElijahMeantime Ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided thefurthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats acircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him  Thosetiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone likefive triphammers they rose and fell with regular strokes ofstrength which periodically started the boat along the water like ahorizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer  As forFedallah who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrownaside his black jacket and displayed his naked chest with the wholepart of his body above the gunwale clearly cut against thealternating depressions of the watery horizon while at the other endof the boat Ahab with one arm like a fencers thrown half backwardinto the air as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip Ahab wasseen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boatlowerings ere the White Whale had torn him  All at once theoutstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixedwhile the boats five oars were seen simultaneously peaked  Boat andcrew sat motionless on the sea  Instantly the three spread boats inthe rear paused on their way  The whales had irregularly settledbodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible tokenof the movement though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observeditEvery man look out along his oars cried Starbuck  ThouQueequeg stand upNimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow thesavage stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed offtowards the spot where the chase had last been descried  Likewiseupon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularlyplatformed level with the gunwale Starbuck himself was seen coollyand adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip ofa craft and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the seaNot very far distant Flasks boat was also lying breathlessly stillits commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead astout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet abovethe level of the stern platform  It is used for catching turns withthe whale line  Its top is not more spacious than the palm of amans hand and standing upon such a base as that Flask seemedperched at the masthead of some ship which had sunk to all but hertrucks  But little KingPost was small and short and at the sametime little KingPost was full of a large and tall ambition so thatthis loggerhead standpoint of his did by no means satisfy KingPostI cant see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on tothatUpon this Daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady hisway swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered hislofty shoulders for a pedestalGood a masthead as any sir  Will you mountThat I will and thank ye very much my fine fellow only I wish youfifty feet tallerWhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of theboat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palmto Flasks foot and then putting Flasks hand on his hearseplumedhead and bidding him spring as he himself should toss with onedexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shouldersAnd here was Flask now standing Daggoo with one lifted armfurnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himselfbyAt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with whatwondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain anerect posture in his boat even when pitched about by the mostriotously perverse and crossrunning seas  Still more strange to seehim giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under suchcircumstances  But the sight of little Flask mounted upon giganticDaggoo was yet more curious for sustaining himself with a coolindifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro toevery roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form  On hisbroad back flaxenhaired Flask seemed a snowflake  The bearerlooked nobler than the rider  Though truly vivacious tumultuousostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatiencebut not one added heave did he thereby give to the negros lordlychest  So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the livingmagnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and herseasons for thatMeanwhile Stubb the third mate betrayed no such fargazingsolicitudes  The whales might have made one of their regularsoundings not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that werethe case Stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved tosolace the languishing interval with his pipe  He withdrew it fromhis hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather  Heloaded it and rammed home the loading with his thumbend but hardlyhad he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his handwhen Tashtego his harpooneer whose eyes had been setting towindward like two fixed stars suddenly dropped like light from hiserect attitude to his seat crying out in a quick phrensy of hurryDown down all and give waythere they areTo a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have beenvisible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish whitewater and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it andsuffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from whiterolling billows  The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as itwere like the air over intensely heated plates of iron  Beneaththis atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thinlayer of water also the whales were swimming  Seen in advance ofall the other indications the puffs of vapour they spouted seemedtheir forerunning couriers and detached flying outridersAll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubledwater and air  But it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and onas a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from thehillsPull pull my good boys said Starbuck in the lowest possible butintensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixedglance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemedas two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses  He didnot say much to his crew though nor did his crew say anything tohim  Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlinglypierced by one of his peculiar whispers now harsh with command nowsoft with entreatyHow different the loud little KingPost  Sing out and saysomething my hearties  Roar and pull my thunderbolts  Beach mebeach me on their black backs boys only do that for me and Illsign over to you my Marthas Vineyard plantation boys includingwife and children boys  Lay me onlay me on  O Lord Lord but Ishall go stark staring mad  See see that white water  And soshouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down onit then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea and finallyfell to rearing and plunging in the boats stern like a crazed coltfrom the prairieLook at that chap now philosophically drawled Stubb who with hisunlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at ashort distance followed afterHes got fits that Flask hasFits yes give him fitsthats the very wordpitch fits into emMerrily merrily heartsalive  Pudding for supper youknowmerrys the word  Pull babespull sucklingspull allBut what the devil are you hurrying about  Softly softly andsteadily my men  Only pull and keep pulling nothing more  Crackall your backbones and bite your knives in twothats all  Take iteasywhy dont ye take it easy I say and burst all your livers andlungsBut what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tigeryellow crewof histhese were words best omitted here for you live under theblessed light of the evangelical land  Only the infidel sharks inthe audacious seas may give ear to such words when with tornadobrow and eyes of red murder and foamglued lips Ahab leaped afterhis preyMeanwhile all the boats tore on  The repeated specific allusions ofFlask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which hedeclared to be incessantly tantalizing his boats bow with itstailthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelikethat they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearfullook over the shoulder  But this was against all rule for theoarsmen must put out their eyes and ram a skewer through theirnecks usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears andno limbs but arms in these critical momentsIt was a sight full of quick wonder and awe  The vast swells of theomnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made as they rolledalong the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in a boundlessbowlinggreen the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tipfor an instant on the knifelike edge of the sharper waves thatalmost seemed threatening to cut it in two the sudden profound dipinto the watery glens and hollows the keen spurrings and goadings togain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sledlike slide downits other sideall these with the cries of the headsmen andharpooneers and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen with thewondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats withoutstretched sails like a wild hen after her screaming broodallthis was thrillingNot the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into thefever heat of his first battle not the dead mans ghost encounteringthe first unknown phantom in the other worldneither of these canfeel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does who for thefirst time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle ofthe hunted sperm whaleThe dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more andmore visible owing to the increasing darkness of the duncloudshadows flung upon the sea  The jets of vapour no longerblended but tilted everywhere to right and left the whales seemedseparating their wakes  The boats were pulled more apart Starbuckgiving chase to three whales running dead to leeward  Our sail wasnow set and with the still rising wind we rushed along the boatgoing with such madness through the water that the lee oars couldscarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from therowlocksSoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist neithership nor boat to be seenGive way men whispered Starbuck drawing still further aft thesheet of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before thesquall comes  Theres white water againclose to  SpringSoon after two cries in quick succession on each side of us denotedthat the other boats had got fast but hardly were they overheardwhen with a lightninglike hurtling whisper Starbuck said Standup and Queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his feetThough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and deathperil so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intensecountenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that theimminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowingsound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter  Meanwhile theboat was still booming through the mist the waves curling andhissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpentsThats his hump  THERE THERE give it to him whispered StarbuckA short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted ironof Queequeg  Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible pushfrom astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge thesail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapour shot up nearby something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us  Thewhole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helterskelterinto the white curdling cream of the squall  Squall whale andharpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by theiron escapedThough completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed  Swimminground it we picked up the floating oars and lashing them across thegunwale tumbled back to our places  There we sat up to our knees inthe sea the water covering every rib and plank so that to ourdownward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown upto us from the bottom of the oceanThe wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklerstogether the whole squall roared forked and crackled around uslike a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we wereburning immortal in these jaws of death  In vain we hailed theother boats as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of aflaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm  Meanwhile thedriving scud rack and mist grew darker with the shadows of nightno sign of the ship could be seen  The rising sea forbade allattempts to bale out the boat  The oars were useless as propellersperforming now the office of lifepreservers  So cutting thelashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures Starbuckcontrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on awaif pole handed it to Queequeg as the standardbearer of thisforlorn hope  There then he sat holding up that imbecile candlein the heart of that almighty forlornness  There then he sat thesign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hope inthe midst of despairWet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship orboat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on  The mist stillspread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom ofthe boat  Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet hollowing his handto his ear  We all heard a faint creaking as of ropes and yardshitherto muffled by the storm  The sound came nearer and nearer thethick mists were dimly parted by a huge vague form  Affrighted weall sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view bearingright down upon us within a distance of not much more than itslengthFloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instantit tossed and gaped beneath the ships bows like a chip at the baseof a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seenno more till it came up weltering astern  Again we swam for it weredashed against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safelylanded on board  Ere the squall came close to the other boats hadcut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time  Theship had given us up but was still cruising if haply it might lightupon some token of our perishingan oar or a lance poleCHAPTER 49The HyenaThere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixedaffair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vastpractical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns andmore than suspects that the joke is at nobodys expense but his ownHowever nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputingHe bolts down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasionsall hard things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as anostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints  Andas for small difficulties and worryings prospects of suddendisaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seemto him only sly goodnatured hits and jolly punches in the sidebestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker  That odd sort ofwayward mood I am speaking of comes over a man only in some time ofextreme tribulation it comes in the very midst of his earnestnessso that what just before might have seemed to him a thing mostmomentous now seems but a part of the general joke  There isnothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sortof genial desperado philosophy and with it I now regarded thiswhole voyage of the Pequod and the great White Whale its objectQueequeg said I when they had dragged me the last man to thedeck and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off thewater Queequeg my fine friend does this sort of thing oftenhappen  Without much emotion though soaked through just like mehe gave me to understand that such things did often happenMr Stubb said I turning to that worthy who buttoned up in hisoiljacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain Mr StubbI think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met ourchief mate Mr Starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent  Isuppose then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail setin a foggy squall is the height of a whalemans discretionCertain  Ive lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale offCape HornMr Flask said I turning to little KingPost who was standingclose by you are experienced in these things and I am not  Willyou tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery MrFlask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himselfbackforemost into deaths jawsCant you twist that smaller said Flask  Yes thats the law  Ishould like to see a boats crew backing water up to a whale faceforemost  Ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mindthatHere then from three impartial witnesses I had a deliberatestatement of the entire case  Considering therefore that squallsand capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deepwere matters of common occurrence in this kind of life consideringthat at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale Imust resign my life into the hands of him who steered theboatoftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in hisimpetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his ownfrantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to ourown particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbucks drivingon to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall and considering thatStarbuck notwithstanding was famous for his great heedfulness inthe fishery considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudentStarbucks boat and finally considering in what a devils chase Iwas implicated touching the White Whale taking all things togetherI say I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft ofmy will  Queequeg said I come along you shall be my lawyerexecutor and legateeIt may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering attheir last wills and testaments but there are no people in the worldmore fond of that diversion  This was the fourth time in my nauticallife that I had done the same thing  After the ceremony wasconcluded upon the present occasion I felt all the easier a stonewas rolled away from my heart  Besides all the days I should nowlive would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after hisresurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeksas the case might be  I survived myself my death and burial werelocked up in my chest  I looked round me tranquilly and contentedlylike a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars ofa snug family vaultNow then thought I unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of myfrock here goes for a cool collected dive at death and destructionand the devil fetch the hindmostCHAPTER 50Ahabs Boat and Crew  FedallahWho would have thought it Flask cried Stubb if I had but oneleg you would not catch me in a boat unless maybe to stop theplughole with my timber toe  Oh hes a wonderful old manI dont think it so strange after all on that account saidFlask  If his leg were off at the hip now it would be a differentthing  That would disable him but he has one knee and good part ofthe other left you knowI dont know that my little man I never yet saw him kneelAmong whalewise people it has often been argued whether consideringthe paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage itis right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the activeperils of the chase  So Tamerlanes soldiers often argued with tearsin their eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to becarried into the thickest of the fightBut with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect  Consideringthat with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times ofdanger considering that the pursuit of whales is always under greatand extraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeedthen comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for anymaimed man to enter a whaleboat in the hunt  As a general thingthe jointowners of the Pequod must have plainly thought notAhab well knew that although his friends at home would think littleof his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudesof the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action andgiving his orders in person yet for Captain Ahab to have a boatactually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the huntaboveall for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men as that sameboats crew he well knew that such generous conceits never entered theheads of the owners of the Pequod  Therefore he had not solicited aboats crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires onthat head  Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his owntouching all that matter  Until Cabacos published discovery thesailors had little foreseen it though to be sure when after being alittle while out of port all hands had concluded the customarybusiness of fitting the whaleboats for service when some time afterthis Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter ofmaking tholepins with his own hands for what was thought to be oneof the spare boats and even solicitously cutting the small woodenskewers which when the line is running out are pinned over thegroove in the bow when all this was observed in him andparticularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing inthe bottom of the boat as if to make it better withstand the pointedpressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety he evinced inexactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is sometimescalled the horizontal piece in the boats bow for bracing the kneeagainst in darting or stabbing at the whale when it was observed howoften he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in thesemicircular depression in the cleat and with the carpenterschisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little thereall these things I say had awakened much interest and curiosity atthe time  But almost everybody supposed that this particularpreparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to theultimate chase of Moby Dick for he had already revealed hisintention to hunt that mortal monster in person  But such asupposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to anyboats crew being assigned to that boatNow with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon wanedaway for in a whaler wonders soon wane  Besides now and then suchunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from theunknown nooks and ashholes of the earth to man these floatingoutlaws of whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queercastaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bitsof wreck oars whaleboats canoes blownoff Japanese junks andwhat not that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and stepdown into the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not createany unsubduable excitement in the forecastleBut be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinatephantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as itwere somehow distinct from them yet that hairturbaned Fedallahremained a muffled mystery to the last  Whence he came in a mannerlyworld like this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evincedhimself to be linked with Ahabs peculiar fortunes nay so far as tohave some sort of a halfhinted influence Heaven knows but it mighthave been even authority over him all this none knew  But onecannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah  He was such acreature as civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only seein their dreams and that but dimly but the like of whom now andthen glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities especially theOriental isles to the east of the continentthose insulatedimmemorial unalterable countries which even in these modern daysstill preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earths primalgenerations when the memory of the first man was a distinctrecollection and all men his descendants unknowing whence he cameeyed each other as real phantoms and asked of the sun and the moonwhy they were created and to what end when though according toGenesis the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men thedevils also add the uncanonical Rabbins indulged in mundane amoursCHAPTER 51The SpiritSpoutDays weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory Pequod had slowlyswept across four several cruisinggrounds that off the Azores offthe Cape de Verdes on the Plate so called being off the mouth ofthe Rio de la Plata and the Carrol Ground an unstaked waterylocality southerly from St HelenaIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene andmoonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silverand by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silverysilence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet wasseen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow  Lit up by themoon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering goduprising from the sea  Fedallah first descried this jet  For ofthese moonlight nights it was his wont to mount to the mainmasthead and stand a lookout there with the same precision as if ithad been day  And yet though herds of whales were seen by nightnot one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them  Youmay think with what emotions then the seamen beheld this oldOriental perched aloft at such unusual hours his turban and themoon companions in one sky  But when after spending his uniforminterval there for several successive nights without uttering asingle sound when after all this silence his unearthly voice washeard announcing that silvery moonlit jet every reclining marinerstarted to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in therigging and hailed the mortal crew  There she blows  Had thetrump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet stillthey felt no terror rather pleasure  For though it was a mostunwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriouslyexciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired aloweringWalking the deck with quick sidelunging strides Ahab commanded thetgallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread  Thebest man in the ship must take the helm  Then with every mastheadmanned the piledup craft rolled down before the wind  The strangeupheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling thehollows of so many sails made the buoyant hovering deck to feellike air beneath the feet while still she rushed along as if twoantagonistic influences were struggling in herone to mount directto heaven the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal  Andhad you watched Ahabs face that night you would have thought thatin him also two different things were warring  While his one liveleg made lively echoes along the deck every stroke of his dead limbsounded like a coffintap  On life and death this old man walkedBut though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye likearrows the eager glances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seenthat night  Every sailor swore he saw it once but not a secondtimeThis midnightspout had almost grown a forgotten thing when somedays after lo at the same silent hour it was again announcedagain it was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake itonce more it disappeared as if it had never been  And so it servedus night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at itMysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as thecase might be disappearing again for one whole day or two days orthree and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to beadvancing still further and further in our van this solitary jetseemed for ever alluring us onNor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordancewith the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many thingsinvested the Pequod were there wanting some of the seamen who sworethat whenever and wherever descried at however remote times or inhowever far apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout wascast by one selfsame whale and that whale Moby Dick  For a timethere reigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flittingapparition as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on inorder that the monster might turn round upon us and rend us at lastin the remotest and most savage seasThese temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived awondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather inwhich beneath all its blue blandness some thought there lurked adevilish charm as for days and days we voyaged along through seasso wearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to ourvengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urnlikeprowBut at last when turning to the eastward the Cape winds beganhowling around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seasthat are there when the ivorytusked Pequod sharply bowed to theblast and gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers ofsilver chips the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks then all thisdesolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sights moredismal than beforeClose to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither andthither before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutablesearavens  And every morning perched on our stays rows of thesebirds were seen and spite of our hootings for a long timeobstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship somedrifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation andtherefore fit roostingplace for their homeless selves  And heavedand heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea as if its vasttides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguishand remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bredCape of Good Hope do they call ye  Rather Cape Tormentoto ascalled of yore for long allured by the perfidious silences thatbefore had attended us we found ourselves launched into thistormented sea where guilty beings transformed into those fowls andthese fish seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without anyhaven in store or beat that black air without any horizon  Butcalm snowwhite and unvarying still directing its fountain offeathers to the sky still beckoning us on from before the solitaryjet would at times be descriedDuring all this blackness of the elements Ahab though assuming forthe time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerousdeck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than everaddressed his mates  In tempestuous times like these aftereverything above and aloft has been secured nothing more can be donebut passively to await the issue of the gale  Then Captain and crewbecome practical fatalists  So with his ivory leg inserted into itsaccustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud Ahab forhours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while anoccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his veryeyelashes together  Meantime the crew driven from the forward partof the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bowsstood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better toguard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into asort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in aloosened belt  Few or no words were spoken and the silent ship asif manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore on throughall the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves  By nightthe same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the oceanprevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowlines stillwordless Ahab stood up to the blast  Even when wearied nature seemeddemanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammockNever could Starbuck forget the old mans aspect when one nightgoing down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw himwith closed eyes sitting straight in his floorscrewed chair therain and halfmelted sleet of the storm from which he had some timebefore emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat andcoat  On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts oftides and currents which have previously been spoken of  His lanternswung from his tightly clenched hand  Though the body was erect thehead was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards theneedle of the telltale that swung from a beam in the ceilingThe cabincompass is called the telltale because without going tothe compass at the helm the Captain while below can inform himselfof the course of the shipTerrible old man thought Starbuck with a shudder sleeping in thisgale still thou steadfastly eyest thy purposeCHAPTER 52The AlbatrossSoutheastward from the Cape off the distant Crozetts a goodcruising ground for Right Whalemen a sail loomed ahead the GoneyAlbatross by name  As she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch atthe foremasthead I had a good view of that sight so remarkable toa tyro in the far ocean fisheriesa whaler at sea and long absentfrom homeAs if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like theskeleton of a stranded walrus  All down her sides this spectralappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while allher spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of treesfurred over with hoarfrost  Only her lower sails were set  A wildsight it was to see her longbearded lookouts at those threemastheads  They seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn andbepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years ofcruising  Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they swayed andswung over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glidedclose under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to eachother that we might almost have leaped from the mastheads of oneship to those of the other yet those forlornlooking fishermenmildly eyeing us as they passed said not one word to our ownlookouts while the quarterdeck hail was being heard from belowShip ahoy  Have ye seen the White WhaleBut as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was inthe act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from hishand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain stroveto make himself heard without it  Meantime his ship was stillincreasing the distance between  While in various silent waysthe seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of thisominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whales nameto another ship Ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as thoughhe would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not thethreatening wind forbade  But taking advantage of his windwardposition he again seized his trumpet and knowing by her aspect thatthe stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home heloudly hailedAhoy there  This is the Pequod bound round theworld  Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific oceanand this time three years if I am not at home tell them to addressthem toAt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantlythen in accordance with their singular ways shoals of smallharmless fish that for some days before had been placidly swimmingby our side darted away with what seemed shuddering fins and rangedthemselves fore and aft with the strangers flanks  Though in thecourse of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticeda similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest triflescapriciously carry meaningsSwim away from me do ye murmured Ahab gazing over into thewater  There seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyedmore of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever beforeevinced  But turning to the steersman who thus far had been holdingthe ship in the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his oldlion voiceUp helm  Keep her off round the worldRound the world  There is much in that sound to inspire proudfeelings but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct  Onlythrough numberless perils to the very point whence we started wherethose that we left behind secure were all the time before usWere this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we couldfor ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet andstrange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon then there werepromise in the voyage  But in pursuit of those far mysteries wedream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some timeor other swims before all human hearts while chasing such over thisround globe they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leaveus whelmedCHAPTER 53The GamThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler wehad spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms  But even hadthis not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boardedherjudging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasionsif so ithad been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negativeanswer to the question he put  For as it eventually turned out hecared not to consort even for five minutes with any strangercaptain except he could contribute some of that information he soabsorbingly sought  But all this might remain inadequatelyestimated were not something said here of the peculiar usages ofwhalingvessels when meeting each other in foreign seas andespecially on a common cruisinggroundIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State or theequally desolate Salisbury Plain in England if casually encounteringeach other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life ofthem cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for amoment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for awhile and resting in concert then how much more natural that uponthe illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea twowhaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earthofflone Fannings Island or the far away Kings Mills how much morenatural I say that under such circumstances these ships should notonly interchange hails but come into still closer more friendly andsociable contact  And especially would this seem to be a matter ofcourse in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whosecaptains officers and not a few of the men are personally known toeach other and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic thingsto talk aboutFor the long absent ship the outwardbounder perhaps has letterson board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papersof a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred andthumbworn files  And in return for that courtesy the outwardboundship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from thecruisingground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmostimportance to her  And in degree all this will hold true concerningwhaling vessels crossing each others track on the cruisinggrounditself even though they are equally long absent from home  For oneof them may have received a transfer of letters from some third andnow far remote vessel and some of those letters may be for thepeople of the ship she now meets  Besides they would exchange thewhaling news and have an agreeable chat  For not only would theymeet with all the sympathies of sailors but likewise with all thepeculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutuallyshared privations and perilsNor would difference of country make any very essential differencethat is so long as both parties speak one language as is the casewith Americans and English  Though to be sure from the smallnumber of English whalers such meetings do not very often occur andwhen they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness betweenthem for your Englishman is rather reserved and your Yankee hedoes not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself  Besidesthe English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitansuperiority over the American whalers regarding the long leanNantucketer with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort ofseapeasant  But where this superiority in the English whalemendoes really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the Yankeesin one day collectively kill more whales than all the Englishcollectively in ten years  But this is a harmless little foible inthe English whalehunters which the Nantucketer does not take muchto heart probably because he knows that he has a few foibleshimselfSo then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea thewhalers have most reason to be sociableand they are so  Whereassome merchant ships crossing each others wake in the midAtlanticwill oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word ofrecognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas like abrace of dandies in Broadway and all the time indulging perhaps infinical criticism upon each others rig  As for MenofWar whenthey chance to meet at sea they first go through such a string ofsilly bowings and scrapings such a ducking of ensigns that theredoes not seem to be much rightdown hearty goodwill and brotherlylove about it at all  As touching Slaveships meeting why they arein such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon aspossible  And as for Pirates when they chance to cross each otherscrossbones the first hail isHow many skullsthe same way thatwhalers hailHow many barrels  And that question once answeredpirates straightway steer apart for they are infernal villains onboth sides and dont like to see overmuch of each others villanouslikenessesBut look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociablefreeandeasy whaler  What does the whaler do when she meets anotherwhaler in any sort of decent weather  She has a GAM a thing soutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the nameeven and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at itand repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubberboilers andsuch like pretty exclamations  Why it is that all Merchantseamenand also all Pirates and ManofWars men and Slaveship sailorscherish such a scornful feeling towards Whaleships this is aquestion it would be hard to answer  Because in the case ofpirates say I should like to know whether that profession of theirshas any peculiar glory about it  It sometimes ends in uncommonelevation indeed but only at the gallows  And besides when a manis elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper foundation for hissuperior altitude  Hence I conclude that in boasting himself to behigh lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has nosolid basis to stand onBut what is a GAM  You might wear out your indexfinger running upand down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word  DrJohnson never attained to that erudition Noah Websters ark does nothold it  Nevertheless this same expressive word has now for manyyears been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true bornYankees  Certainly it needs a definition and should beincorporated into the Lexicon  With that view let me learnedlydefine itGAM  NOUNA SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO OR MORE WHALESHIPS GENERALLYON A CRUISINGGROUND WHEN AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS THEY EXCHANGEVISITS BY BOATS CREWS THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING FOR THE TIME ONBOARD OF ONE SHIP AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHERThere is another little item about Gamming which must not beforgotten here  All professions have their own little peculiaritiesof detail so has the whale fishery  In a pirate manofwar orslave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he alwayssits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seatthere and often steers himself with a pretty little millinerstiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons  But the whaleboat hasno seat astern no sofa of that sort whatever and no tiller at allHigh times indeed if whaling captains were wheeled about the wateron castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs  And as for atiller the whaleboat never admits of any such effeminacy andtherefore as in gamming a complete boats crew must leave the shipand hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number thatsubordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captainhaving no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standinglike a pine tree  And often you will notice that being conscious ofthe eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides ofthe two ships this standing captain is all alive to the importanceof sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs  Nor is this anyvery easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting steeringoar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the afteroarreciprocating by rapping his knees in front  He is thus completelywedged before and behind and can only expand himself sideways bysettling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent pitch ofthe boat will often go far to topple him because length offoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth  Merely make aspread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up  Thenagain it would never do in plain sight of the worlds riveted eyesit would never do I say for this straddling captain to be seensteadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anythingwith his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant selfcommandhe generally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhapsbeing generally very large heavy hands he carries them there forballast  Nevertheless there have occurred instances wellauthenticated ones too where the captain has been known for anuncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall sayto seizehold of the nearest oarsmans hair and hold on there like grimdeathCHAPTER 54The TownHos StoryAS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INNThe Cape of Good Hope and all the watery region round about thereis much like some noted four corners of a great highway where youmeet more travellers than in any other partIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that anotherhomewardbound whaleman the TownHo was encountered  She wasmanned almost wholly by Polynesians  In the short gam that ensuedshe gave us strong news of Moby Dick  To some the general interestin the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of theTownHos story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale acertain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so calledjudgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men  Thislatter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments formingwhat may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to benarrated never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates  Forthat secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of theTownHo himself  It was the private property of three confederatewhite seamen of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it toTashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy but the following nightTashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in thatway that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the restNevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on thoseseamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it and bysuch a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in thismatter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it nevertranspired abaft the Pequods mainmast  Interweaving in its properplace this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on theship the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put onlasting recordThe ancient whalecry upon first sighting a whale from themasthead still used by whalemen in hunting the famous GallipagosterrapinFor my humors sake I shall preserve the style in which I oncenarrated it at Lima to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends onesaints eve smoking upon the thickgilt tiled piazza of the GoldenInn  Of those fine cavaliers the young Dons Pedro and Sebastianwere on the closer terms with me and hence the interluding questionsthey occasionally put and which are duly answered at the timeSome two years prior to my first learning the events which I amabout rehearsing to you gentlemen the TownHo Sperm Whaler ofNantucket was cruising in your Pacific here not very many dayssail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn  She wassomewhere to the northward of the Line  One morning upon handlingthe pumps according to daily usage it was observed that she mademore water in her hold than common  They supposed a swordfish hadstabbed her gentlemen  But the captain having some unusual reasonfor believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes andtherefore being very averse to quit them and the leak not being thenconsidered at all dangerous though indeed they could not find itafter searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavyweather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariners workingat the pumps at wide and easy intervals but no good luck came moredays went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered but itsensibly increased  So much so that now taking some alarm thecaptain making all sail stood away for the nearest harbor among theislands there to have his hull hove out and repairedThough no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chancefavoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by theway because his pumps were of the best and being periodicallyrelieved at them those sixandthirty men of his could easily keepthe ship free never mind if the leak should double on her  Intruth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by veryprosperous breezes the TownHo had all but certainly arrived inperfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the leastfatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney themate a Vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilta Lakeman and desperado from BuffaloLakemanBuffalo  Pray what is a Lakeman and where is Buffalosaid Don Sebastian rising in his swinging mat of grassOn the eastern shore of our Lake Erie Don butI crave yourcourtesymay be you shall soon hear further of all that  Nowgentlemen in squaresail brigs and threemasted ships wellnigh aslarge and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to farManilla this Lakeman in the landlocked heart of our America hadyet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressionspopularly connected with the open ocean  For in their interflowingaggregate those grand freshwater seas of oursErie and Ontarioand Huron and Superior and Michiganpossess an oceanlikeexpansiveness with many of the oceans noblest traits with many ofits rimmed varieties of races and of climes  They contain roundarchipelagoes of romantic isles even as the Polynesian waters do inlarge part are shored by two great contrasting nations as theAtlantic is they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerousterritorial colonies from the East dotted all round their bankshere and there are frowned upon by batteries and by the goatlikecraggy guns of lofty Mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderingsof naval victories at intervals they yield their beaches to wildbarbarians whose red painted faces flash from out their peltrywigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unenteredforests where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings inGothic genealogies those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts ofprey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to TartarEmperors they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland aswell as Winnebago villages they float alike the fullrigged merchantship the armed cruiser of the State the steamer and the beechcanoe they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful asany that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are for outof sight of land however inland they have drowned full many amidnight ship with all its shrieking crew  Thus gentlemen thoughan inlander Steelkilt was wildocean born and wildocean nurturedas much of an audacious mariner as any  And for Radney though inhis infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach tonurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followedour austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific yet was he quiteas vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman freshfrom the latitudes of buckhorn handled bowieknives  Yet was thisNantucketer a man with some goodhearted traits and this Lakeman amariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexiblefirmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognitionwhich is the meanest slaves right thus treated this Steelkilt hadlong been retained harmless and docile  At all events he had provedso thus far but Radney was doomed and made mad and Steelkiltbutgentlemen you shall hearIt was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing herprow for her island haven that the TownHos leak seemed againincreasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumpsevery day  You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean likeour Atlantic for example some skippers think little of pumpingtheir whole way across it though of a still sleepy night shouldthe officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respectthe probability would be that he and his shipmates would never againremember it on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottomNor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westwardgentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging attheir pumphandles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerablelength that is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or ifany other reasonable retreat is afforded them  It is only when aleaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waterssome really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel alittle anxiousMuch this way had it been with the TownHo so when her leak wasfound gaining once more there was in truth some small concernmanifested by several of her company especially by Radney the mateHe commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anewand every way expanded to the breeze  Now this Radney I supposewas as little of a coward and as little inclined to any sort ofnervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearlessunthinking creature on land or on sea that you can convenientlyimagine gentlemen  Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude aboutthe safety of the ship some of the seamen declared that it was onlyon account of his being a part owner in her  So when they wereworking that evening at the pumps there was on this head no smallgamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood with their feetcontinually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear as anymountain spring gentlementhat bubbling from the pumps ran acrossthe deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the leescupperholesNow as you well know it is not seldom the case in thisconventional world of ourswatery or otherwise that when a personplaced in command over his fellowmen finds one of them to be verysignificantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightwayagainst that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike andbitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverizethat subalterns tower and make a little heap of dust of it  Bethis conceit of mine as it may gentlemen at all events Steelkiltwas a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman and a flowinggolden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroyssnorting charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in himgentlemen which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne had he been born sonto Charlemagnes father  But Radney the mate was ugly as a muleyet as hardy as stubborn as malicious  He did not love Steelkiltand Steelkilt knew itEspying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with therest the Lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went onwith his gay banteringsAye aye my merry lads its a lively leak this hold a cannikinone of ye and lets have a taste  By the Lord its worth bottlingI tell ye what men old Rads investment must go for it he hadbest cut away his part of the hull and tow it home  The fact isboys that swordfish only began the job hes come back again with agang of shipcarpenters sawfish and filefish and what not andthe whole posse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing atthe bottom making improvements I suppose  If old Rad were herenow Id tell him to jump overboard and scatter em  Theyre playingthe devil with his estate I can tell him  But hes a simple oldsoulRad and a beauty too  Boys they say the rest of hisproperty is invested in lookingglasses  I wonder if hed give apoor devil like me the model of his noseDamn your eyes whats that pump stopping for roared Radneypretending not to have heard the sailors talk  Thunder away atitAye aye sir said Steelkilt merry as a cricket  Lively boyslively now  And with that the pump clanged like fiftyfireengines the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long thatpeculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullesttension of lifes utmost energiesQuitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the Lakemanwent forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass hisface fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat fromhis brow  Now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessedRadney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperatedstate I know not but so it happened  Intolerably striding alongthe deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down theplanks and also a shovel and remove some offensive mattersconsequent upon allowing a pig to run at largeNow gentlemen sweeping a ships deck at sea is a piece ofhousehold work which in all times but raging gales is regularlyattended to every evening it has been known to be done in the caseof ships actually foundering at the time  Such gentlemen is theinflexibility of seausages and the instinctive love of neatness inseamen some of whom would not willingly drown without first washingtheir faces  But in all vessels this broom business is theprescriptive province of the boys if boys there be aboard  Besidesit was the stronger men in the TownHo that had been divided intogangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seamanof them all Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one ofthe gangs consequently he should have been freed from any trivialbusiness not connected with truly nautical duties such being thecase with his comrades  I mention all these particulars so that youmay understand exactly how this affair stood between the two menBut there was more than this the order about the shovel was almostas plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt as though Radney hadspat in his face  Any man who has gone sailor in a whaleship willunderstand this and all this and doubtless much more the Lakemanfully comprehended when the mate uttered his command  But as he satstill for a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the matesmalignant eye and perceived the stacks of powdercasks heaped up inhim and the slowmatch silently burning along towards them as heinstinctively saw all this that strange forbearance andunwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any alreadyireful beinga repugnance most felt when felt at all by reallyvaliant men even when aggrievedthis nameless phantom feelinggentlemen stole over SteelkiltTherefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodilyexhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying thatsweeping the deck was not his business and he would not do it  Andthen without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to threelads as the customary sweepers who not being billeted at thepumps had done little or nothing all day  To this Radney repliedwith an oath in a most domineering and outrageous mannerunconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon thestill seated Lakeman with an uplifted coopers club hammer which hehad snatched from a cask near byHeated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumpsfor all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweatingSteelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehowstill smothering the conflagration within him without speaking heremained doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensedRadney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face furiouslycommanding him to do his biddingSteelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadilyfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeatedhis intention not to obey  Seeing however that his forbearance hadnot the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation withhis twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but itwas to no purpose  And in this way the two went once slowly roundthe windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinkinghim that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor theLakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officerMr Radney I will not obey you  Take that hammer away or look toyourself  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to himwhere the Lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within aninch of his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferablemaledictions  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inchstabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glanceSteelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawingit back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheekhe Steelkilt would murder him  But gentlemen the fool had beenbranded for the slaughter by the gods  Immediately the hammertouched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate wasstove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whaleEre the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstaysleading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing theirmastheads  They were both CanallersCanallers cried Don Pedro  We have seen many whaleships in ourharbours but never heard of your Canallers  Pardon who and what aretheyCanallers Don are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie CanalYou must have heard of itNay Senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy andhereditary land we know but little of your vigorous NorthAye  Well then Don refill my cup  Your chichas very fine andere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are forsuch information may throw sidelight upon my storyFor three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through

noble Mohawk counties and especially by rows of snowwhitechapels whose spires stand almost like milestones flows onecontinual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless lifeTheres your true Ashantee gentlemen there howl your pagans whereyou ever find them next door to you under the longflung shadowand the snug patronising lee of churches  For by some curiousfatality as it is often noted

ofall us Limeese I but desire to express to you sir sailor that wehave by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting presentLima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison  Oh do not

Venice I have been there the holy cityof the blessed evangelist St MarkSt Dominic purge it  Yourcup  Thanks here I refill now you pour out againFreely depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the Canaller wouldmake a fine dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked ishe  Like Mark Antony for days and days along his greenturfedflowery Nile he indolently floats openly toying with hisredcheeked Cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunnydeck  But ashore all this effeminacy is dashed  The brigandishguise which the Canaller so proudly sports his slouched andgailyribboned hat betoken his grand features  A terror to thesmiling innocence of the villages through which he floats his swartvisage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities  Once a vagabondon his own canal I have received good turns from one of theseCanallers I thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but itis often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man ofviolence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poorstranger in a strait as to plunder a wealthy one  In sumgentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is emphaticallyevinced by this that our wild whalefishery contains so many of itsmost finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind exceptSydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captains  Nor doesit at all diminish the curiousness of this matter that to manythousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line theprobationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transitionbetween quietly reaping in a Christian cornfield and recklesslyploughing the waters of the most barbaric seasI see  I see impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro spilling hischicha upon his silvery ruffles  No need to travel  The worldsone Lima  I had thought now that at your temperate North thegenerations were cold and holy as the hillsBut the storyI left off gentlemen where the Lakeman shook the backstayHardly had he done so when he was surrounded by the three juniormates and the four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck  Butsliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two Canallers rushedinto the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards theforecastle  Others of the sailors joined with them in this attemptand a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harms way thevaliant captain danced up and down with a whalepike calling uponhis officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke himalong to the quarterdeck  At intervals he ran close up to therevolving border of the confusion and prying into the heart of itwith his pike sought to prick out the object of his resentment  ButSteelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all theysucceeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewingabout three or four large casks in a line with the windlass theseseaParisians entrenched themselves behind the barricadeCome out of that ye pirates roared the captain now menacingthem with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the stewardCome out of that ye cutthroatsSteelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down theredefied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain tounderstand distinctly that his Steelkilts death would be thesignal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands  Fearing inhis heart lest this might prove but too true the captain a littledesisted but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return totheir dutyWill you promise not to touch us if we do demanded theirringleaderTurn to turn toI make no promiseto your duty  Do you wantto sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this  Turn to andhe once more raised a pistolSink the ship cried Steelkilt  Aye let her sink  Not a man ofus turns to unless you swear not to raise a ropeyarn against usWhat say ye men turning to his comrades  A fierce cheer was theirresponseThe Lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping hiseye on the Captain and jerking out such sentences as theseItsnot our fault we didnt want it I told him to take his hammer awayit was boys business he might have known me before this I told himnot to prick the buffalo I believe I have broken a finger hereagainst his cursed jaw aint those mincing knives down in theforecastle there men look to those handspikes my heartiesCaptain by God look to yourself say the word dont be a foolforget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and wereyour men but we wont be floggedTurn to  I make no promises turn to I sayLook ye now cried the Lakeman flinging out his arm towards himthere are a few of us here and I am one of them who have shippedfor the cruise dye see now as you well know sir we can claim ourdischarge as soon as the anchor is down so we dont want a row itsnot our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work butwe wont be floggedTurn to roared the CaptainSteelkilt glanced round him a moment and then saidI tell youwhat it is now Captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such ashabby rascal we wont lift a hand against ye unless ye attack usbut till you say the word about not flogging us we dont do a handsturnDown into the forecastle then down with ye Ill keep ye theretill yere sick of it  Down ye goShall we cried the ringleader to his men  Most of them wereagainst it but at length in obedience to Steelkilt they precededhim down into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bearsinto a caveAs the Lakemans bare head was just level with the planks theCaptain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing overthe slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it andloudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlockbelonging to the companionwayThen opening the slide a little the Captain whispered something downthe crack closed it and turned the key upon themten innumberleaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far hadremained neutralAll night a wideawake watch was kept by all the officers forwardand aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchwayat which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge afterbreaking through the bulkhead below  But the hours of darknesspassed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toilinghard at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals throughthe dreary night dismally resounded through the shipAt sunrise the Captain went forward and knocking on the decksummoned the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused  Waterwas then lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuitwere tossed after it when again turning the key upon them andpocketing it the Captain returned to the quarterdeck  Twice everyday for three days this was repeated but on the fourth morning aconfused wrangling and then a scuffling was heard as the customarysummons was delivered and suddenly four men burst up from theforecastle saying they were ready to turn to  The fetid closenessof the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears ofultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender atdiscretion  Emboldened by this the Captain reiterated his demand tothe rest but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop hisbabbling and betake himself where he belonged  On the fifth morningthree others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from thedesperate arms below that sought to restrain them  Only three wereleftBetter turn to now said the Captain with a heartless jeerShut us up again will ye cried SteelkiltOh certainly the Captain and the key clickedIt was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection ofseven of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice thathad last hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a placeas black as the bowels of despair it was then that Steelkiltproposed to the two Canallers thus far apparently of one mind withhim to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of thegarrison and armed with their keen mincing knives long crescenticheavy implements with a handle at each end run amuck from thebowsprit to the taffrail and if by any devilishness of desperationpossible seize the ship  For himself he would do this he saidwhether they joined him or not  That was the last night he shouldspend in that den  But the scheme met with no opposition on the partof the other two they swore they were ready for that or for anyother mad thing for anything in short but a surrender  And what wasmore they each insisted upon being the first man on deck when thetime to make the rush should come  But to this their leader asfiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularlyas his two comrades would not yield the one to the other in thematter and both of them could not be first for the ladder would butadmit one man at a time  And here gentlemen the foul play of thesemiscreants must come outUpon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his ownseparate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the samepiece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out inorder to be the first of the three though the last of the ten tosurrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon suchconduct might merit  But when Steelkilt made known his determinationstill to lead them to the last they in some way by some subtlechemistry of villany mixed their before secret treacheries togetherand when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their soulsto each other in three sentences and bound the sleeper with cordsand gagged him with cords and shrieked out for the Captain atmidnightThinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood heand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastleIn a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and footthe still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by hisperfidious allies who at once claimed the honour of securing a manwho had been fully ripe for murder  But all these were collared anddragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by side wereseized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat andthere they hung till morning  Damn ye cried the Captain pacingto and fro before them the vultures would not touch ye yevillainsAt sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who hadrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told theformer that he had a good mind to flog them all roundthought uponthe whole he would do sohe ought tojustice demanded it but forthe present considering their timely surrender he would let them gowith a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacularBut as for you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in theriggingfor you I mean to mince ye up for the trypots andseizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of thetwo traitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung theirheads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawnMy wrist is sprained with ye he cried at last but there isstill rope enough left for you my fine bantam that wouldnt giveup  Take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can sayfor himselfFor a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of hiscramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in asort of hiss What I say is thisand mind it wellif you flog meI murder youSay ye so then see how ye frighten meand the Captain drew offwith the rope to strikeBest not hissed the LakemanBut I mustand the rope was once more drawn back for the strokeSteelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but theCaptain who to the amazement of all hands started back paced thedeck rapidly two or three times and then suddenly throwing down hisrope said I wont do itlet him gocut him down dye hearBut as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a paleman with a bandaged head arrested themRadney the chief mateEver since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morninghearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far hadwatched the whole scene  Such was the state of his mouth that hecould hardly speak but mumbling something about his being willingand able to do what the captain dared not attempt he snatched therope and advanced to his pinioned foeYou are a coward hissed the LakemanSo I am but take that  The mate was in the very act of strikingwhen another hiss stayed his uplifted arm  He paused and thenpausing no more made good his word spite of Steelkilts threatwhatever that might have been  The three men were then cut down allhands were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen theiron pumps clanged as beforeJust after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamorwas heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors runningup besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with thecrew  Entreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so attheir own instance they were put down in the ships run forsalvation  Still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest  Onthe contrary it seemed that mainly at Steelkilts instigation theyhad resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness obey all ordersto the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a bodyBut in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they allagreed to another thingnamely not to sing out for whales in caseany should be discovered  For spite of her leak and spite of all herother perils the TownHo still maintained her mastheads and hercaptain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment as onthe day his craft first struck the cruising ground and Radney the matewas quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with hisbandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whaleBut though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort ofpassiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least tillall was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon theman who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart  He was inRadney the chief mates watch and as if the infatuated man sought torun more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at therigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captainupon resuming the head of his watch at night  Upon this and one ortwo other circumstances Steelkilt systematically built the plan ofhis revengeDuring the night Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on thebulwarks of the quarterdeck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale ofthe boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ships sideIn this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed  There was aconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down betweenthis was the sea  Steelkilt calculated his time and found that hisnext trick at the helm would come round at two oclock in themorning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed  Athis leisure he employed the interval in braiding something verycarefully in his watches belowWhat are you making there said a shipmateWhat do you think what does it look likeLike a lanyard for your bag but its an odd one seems to meYes rather oddish said the Lakeman holding it at arms lengthbefore him but I think it will answer  Shipmate I havent enoughtwinehave you anyBut there was none in the forecastleThen I must get some from old Rad and he rose to go aftYou dont mean to go a begging to HIM said a sailorWhy not  Do you think he wont do me a turn when its to helphimself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked athim quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock  Itwas given himneither twine nor lanyard were seen again but thenext night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from thepocket of the Lakemans monkey jacket as he was tucking the coatinto his hammock for a pillow  Twentyfour hours after his trick atthe silent helmnigh to the man who was apt to doze over the gravealways ready dug to the seamans handthat fatal hour was then tocome and in the foreordaining soul of Steelkilt the mate wasalready stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushedinBut gentlemen a fool saved the wouldbe murderer from the bloodydeed he had planned  Yet complete revenge he had and without beingthe avenger  For by a mysterious fatality Heaven itself seemed tostep in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing hewould have doneIt was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of thesecond day when they were washing down the decks that a stupidTeneriffe man drawing water in the mainchains all at once shoutedout There she rolls there she rolls  Jesu what a whale  It wasMoby DickMoby Dick cried Don Sebastian St Dominic  Sir sailor but dowhales have christenings  Whom call you Moby DickA very white and famous and most deadly immortal monsterDonbut that would be too long a storyHow how cried all the young Spaniards crowdingNay Dons Donsnay nay  I cannot rehearse that now  Let me getmore into the air SirsThe chicha the chicha cried Don Pedro our vigorous friend looksfaintfill up his empty glassNo need gentlemen one moment and I proceedNow gentlemen sosuddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of theshipforgetful of the compact among the crewin the excitement ofthe moment the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarilylifted his voice for the monster though for some little time past ithad been plainly beheld from the three sullen mastheads  All wasnow a phrensy  The White Whalethe White Whale was the cry fromcaptain mates and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumourswere all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish while thedogged crew eyed askance and with curses the appalling beauty ofthe vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sunshifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning seaGentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of theseevents as if verily mapped out before the world itself was chartedThe mutineer was the bowsman of the mate and when fast to a fish itwas his duty to sit next him while Radney stood up with his lance inthe prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of commandMoreover when the four boats were lowered the mates got the startand none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt as hestrained at his oar  After a stiff pull their harpooneer got fastand spear in hand Radney sprang to the bow  He was always afurious man it seems in a boat  And now his bandaged cry was tobeach him on the whales topmost back  Nothing loath his bowsmanhauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent twowhitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as against asunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate  Thatinstant as he fell on the whales slippery back the boat rightedand was dashed aside by the swell while Radney was tossed over intothe sea on the other flank of the whale  He struck out through thespray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildlyseeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick  But the whalerushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between hisjaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and wentdownMeantime at the first tap of the boats bottom the Lakeman hadslackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmlylooking on he thought his own thoughts  But a sudden terrificdownward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the lineHe cut it and the whale was free  But at some distance Moby Dickrose again with some tatters of Radneys red woollen shirt caughtin the teeth that had destroyed him  All four boats gave chaseagain but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappearedIn good time the TownHo reached her porta savage solitaryplacewhere no civilized creature resided  There headed by theLakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberatelydeserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing alarge double warcanoe of the savages and setting sail for someother harborThe ships company being reduced to but a handful the captaincalled upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business ofheaving down the ship to stop the leak  But to such unrestingvigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whitesnecessitated both by night and by day and so extreme was the hardwork they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for seathey were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not putoff with them in so heavy a vessel  After taking counsel with hisofficers he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible loadedand ran out his two cannon from the bows stacked his muskets on thepoop and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at theirperil took one man with him and setting the sail of his bestwhaleboat steered straight before the wind for Tahiti five hundredmiles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crewOn the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried whichseemed to have touched at a low isle of corals  He steered away fromit but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice ofSteelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under waterThe captain presented a pistol  With one foot on each prow of theyoked warcanoes the Lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him thatif the pistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him inbubbles and foamWhat do you want of me cried the captainWhere are you bound and for what are you bound demandedSteelkilt no liesI am bound to Tahiti for more menVery good  Let me board you a momentI come in peace  With thathe leaped from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwalestood face to face with the captainCross your arms sir throw back your head  Now repeat after meAs soon as Steelkilt leaves me I swear to beach this boat on yonderisland and remain there six days  If I do not may lightning strikemeA pretty scholar laughed the Lakeman  Adios Senor andleaping into the sea he swam back to his comradesWatching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to theroots of the cocoanut trees Steelkilt made sail again and in duetime arrived at Tahiti his own place of destination  There luckbefriended him two ships were about to sail for France and wereprovidentially in want of precisely that number of men which thesailor headed  They embarked and so for ever got the start oftheir former captain had he been at all minded to work them legalretributionSome ten days after the French ships sailed the whaleboat arrivedand the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilizedTahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea  Chartering a smallnative schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding allright there again resumed his cruisingsWhere Steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island ofNantucket the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refusesto give up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale thatdestroyed himAre you through said Don Sebastian quietlyI am DonThen I entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictionsthis your story is in substance really true  It is so passingwonderful  Did you get it from an unquestionable source  Bear withme if I seem to pressAlso bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in DonSebastians suit cried the company with exceeding interestIs there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden InngentlemenNay said Don Sebastian but I know a worthy priest near by whowill quickly procure one for me  I go for it but are you welladvised this may grow too seriousWill you be so good as to bring the priest also DonThough there are no AutodaFes in Lima now said one of thecompany to another I fear our sailor friend runs risk of thearchiepiscopacy  Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight  I seeno need of thisExcuse me for running after you Don Sebastian but may I also begthat you will be particular in procuring the largest sizedEvangelists you canThis is the priest he brings you the Evangelists said DonSebastian gravely returning with a tall and solemn figureLet me remove my hat  Now venerable priest further into thelight and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch itSo help me Heaven and on my honour the story I have told yegentlemen is in substance and its great items true  I know it tobe true it happened on this ball I trod the ship I knew the crewI have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of RadneyCHAPTER 55Of the Monstrous Pictures of WhalesI shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvassomething like the true form of the whale as he actually appears tothe eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale ismoored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped uponthere  It may be worth while therefore previously to advert tothose curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to thepresent day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman  It istime to set the world right in this matter by proving such picturesof the whale all wrongIt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusionswill be found among the oldest Hindoo Egyptian and Greciansculptures  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous timeswhen on the marble panellings of temples the pedestals of statuesand on shields medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn inscales of chainarmor like Saladins and a helmeted head like StGeorges ever since then has something of the same sort of licenseprevailed not only in most popular pictures of the whale but inmany scientific presentations of himNow by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purportingto be the whales is to be found in the famous cavernpagoda ofElephanta in India  The Brahmins maintain that in the almostendless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades andpursuits every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured agesbefore any of them actually came into being  No wonder then that insome sort our noble profession of whaling should have been thereshadowed forth  The Hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separatedepartment of the wall depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in theform of leviathan learnedly known as the Matse Avatar  But thoughthis sculpture is half man and half whale so as only to give thetail of the latter yet that small section of him is all wrong  Itlooks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palmsof the true whales majestic flukesBut go to the old Galleries and look now at a great Christianpainters portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than theantediluvian Hindoo  It is Guidos picture of Perseus rescuingAndromeda from the seamonster or whale  Where did Guido get themodel of such a strange creature as that  Nor does Hogarth inpainting the same scene in his own Perseus Descending make out onewhit better  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monsterundulates on the surface scarcely drawing one inch of water  It hasa sort of howdah on its back and its distended tusked mouth intowhich the billows are rolling might be taken for the Traitors Gateleading from the Thames by water into the Tower  Then there are theProdromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald and Jonahs whale asdepicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primersWhat shall be said of these  As for the bookbinders whale windinglike a vinestalk round the stock of a descending anchoras stampedand gilded on the backs and titlepages of many books both old andnewthat is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creatureimitated I take it from the like figures on antique vases  Thoughuniversally denominated a dolphin I nevertheless call thisbookbinders fish an attempt at a whale because it was so intendedwhen the device was first introduced  It was introduced by an oldItalian publisher somewhere about the 15th century during theRevival of Learning and in those days and even down to acomparatively late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be aspecies of the LeviathanIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books youwill at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where allmanner of spouts jets deau hot springs and cold Saratoga andBadenBaden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain  In thetitlepage of the original edition of the Advancement of Learningyou will find some curious whalesBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance atthose pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientificdelineations by those who know  In old Harriss collection ofvoyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch bookof voyages AD 1671 entitled A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen inthe ship Jonas in the Whale Peter Peterson of Friesland masterIn one of those plates the whales like great rafts of logs arerepresented lying among iceisles with white bears running overtheir living backs  In another plate the prodigious blunder is madeof representing the whale with perpendicular flukesThen again there is an imposing quarto written by one CaptainColnett a Post Captain in the English navy entitled A Voyage roundCape Horn into the South Seas for the purpose of extending theSpermaceti Whale Fisheries  In this book is an outline purportingto be a Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale drawn by scalefrom one killed on the coast of Mexico August 1793 and hoisted ondeck  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken forthe benefit of his marines  To mention but one thing about it letme say that it has an eye which applied according to theaccompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eyeof that whale a bowwindow some five feet long  Ah my gallantcaptain why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eyeNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History forthe benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousnessof mistake  Look at that popular work Goldsmiths Animated NatureIn the abridged London edition of 1807 there are plates of analleged whale and a narwhale  I do not wish to seem inelegantbut this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow and asfor the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that inthis nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuineupon any intelligent public of schoolboysThen again in 1825 Bernard Germain Count de Lacepede a greatnaturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein areseveral pictures of the different species of the Leviathan  Allthese are not only incorrect but the picture of the Mysticetus orGreenland whale that is to say the Right whale even Scoresby along experienced man as touching that species declares not to haveits counterpart in natureBut the placing of the capsheaf to all this blundering business wasreserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier brother to the famousBaron  In 1836 he published a Natural History of Whales in whichhe gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale  Before showingthat picture to any Nantucketer you had best provide for yoursummary retreat from Nantucket  In a word Frederick Cuviers SpermWhale is not a Sperm Whale but a squash  Of course he never hadthe benefit of a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence hederived that picture who can tell  Perhaps he got it as hisscientific predecessor in the same field Desmarest got one of hisauthentic abortions that is from a Chinese drawing  And what sortof lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are many queer cups andsaucers inform usAs for the signpainters whales seen in the streets hanging over theshops of oildealers what shall be said of them  They are generallyRichard III whales with dromedary humps and very savagebreakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats fullof mariners their deformities floundering in seas of blood and bluepaintBut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so verysurprising after all  Consider  Most of the scientific drawingshave been taken from the stranded fish and these are about ascorrect as a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back wouldcorrectly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed prideof hull and spars  Though elephants have stood for theirfulllengths the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floatedhimself for his portrait  The living whale in his full majesty andsignificance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters andafloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launchedlineofbattle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternallyimpossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so as topreserve all his mighty swells and undulations  And not to speak ofthe highly presumable difference of contour between a young suckingwhale and a fullgrown Platonian Leviathan yet even in the case ofone of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ships deck such isthen the outlandish eellike limbered varying shape of him thathis precise expression the devil himself could not catchBut it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the strandedwhale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form  Not atall  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathanthat his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shapeThough Jeremy Benthams skeleton which hangs for candelabra in thelibrary of one of his executors correctly conveys the idea of aburlybrowed utilitarian old gentleman with all Jeremys otherleading personal characteristics yet nothing of this kind could beinferred from any leviathans articulated bones  In fact as thegreat Hunter says the mere skeleton of the whale bears the samerelation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect doesto the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it  This peculiarityis strikingly evinced in the head as in some part of this book willbe incidentally shown  It is also very curiously displayed in theside fin the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of thehuman hand minus only the thumb  This fin has four regularbonefingers the index middle ring and little finger  But allthese are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as the humanfingers in an artificial covering  However recklessly the whale maysometimes serve us said humorous Stubb one day he can never betruly said to handle us without mittensFor all these reasons then any way you may look at it you mustneeds conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in theworld which must remain unpainted to the last  True one portraitmay hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it withany very considerable degree of exactness  So there is no earthlyway of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like  Andthe only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of hisliving contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing yourun no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by himWherefore it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in yourcuriosity touching this LeviathanCHAPTER 56Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures ofWhaling ScenesIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales I am stronglytempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of themwhich are to be found in certain books both ancient and modernespecially in Pliny Purchas Hackluyt Harris Cuvier etc  But Ipass that matter byI know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm WhaleColnetts Hugginss Frederick Cuviers and Beales  In theprevious chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to  Hugginssis far better than theirs but by great odds Beales is the bestAll Beales drawings of this whale are good excepting the middlefigure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes cappinghis second chapter  His frontispiece boats attacking Sperm Whalesthough no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of someparlor men is admirably correct and lifelike in its general effectSome of the Sperm Whale drawings in J  Ross Browne are prettycorrect in contour but they are wretchedly engraved  That is nothis fault thoughOf the Right Whale the best outline pictures are in Scoresby butthey are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impressionHe has but one picture of whaling scenes and this is a saddeficiency because it is by such pictures only when at all welldone that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the livingwhale as seen by his living huntersBut taken for all in all by far the finest though in some detailsnot the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes tobe anywhere found are two large French engravings well executedand taken from paintings by one Garnery  Respectively theyrepresent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale  In the firstengraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of mightjust risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean andbearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of thestoven planks  The prow of the boat is partially unbroken and isdrawn just balancing upon the monsters spine and standing in thatprow for that one single incomputable flash of time you behold anoarsman half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whaleand in the act of leaping as if from a precipice  The action of thewhole thing is wonderfully good and true  The halfemptied linetubfloats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoonsobliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scatteredabout the whale in contrasting expressions of affright while in theblack stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the sceneSerious fault might be found with the anatomical details of thiswhale but let that pass since for the life of me I could not drawso good a oneIn the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongsidethe barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale that rolls hisblack weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rockslide from thePatagonian cliffs  His jets are erect full and black like soot sothat from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think theremust be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below  Sea fowlsare pecking at the small crabs shellfish and other sea candies andmaccaroni which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilentback  And all the while the thicklipped leviathan is rushingthrough the deep leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wakeand causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caughtnigh the paddlewheels of an ocean steamer  Thus the foreground isall raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast isthe glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails ofthe powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conqueredfortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whalepoleinserted into his spoutholeWho Garnery the painter is or was I know not  But my life for ithe was either practically conversant with his subject or elsemarvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman  The French arethe lads for painting action  Go and gaze upon all the paintings ofEurope and where will you find such a gallery of living andbreathing commotion on canvas as in that triumphal hall atVersailles where the beholder fights his way pellmell through theconsecutive great battles of France where every sword seems a flashof the Northern Lights and the successive armed kings and Emperorsdash by like a charge of crowned centaurs  Not wholly unworthy of aplace in that gallery are these sea battlepieces of GarneryThe natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness ofthings seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings andengravings they have of their whaling scenes  With not one tenth ofEnglands experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part ofthat of the Americans they have nevertheless furnished both nationswith the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the realspirit of the whale hunt  For the most part the English andAmerican whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting themechanical outline of things such as the vacant profile of thewhale which so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned isabout tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid  EvenScoresby the justly renowned Right whaleman after giving us a stifffull length of the Greenland whale and three or four delicateminiatures of narwhales and porpoises treats us to a series ofclassical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives and grapnelsand with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to theinspection of a shivering world ninetysix facsimiles of magnifiedArctic snow crystals  I mean no disparagement to the excellentvoyager I honour him for a veteran but in so important a matter itwas certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal asworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the PeaceIn addition to those fine engravings from Garnery there are twoother French engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribeshimself H  Durand  One of them though not precisely adapted toour present purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accountsIt is a quiet noonscene among the isles of the Pacific a Frenchwhaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water onboard the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of thepalms in the background both drooping together in the breezelessair  The effect is very fine when considered with reference to itspresenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects oforiental repose  The other engraving is quite a different affairthe ship hoveto upon the open sea and in the very heart of theLeviathanic life with a Right Whale alongside the vessel in theact of cuttingin hove over to the monster as if to a quay and aboat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is aboutgiving chase to whales in the distance  The harpoons and lances lielevelled for use three oarsmen are just setting the mast in itshole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft standshalferect out of the water like a rearing horse  From the shipthe smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like thesmoke over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloudrising up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken theactivity of the excited seamenCHAPTER 57Of Whales in Paint in Teeth in Wood in SheetIron in Stone inMountains in StarsOn Towerhill as you go down to the London docks you may have seena crippled beggar or KEDGER as the sailors say holding a paintedboard before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost hisleg  There are three whales and three boats and one of the boatspresumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrityis being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale  Any time theseten years they tell me has that man held up that picture andexhibited that stump to an incredulous world  But the time of hisjustification has now come  His three whales are as good whales aswere ever published in Wapping at any rate and his stump asunquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearingsBut though for ever mounted on that stump never a stumpspeechdoes the poor whaleman make but with downcast eyes stands ruefullycontemplating his own amputationThroughout the Pacific and also in Nantucket and New Bedford andSag Harbor you will come across lively sketches of whales andwhalingscenes graven by the fishermen themselves on SpermWhaleteeth or ladies busks wrought out of the Right Whaleboneand other like skrimshander articles as the whalemen call thenumerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out ofthe rough material in their hours of ocean leisure  Some of themhave little boxes of dentisticallooking implements speciallyintended for the skrimshandering business  But in general theytoil with their jackknives alone and with that almost omnipotenttool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please inthe way of a mariners fancyLong exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores aman to that condition in which God placed him ie what is calledsavagery  Your true whalehunter is as much a savage as an IroquoisI myself am a savage owning no allegiance but to the King of theCannibals and ready at any moment to rebel against himNow one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in hisdomestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry  An ancientHawaiian warclub or spearpaddle in its full multiplicity andelaboration of carving is as great a trophy of human perseverance asa Latin lexicon  For with but a bit of broken seashell or asharks tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden network has beenachieved and it has cost steady years of steady applicationAs with the Hawaiian savage so with the white sailorsavage  Withthe same marvellous patience and with the same single sharks toothof his one poor jackknife he will carve you a bit of bonesculpture not quite as workmanlike but as close packed in itsmaziness of design as the Greek savage Achilless shield and fullof barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prints of that fine oldDutch savage Albert DurerWooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabsof the noble South Sea warwood are frequently met with in theforecastles of American whalers  Some of them are done with muchaccuracyAt some old gableroofed country houses you will see brass whaleshung by the tail for knockers to the roadside door  When the porteris sleepy the anvilheaded whale would be best  But these knockingwhales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays  On the spires ofsome oldfashioned churches you will see sheetiron whales placedthere for weathercocks but they are so elevated and besides thatare to all intents and purposes so labelled with HANDS OFF youcannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their meritIn bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high brokencliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon theplain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms ofthe Leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day breaksagainst them in a surf of green surgesThen again in mountainous countries where the traveller iscontinually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there fromsome lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of theprofiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges  But you mustbe a thorough whaleman to see these sights and not only that butif you wish to return to such a sight again you must be sure andtake the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your firststandpoint else so chancelike are such observations of the hillsthat your precise previous standpoint would require a laboriousrediscovery like the Soloma Islands which still remain incognitathough once highruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuerachronicled themNor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to traceout great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of themas when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations sawarmies locked in battle among the clouds  Thus at the North have Ichased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of thebright points that first defined him to me  And beneath theeffulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the ArgoNavis and joinedthe chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch ofHydrus and the Flying FishWith a frigates anchors for my bridlebitts and fasces of harpoonsfor spurs would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skiesto see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tentsreally lie encamped beyond my mortal sightCHAPTER 58BritSteering northeastward from the Crozetts we fell in with vastmeadows of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the RightWhale largely feeds  For leagues and leagues it undulated round usso that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe andgolden wheatOn the second day numbers of Right Whales were seen who securefrom the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod with open jawssluggishly swam through the brit which adhering to the fringingfibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths was in thatmanner separated from the water that escaped at the lipAs morning mowers who side by side slowly and seethingly advancetheir scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even sothese monsters swam making a strange grassy cutting sound andleaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow seaThat part of the sea known among whalemen as the Brazil Banks doesnot bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do because of therebeing shallows and soundings there but because of this remarkablemeadowlike appearance caused by the vast drifts of brit continuallyfloating in those latitudes where the Right Whale is often chasedBut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which atall reminded one of mowers  Seen from the mastheads especiallywhen they paused and were stationary for a while their vast blackforms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything elseAnd as in the great hunting countries of India the stranger at adistance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephantswithout knowing them to be such taking them for bare blackenedelevations of the soil even so often with him who for the firsttime beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea  And evenwhen recognised at last their immense magnitude renders it veryhard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth canpossibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort of life thatlives in a dog or a horseIndeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of thedeep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore  Forthough some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of theland are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad generalview of the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialtieswhere for example does the ocean furnish any fish that indisposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog  Theaccursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bearcomparative analogy to himBut though to landsmen in general the native inhabitants of theseas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial andrepelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terraincognita so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds todiscover his one superficial western one though by vast odds themost terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially andindiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those whohave gone upon the waters though but a moments consideration willteach that however baby man may brag of his science and skill andhowever much in a flattering future that science and skill mayaugment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the seawill insult and murder him and pulverize the stateliest stiffestfrigate he can make nevertheless by the continual repetition ofthese very impressions man has lost that sense of the full awfulnessof the sea which aboriginally belongs to itThe first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with Portuguesevengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as awidow  That same ocean rolls now that same ocean destroyed thewrecked ships of last year  Yea foolish mortals Noahs flood isnot yet subsided two thirds of the fair world it yet coversWherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle upon one is not amiracle upon the other  Preternatural terrors rested upon theHebrews when under the feet of Korah and his company the live groundopened and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun eversets but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up shipsand crewsBut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it butit is also a fiend to its own offspring worse than the Persian hostwho murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itselfhath spawned  Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungleoverlays her own cubs so the sea dashes even the mightiest whalesagainst the rocks and leaves them there side by side with the splitwrecks of ships  No mercy no power but its own controls itPanting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its riderthe masterless ocean overruns the globeConsider the subtleness of the sea how its most dreaded creaturesglide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherouslyhidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure  Consider also thedevilish

strange analogy to something in yourself  For as thisappalling ocean surrounds the verdant land so in the soul of manthere lies one insular Tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassedby all the horrors of the half known life  God keep thee  Push notoff from that isle thou canst never returnCHAPTER 59SquidSlowly wading through the meadows of brit the Pequod still held onher way northeastward towards the island of Java a gentle airimpelling her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her threetall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze as threemild palms on a plain  And still at wide intervals in the silverynight the lonely alluring jet would be seenBut one transparent blue morning when a stillness almostpreternatural spread over the sea however unattended with anystagnant calm when the long burnished sunglade on the waters seemeda golden finger laid across them enjoining some secrecy when theslippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on in thisprofound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen byDaggoo from the mainmastheadIn the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higherand higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamedbefore our prow like a snowslide new slid from the hills  Thusglistening for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank  Then oncemore arose and silently gleamed  It seemed not a whale and yet isthis Moby Dick thought Daggoo  Again the phantom went down but onreappearing once more with a stilettolike cry that startled everyman from his nod the negro yelled outThere there again thereshe breaches right ahead  The White Whale the White WhaleUpon this the seamen rushed to the yardarms as in swarmingtimethe bees rush to the boughs  Bareheaded in the sultry sun Ahabstood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind inreadiness to wave his orders to the helmsman cast his eager glancein the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless armof DaggooWhether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet hadgradually worked upon Ahab so that he was now prepared to connectthe ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of theparticular whale he pursued however this was or whether hiseagerness betrayed him whichever way it might have been no soonerdid he distinctly perceive the white mass than with a quickintensity he instantly gave orders for loweringThe four boats were soon on the water Ahabs in advance and allswiftly pulling towards their prey  Soon it went down and whilewith oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in thesame spot where it sank once more it slowly rose  Almost forgettingfor the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick we now gazed at the mostwondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed tomankind  A vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of aglancing creamcolour lay floating on the water innumerable longarms radiating from its centre and curling and twisting like a nestof anacondas as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object withinreach  No perceptible face or front did it have no conceivabletoken of either sensation or instinct but undulated there on thebillows an unearthly formless chancelike apparition of lifeAs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again Starbuckstill gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wildvoice exclaimedAlmost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought himthan to have seen thee thou white ghostWhat was it Sir said FlaskThe great live squid which they say few whaleships ever beheldand returned to their ports to tell of itBut Ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to thevessel the rest as silently followingWhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connectedwith the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of itbeing so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest itwith portentousness  So rarely is it beheld that though one and allof them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yetvery few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning itstrue nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish tothe sperm whale his only food  For though other species of whalesfind their food above water and may be seen by man in the act offeeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zonesbelow the surface and only by inference is it that any one can tellof what precisely that food consists  At times when closelypursued he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached armsof the squid some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirtyfeet in length  They fancy that the monster to which these armsbelonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean and thatthe sperm whale unlike other species is supplied with teeth inorder to attack and tear itThere seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of BishopPontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid  The manner inwhich the Bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinkingwith some other particulars he narrates in all this the twocorrespond  But much abatement is necessary with respect to theincredible bulk he assigns itBy some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysteriouscreature here spoken of it is included among the class ofcuttlefish to which indeed in certain external respects it wouldseem to belong but only as the Anak of the tribeCHAPTER 60The LineWith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as wellas for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewherepresented I have here to speak of the magical sometimes horriblewhalelineThe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hempslightly vapoured with tar not impregnated with it as in the case ofordinary ropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hempmore pliable to the ropemaker and also renders the rope itself moreconvenient to the sailor for common ship use yet not only would theordinary quantity too much stiffen the whaleline for the closecoiling to which it must be subjected but as most seamen arebeginning to learn tar in general by no means adds to the ropesdurability or strength however much it may give it compactness andglossOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almostentirely superseded hemp as a material for whalelines for thoughnot so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft andelastic and I will add since there is an aesthetics in all thingsis much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp  Hemp is adusky dark fellow a sort of Indian but Manilla is as agoldenhaired Circassian to beholdThe whaleline is only twothirds of an inch in thickness  At firstsight you would not think it so strong as it really is  Byexperiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of onehundred and twenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strainnearly equal to three tons  In length the common sperm whalelinemeasures something over two hundred fathoms  Towards the stern ofthe boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub not like thewormpipe of a still though but so as to form one roundcheeseshaped mass of densely bedded sheaves or layers ofconcentric spiralizations without any hollow but the heart orminute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese  As the leasttangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly takesomebodys arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution isused in stowing the line in its tub  Some harpooneers will consumealmost an entire morning in this business carrying the line highaloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tubso as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles andtwistsIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one the same linebeing continuously coiled in both tubs  There is some advantage inthis because these twintubs being so small they fit more readilyinto the boat and do not strain it so much whereas the Americantub nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makesa rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one halfinchin thickness for the bottom of the whaleboat is like critical icewhich will bear up a considerable distributed weight but not verymuch of a concentrated one  When the painted canvas cover is clappedon the American linetub the boat looks as if it were pulling offwith a prodigious great weddingcake to present to the whalesBoth ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in aneyesplice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of thetub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everythingThis arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accountsFirst In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additionalline from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should soundso deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originallyattached to the harpoon  In these instances the whale of course isshifted like a mug of ale as it were from the one boat to theother though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist itsconsort  Second This arrangement is indispensable for commonsafetys sake for were the lower end of the line in any way attachedto the boat and were the whale then to run the line out to the endalmost in a single smoking minute as he sometimes does he would notstop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged downafter him into the profundity of the sea and in that case notowncrier would ever find her againBefore lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line istaken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there isagain carried forward the entire length of the boat restingcrosswise upon the loom or handle of every mans oar so that it jogsagainst his wrist in rowing and also passing between the men asthey alternately sit at the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocksor grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a woodenpin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slippingout  From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows andis then passed inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathomscalled boxline being coiled upon the box in the bows it continuesits way to the gunwale still a little further aft and is thenattached to the shortwarpthe rope which is immediately connectedwith the harpoon but previous to that connexion the shortwarp goesthrough sundry mystifications too tedious to detailThus the whaleline folds the whole boat in its complicated coilstwisting and writhing around it in almost every direction  All theoarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to thetimid eye of the landsman they seem as Indian jugglers with thedeadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs  Nor can any sonof mortal woman for the first time seat himself amid those hempenintricacies and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink himthat at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all thesehorrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings he cannotbe thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow inhis bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly  Yet habitstrangething what cannot habit accomplishGayer sallies more merrymirth better jokes and brighter repartees you never heard overyour mahogany than you will hear over the halfinch white cedar ofthe whaleboat when thus hung in hangmans nooses and like the sixburghers of Calais before King Edward the six men composing the crewpull into the jaws of death with a halter around every neck as youmay sayPerhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account forthose repeated whaling disasterssome few of which are casuallychronicledof this man or that man being taken out of the boat bythe line and lost  For when the line is darting out to be seatedthen in the boat is like being seated in the midst of the manifoldwhizzings of a steamengine in full play when every flying beam andshaft and wheel is grazing you  It is worse for you cannot sitmotionless in the heart of these perils because the boat is rockinglike a cradle and you are pitched one way and the other without theslightest warning and only by a certain selfadjusting buoyancy andsimultaneousness of volition and action can you escape being made aMazeppa of and run away with where the allseeing sun himself couldnever pierce you outAgain as the profound calm which only apparently precedes andprophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itselffor indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the stormand contains it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifle holds thefatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful reposeof the line as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen beforebeing brought into actual playthis is a thing which carries more oftrue terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair  But whysay more  All men live enveloped in whalelines  All are born withhalters round their necks but it is only when caught in the swiftsudden turn of death that mortals realize the silent subtleeverpresent perils of life  And if you be a philosopher thoughseated in the whaleboat you would not at heart feel one whit moreof terror than though seated before your evening fire with a pokerand not a harpoon by your sideCHAPTER 61Stubb Kills a WhaleIf to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portentsto Queequeg it was quite a different objectWhen you see him quid said the savage honing his harpoon in thebow of his hoisted boat then you quick see him parm whaleThe next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with nothingspecial to engage them the Pequods crew could hardly resist thespell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea  For this part of theIndian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemencall a lively ground that is it affords fewer glimpses ofporpoises dolphins flyingfish and other vivacious denizens ofmore stirring waters than those off the Rio de la Plata or theinshore ground off PeruIt was my turn to stand at the foremasthead and with my shouldersleaning against the slackened royal shrouds to and fro I idly swayedin what seemed an enchanted air  No resolution could withstand itin that dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul wentout of my body though my body still continued to sway as a pendulumwill long after the power which first moved it is withdrawnEre forgetfulness altogether came over me I had noticed that theseamen at the main and mizzenmastheads were already drowsy  Sothat at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars and forevery swing that we made there was a nod from below from theslumbering helmsman  The waves too nodded their indolent crestsand across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and thesun over allSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vicesmy hands grasped the shrouds some invisible gracious agencypreserved me with a shock I came back to life  And lo close underour lee not forty fathoms off a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling inthe water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossyback of an Ethiopian hue glistening in the suns rays like amirror  But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever andanon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet the whale looked like aportly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon  But that pipepoor whale was thy last  As if struck by some enchanters wand thesleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started intowakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts of thevessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted forththe accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spoutedthe sparkling brine into the airClear away the boats  Luff cried Ahab  And obeying his ownorder he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle thespokesThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale andere the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to theleeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so fewripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet bealarmed Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no manmust speak but in whispers  So seated like Ontario Indians on thegunwales of the boats we swiftly but silently paddled along thecalm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set  Presently aswe thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tailforty feet into the air and then sank out of sight like a towerswallowed upThere go flukes was the cry an announcement immediately followedby Stubbs producing his match and igniting his pipe for now arespite was granted  After the full interval of his sounding hadelapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of thesmokers boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others Stubbcounted upon the honour of the capture  It was obvious now that thewhale had at length become aware of his pursuers  All silence ofcautiousness was therefore no longer of use  Paddles were droppedand oars came loudly into play  And still puffing at his pipe Stubbcheered on his crew to the assaultYes a mighty change had come over the fish  All alive to hisjeopardy he was going head out that part obliquely projectingfrom the mad yeast which he brewedIt will be seen in some other place of what a very light substancethe entire interior of the sperm whales enormous head consistsThough apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyantpart about him  So that with ease he elevates it in the air andinvariably does so when going at his utmost speed  Besides such isthe breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such thetapering cutwater formation of the lower part that by obliquelyelevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself froma bluffbowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New YorkpilotboatStart her start her my men  Dont hurry yourselves take plentyof timebut start her start her like thunderclaps thats allcried Stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke  Start her nowgive em the long and strong stroke Tashtego  Start her Tash myboystart her all but keep cool keep coolcucumbers is thewordeasy easyonly start her like grim death and grinning devilsand raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their gravesboysthats all  Start herWoohoo  Wahee screamed the GayHeader in reply raising someold warwhoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boatinvoluntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading strokewhich the eager Indian gaveBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wildKeehee  Keehee yelled Daggoo straining forwards and backwardson his seat like a pacing tiger in his cageKala  Kooloo howled Queequeg as if smacking his lips over amouthful of Grenadiers steak  And thus with oars and yells thekeels cut the sea  Meanwhile Stubb retaining his place in thevan still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing thesmoke from his mouth  Like desperadoes they tugged and theystrained till the welcome cry was heardStand up Tashtegogiveit to him  The harpoon was hurled  Stern all  The oarsmenbacked water the same moment something went hot and hissing alongevery one of their wrists  It was the magical line  An instantbefore Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it roundthe loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings ahempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumesfrom his pipe  As the line passed round and round the loggerhead soalso just before reaching that point it blisteringly passed throughand through both of Stubbs hands from which the handcloths orsquares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times hadaccidentally dropped  It was like holding an enemys sharp twoedgedsword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to wrest itout of your clutchWet the line wet the line cried Stubb to the tub oarsman himseated by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed seawater intoit  More turns were taken so that the line began holding its placeThe boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all finsStubb and Tashtego here changed placesstem for sterna staggeringbusiness truly in that rocking commotionPartly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here bestated that in the old Dutch fishery a mop was used to dash therunning line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin orbailer is set apart for that purpose  Your hat however is themost convenientFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper partof the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring youwould have thought the craft had two keelsone cleaving the waterthe other the airas the boat churned on through both opposingelements at once  A continual cascade played at the bows aceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motionfrom within even but of a little finger the vibrating crackingcraft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea  Thus theyrushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to preventbeing tossed to the foam and the tall form of Tashtego at thesteering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down hiscentre of gravity  Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed asthey shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackenedhis flightHaul inhaul in cried Stubb to the bowsman and facing roundtowards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him whileyet the boat was being towed on  Soon ranging up by his flankStubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dartafter dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boatalternately sterning out of the way of the whales horrible wallowand then ranging up for another flingThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooksdown a hill  His tormented body rolled not in brine but in bloodwhich bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake  Theslanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent backits reflection into every face so that they all glowed to each otherlike red men  And all the while jet after jet of white smoke wasagonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puffafter puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every darthauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it Stubbstraightened it again and again by a few rapid blows against thegunwale then again and again sent it into the whalePull uppull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whalerelaxed in his wrath  Pull upclose to and the boat rangedalong the fishs flank  When reaching far over the bow Stubb slowlychurned his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it therecarefully churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feelafter some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and whichhe was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out  But that goldwatch he sought was the innermost life of the fish  And now it isstruck for starting from his trance into that unspeakable thingcalled his flurry the monster horribly wallowed in his bloodoverwrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that theimperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado blindly tostruggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of thedayAnd now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out intoview surging from side to side spasmodically dilating andcontracting his spouthole with sharp cracking agonizedrespirations  At last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if ithad been the purple lees of red wine shot into the frighted air andfalling back again ran dripping down his motionless flanks intothe sea  His heart had burstHes dead Mr Stubb said DaggooYes both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouthStubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a momentstood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had madeCHAPTER 62The DartA word concerning an incident in the last chapterAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery the whaleboatpushes off from the ship with the headsman or whalekiller astemporary steersman and the harpooneer or whalefastener pulling theforemost oar the one known as the harpooneeroar  Now it needs astrong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish foroften in what is called a long dart the heavy implement has to beflung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet  But howeverprolonged and exhausting the chase the harpooneer is expected topull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed he is expected toset an example of superhuman activity to the rest not only byincredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamationsand what it is to keep shouting at the top of ones compass whileall the other muscles are strained and half startedwhat that isnone know but those who have tried it  For one I cannot bawl veryheartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time  In thisstraining bawling state then with his back to the fish all atonce the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cryStand up andgive it to him  He now has to drop and secure his oar turn roundon his centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and withwhat little strength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow intothe whale  No wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a bodythat out of fifty fair chances for a dart not five are successfulno wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed anddisrated no wonder that some of them actually burst theirbloodvessels in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen areabsent four years with four barrels no wonder that to many shipowners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneerthat makes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body howcan you expect to find it there when most wantedAgain if the dart be successful then at the second criticalinstant that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader andharpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminentjeopardy of themselves and every one else  It is then they changeplaces and the headsman the chief officer of the little crafttakes his proper station in the bows of the boatNow I care not who maintains the contrary but all this is bothfoolish and unnecessary  The headsman should stay in the bows fromfirst to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and norowing whatever should be expected of him except under circumstancesobvious to any fisherman  I know that this would sometimes involve aslight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in variouswhalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vastmajority of failures in the fishery it has not by any means been somuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of theharpooneer that has caused themTo insure the greatest efficiency in the dart the harpooneers ofthis world must start to their feet from out of idleness and notfrom out of toilCHAPTER 63The CrotchOut of the trunk the branches grow out of them the twigs  So inproductive subjects grow the chaptersThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independentmention  It is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet inlength which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwalenear the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the woodenextremity of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopinglyprojects from the prow  Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand toits hurler who snatches it up as readily from its rest as abackwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall  It is customary to havetwo harpoons reposing in the crotch respectively called the firstand second ironsBut these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected withthe line the object being this to dart them both if possible oneinstantly after the other into the same whale so that if in thecoming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a holdIt is a doubling of the chances  But it very often happens thatowing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whaleupon receiving the first iron it becomes impossible for theharpooneer however lightninglike in his movements to pitch thesecond iron into him  Nevertheless as the second iron is alreadyconnected with the line and the line is running hence that weaponmust at all events be anticipatingly tossed out of the boatsomehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involveall hands  Tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such casesthe spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter makingthis feat in most instances prudently practicable  But thiscritical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatalcasualtiesFurthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrownoverboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharpedged terrorskittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling thelines or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in alldirections  Nor in general is it possible to secure it again untilthe whale is fairly captured and a corpseConsider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engagingone unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to thesequalities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents ofsuch an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may besimultaneously dangling about him  For of course each boat issupplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should thefirst one be ineffectually darted without recovery  All theseparticulars are faithfully narrated here as they will not fail toelucidate several most important however intricate passages inscenes hereafter to be paintedCHAPTER 64Stubbs SupperStubbs whale had been killed some distance from the ship  It was acalm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slowbusiness of towing the trophy to the Pequod  And now as we eighteenmen with our thirtysix arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs andfingers slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggishcorpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except atlong intervals good evidence was hereby furnished of theenormousness of the mass we moved  For upon the great canal ofHangHo or whatever they call it in China four or five laborers onthe footpath will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a milean hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along as ifladen with piglead in bulkDarkness came on but three lights up and down in the Pequodsmainrigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw Ahabdropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks  Vacantlyeyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders forsecuring it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seamanwent his way into the cabin and did not come forward again untilmorningThough in overseeing the pursuit of this whale Captain Ahab hadevinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that thecreature was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience ordespair seemed working in him as if the sight of that dead bodyreminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain and though athousand other whales were brought to his ship all that would notone jot advance his grand monomaniac object  Very soon you wouldhave thought from the sound on the Pequods decks that all handswere preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are beingdragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the portholesBut by those clanking links the vast corpse itself not the ship isto be moored  Tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to thebows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vesselsand seen through the darkness of the night which obscured the sparsand rigging aloft the twoship and whale seemed yoked togetherlike colossal bullocks whereof one reclines while the other remainsstandingA little item may as well be related here  The strongest and mostreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when mooredalongside is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater densitythat part is relatively heavier than any other excepting thesidefins its flexibility even in death causes it to sink lowbeneath the surface so that with the hand you cannot get at it fromthe boat in order to put the chain round it  But this difficulty isingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a woodenfloat at its outer end and a weight in its middle while the otherend is secured to the ship  By adroit management the wooden float ismade to rise on the other side of the mass so that now havinggirdled the whale the chain is readily made to follow suit andbeing slipped along the body is at last locked fast round thesmallest part of the tail at the point of junction with its broadflukes or lobesIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could beknown on deck Stubb his second mate flushed with conquestbetrayed an unusual but still goodnatured excitement  Such anunwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck his officialsuperior quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management ofaffairs  One small helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubbwas soon made strangely manifest  Stubb was a high liver he wassomewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to hispalateA steak a steak ere I sleep  You Daggoo overboard you go andcut me one from his smallHere be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as ageneral thing and according to the great military maxim make theenemy defray the current expenses of the war at least beforerealizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you find someof these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particularpart of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb comprising the taperingextremity of the bodyAbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by twolanterns of sperm oil Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermacetisupper at the capstanhead as if that capstan were a sideboard  Norwas Stubb the only banqueter on whales flesh that night  Minglingtheir mumblings with his own mastications thousands on thousands ofsharks swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on itsfatness  The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startledby the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a fewinches of the sleepers hearts  Peering over the side you could justsee them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen blackwaters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out hugeglobular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head  Thisparticular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous  How at suchan apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out suchsymmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universal problem of allthings  The mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likenedto the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screwThough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a seafightsharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ships decks likehungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved ready tobolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though whilethe valiant butchers over the decktable are thus cannibally carvingeach others live meat with carvingknives all gilded and tasselledthe sharks also with their jewelhilted mouths are quarrelsomelycarving away under the table at the dead meat and though were youto turn the whole affair upside down it would still be pretty muchthe same thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enoughfor all parties and though sharks also are the invariable outridersof all slave ships crossing the Atlantic systematically trottingalongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere ora dead slave to be decently buried and though one or two other likeinstances might be set down touching the set terms places andoccasions when sharks do most socially congregate and mosthilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion whenyou will find them in such countless numbers and in gayer or morejovial spirits than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to awhaleship at sea  If you have never seen that sight then suspendyour decision about the propriety of devilworship and theexpediency of conciliating the devilBut as yet Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that wasgoing on so nigh him no more than the sharks heeded the smacking ofhis own epicurean lipsCook cookwheres that old Fleece he cried at length wideninghis legs still further as if

having been previouslyroused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour cameshambling along from his galley for like many old blacks there wassomething the matter with his kneepans which he did not keep wellscoured like his other pans this old Fleece as they called himcame shuffling and limping along assisting his step with his tongswhich after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened iron hoopsthis old Ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word ofcommand came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubbssideboard when with both hands folded before him and resting onhis twolegged cane he bowed his arched back still further over atthe same time sideways inclining his head so as to bring his bestear into playCook said Stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to hismouth dont you think this steak is rather overdone  Youve beenbeating this steak too much cook its too tender  Dont I alwayssay that to be good a whalesteak must be tough  There are thosesharks now

old Fleece limped across thedeck to the bulwarks and then with one hand dropping his light lowover the sea so as to get a good view of his congregation with theother hand he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning far over theside in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while Stubbsoftly crawling behind overheard all that was saidFellowcritters Ise ordered here to say dat you must stop

said Stubb resuming his supper at the capstan standjust where you stood before there over against me and payparticular attentionAll dention said Fleece again stooping over upon his tongs inthe desired positionWell said Stubb helping himself freely meanwhile I shall now goback to the subject of this steak  In the first place how old areyou cookWhat dat do wid de teak said the old black testilySilence  How old are you cookBout ninety dey say he gloomily mutteredAnd you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cookand dont know yet how to cook a whalesteak rapidly

holy church in CapeTownwhere you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers ashis beloved fellowcreatures have you cook  And yet you come hereand tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now eh said StubbWhere do you expect to go to cookGo to bed berry soon he mumbled halfturning as he spokeAvast heave to  I mean when you die cook  Its an awfulquestion  Now whats your answerWhen

Massa Shark hisself muttered the oldman limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to hishammockCHAPTER 65The Whale as a DishThat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lampand like Stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seemsso outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into thehistory and philosophy of itIt is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the RightWhale was esteemed a great delicacy in France and commanded largeprices there  Also that in Henry VIIIths time a certain cook ofthe court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauceto be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are aspecies of whale  Porpoises indeed are to this day considered fineeating  The meat is made into balls about the size of billiardballs and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken forturtleballs or veal balls  The old monks of Dunfermline were veryfond of them  They had a great porpoise grant from the crownThe fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by allhands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him butwhen you come to sit down before a meatpie nearly one hundred feetlong it takes away your appetite  Only the most unprejudiced of menlike Stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the Esquimaux arenot so fastidious  We all know how they live upon whales and haverare old vintages of prime old train oil  Zogranda one of theirmost famous doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants asbeing exceedingly juicy and nourishing  And this reminds me thatcertain Englishmen who long ago were accidentally left in Greenlandby a whaling vesselthat these men actually lived for several monthson the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore aftertrying out the blubber  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps arecalled fritters which indeed they greatly resemble being brownand crisp and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewivesdoughnuts or olycooks when fresh  They have such an eatable lookthat the most selfdenying stranger can hardly keep his hands offBut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is hisexceeding richness  He is the great prize ox of the sea too fat tobe delicately good  Look at his hump which would be as fine eatingas the buffalos which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such asolid pyramid of fat  But the spermaceti itself how bland andcreamy that is like the transparent halfjellied white meat of acocoanut in the third month of its growth yet far too rich to supplya substitute for butter  Nevertheless many whalemen have a methodof absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of itIn the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for theseamen to dip their shipbiscuit into the huge oilpots and let themfry there awhile  Many a good supper have I thus madeIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a finedish  The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and thetwo plump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling twolarge puddings they are then mixed with flour and cooked into amost delectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calves headwhich is quite a dish among some epicures and every one knows thatsome young bucks among the epicures by continually dining uponcalves brains by and by get to have a little brains of their ownso as to be able to tell a calfs head from their own heads whichindeed requires uncommon discrimination  And that is the reason whya young buck with an intelligent looking calfs head before him issomehow one of the saddest sights you can see  The head looks a sortof reproachfully at him with an Et tu Brute expressionIt is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessivelyunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him withabhorrence that appears to result in some way from theconsideration before mentioned ie that a man should eat a newlymurdered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light  But nodoubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as amurderer perhaps he was hung and if he had been put on his trial byoxen he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it ifany murderer does  Go to the meatmarket of a Saturday night and seethe crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of deadquadrupeds  Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibalsjaw  Cannibals who is not a cannibal  I tell you it will be moretolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in hiscellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for thatprovident Fejee I say in the day of judgment than for theecivilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest geese to the groundand feastest on their bloated livers in thy patedefoiegrasBut Stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that isadding insult to injury is it  Look at your knifehandle there mycivilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef whatis that handle made ofwhat but the bones of the brother of thevery ox you are eating  And what do you pick your teeth with afterdevouring that fat goose  With a feather of the same fowl  And withwhat quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression ofCruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars  It is only withinthe last month or two that that society passed a resolution topatronise nothing but steel pensCHAPTER 66The Shark MassacreWhen in the Southern Fishery a captured Sperm Whale after long andweary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as ageneral thing at least customary to proceed at once to the businessof cutting him in  For that business is an exceedingly laboriousone is not very soon completed and requires all hands to set aboutit  Therefore the common usage is to take in all sail lash thehelm alee and then send every one below to his hammock tilldaylight with the reservation that until that time anchorwatchesshall be kept that is two and two for an hour each couple thecrew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes wellBut sometimes especially upon the Line in the Pacific this planwill not answer at all because such incalculable hosts of sharksgather round the moored carcase that were he left so for six hourssay on a stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible bymorning  In most other parts of the ocean however where these fishdo not so largely abound their wondrous voracity can be at timesconsiderably diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharpwhalingspades a procedure notwithstanding which in someinstances only seems to tickle them into still greater activityBut it was not thus in the present case with the Pequods sharksthough to be sure any man unaccustomed to such sights to havelooked over her side that night would have almost thought the wholeround sea was one huge cheese and those sharks the maggots in itNevertheless upon Stubb setting the anchorwatch after his supperwas concluded and when accordingly Queequeg and a forecastleseaman came on deck no small excitement was created among thesharks for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the sideand lowering three lanterns so that they cast long gleams of lightover the turbid sea these two mariners darting their longwhalingspades kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks bystriking the keen steel deep into their skulls seemingly their onlyvital part  But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and strugglinghosts the marksmen could not always hit their mark and this broughtabout new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe  Theyviciously snapped not only at each others disembowelments but likeflexible bows bent round and bit their own till those entrailsseemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth to beoppositely voided by the gaping wound  Nor was this all  It wasunsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures  Asort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their veryjoints and bones after what might be called the individual life haddeparted  Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin oneof these sharks almost took poor Queequegs hand off when he triedto shut down the dead lid of his murderous jawThe whalingspade used for cuttingin is made of the very beststeel is about the bigness of a mans spread hand and in generalshape corresponds to the garden implement after which it is namedonly its sides are perfectly flat and its upper end considerablynarrower than the lower  This weapon is always kept as sharp aspossible and when being used is occasionally honed just like arazor  In its socket a stiff pole from twenty to thirty feet longis inserted for a handleQueequeg no care what god made him shark said the savageagonizingly lifting his hand up and down wedder Fejee god orNantucket god but de god wat made shark must be one dam InginCHAPTER 67Cutting InIt was a Saturday night and such a Sabbath as followed  Ex officioprofessors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen  The ivory Pequodwas turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher  Youwould have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to thesea godsIn the first place the enormous cutting tackles among otherponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally paintedgreen and which no single man can possibly liftthis vast bunch ofgrapes was swayed up to the maintop and firmly lashed to the lowermasthead the strongest point anywhere above a ships deck  The endof the hawserlike rope winding through these intricacies was thenconducted to the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackleswas swung over the whale to this block the great blubber hookweighing some one hundred pounds was attached  And now suspended instages over the side Starbuck and Stubb the mates armed with theirlong spades began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion ofthe hook just above the nearest of the two sidefins  This done abroad semicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is insertedand the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commenceheaving in one dense crowd at the windlass  When instantly theentire ship careens over on her side every bolt in her starts likethe nailheads of an old house in frosty weather she tremblesquivers and nods her frighted mastheads to the sky  More and moreshe leans over to the whale while every gasping heave of thewindlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till atlast a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the shiprolls upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tacklerises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end ofthe first strip of blubber  Now as the blubber envelopes the whaleprecisely as the rind does an orange so is it stripped off from thebody precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing itFor the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keepsthe whale rolling over and over in the water and as the blubber inone strip uniformly peels off along the line called the scarfsimultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb the matesand just as fast as it is thus peeled off and indeed by that veryact itself it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher alofttill its upper end grazes the maintop the men at the windlass thencease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious blooddrippingmass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky and every onepresent must take good heed to dodge it when it swings else it maybox his ears and pitch him headlong overboardOne of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keenweapon called a boardingsword and watching his chance hedexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of theswaying mass  Into this hole the end of the second alternatinggreat tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubberin order to prepare for what follows  Whereupon this accomplishedswordsman warning all hands to stand off once more makes ascientific dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperatelunging slicings severs it completely in twain so that while theshort lower part is still fast the long upper strip called ablanketpiece swings clear and is all ready for lowering  Theheavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle ispeeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other isslowly slackened away and down goes the first strip through the mainhatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called theblubberroom  Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keepcoiling away the long blanketpiece as if it were a great live massof plaited serpents  And thus the work proceeds the two tackleshoisting and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlassheaving the heavers singing the blubberroom gentlemen coiling themates scarfing the ship straining and all hands swearingoccasionally by way of assuaging the general frictionCHAPTER 68The BlanketI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skinof the whale  I have had controversies about it with experiencedwhalemen afloat and learned naturalists ashore  My original opinionremains unchanged but it is only an opinionThe question is what and where is the skin of the whale  Alreadyyou know what his blubber is  That blubber is something of theconsistence of firm closegrained beef but tougher more elasticand compact and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteeninches in thicknessNow however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of anycreatures skin as being of that sort of consistence and thicknessyet in point of fact these are no arguments against such apresumption because you cannot raise any other dense envelopinglayer from the whales body but that same blubber and the outermostenveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that bebut the skin  True from the unmarred dead body of the whale youmay scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin transparentsubstance somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass onlyit is almost as flexible and soft as satin that is previous tobeing dried when it not only contracts and thickens but becomesrather hard and brittle  I have several such dried bits which I usefor marks in my whalebooks  It is transparent as I said beforeand being laid upon the printed page I have sometimes pleased myselfwith fancying it exerted a magnifying influence  At any rate it ispleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles as youmay say  But what I am driving at here is this  That sameinfinitely thin isinglass substance which I admit invests theentire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded as the skinof the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for it weresimply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendouswhale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a newborn childBut no more of thisAssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when thisskin as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale will yield the bulkof one hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that inquantity or rather weight that oil in its expressed state is onlythree fourths and not the entire substance of the coat some ideamay hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass a merepart of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as thatReckoning ten barrels to the ton you have ten tons for the netweight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whales skinIn life the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the leastamong the many marvels he presents  Almost invariably it is all overobliquely crossed and recrossed with numberless straight marks inthick array something like those in the finest Italian lineengravings  But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon theisinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through itas if they were engraved upon the body itself  Nor is this all  Insome instances to the quick observant eye those linear marks asin a veritable engraving but afford the ground for far otherdelineations  These are hieroglyphical that is if you call thosemysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics then thatis the proper word to use in the present connexion  By my retentivememory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular I wasmuch struck with a plate representing the old Indian characterschiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of theUpper Mississippi  Like those mystic rocks too the mysticmarkedwhale remains undecipherable  This allusion to the Indian rocksreminds me of another thing  Besides all the other phenomena whichthe exterior of the Sperm Whale presents he not seldom displays theback and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of theregular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratchesaltogether of an irregular random aspect  I should say that thoseNew England rocks on the seacoast which Agassiz imagines to bearthe marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergsIshould say that those rocks must not a little resemble the SpermWhale in this particular  It also seems to me that such scratches inthe whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales forI have most remarked them in the large fullgrown bulls of thespeciesA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber ofthe whale  It has already been said that it is stript from him inlong pieces called blanketpieces  Like most seaterms this one isvery happy and significant  For the whale is indeed wrapt up in hisblubber as in a real blanket or counterpane or still better anIndian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity  It isby reason of this cosy blanketing of his body that the whale isenabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers in all seastimes and tides  What would become of a Greenland whale say inthose shuddering icy seas of the North if unsupplied with his cosysurtout  True other fish are found exceedingly brisk in thoseHyperborean waters but these be it observed are your coldbloodedlungless fish whose very bellies are refrigerators creatures thatwarm themselves under the lee of an iceberg as a traveller in winterwould bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale has lungsand warm blood  Freeze his blood and he dies  How wonderful is itthenexcept after explanationthat this great monster to whomcorporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man how wonderfulthat he should be found at home immersed to his lips for life inthose Arctic waters where when seamen fall overboard they aresometimes found months afterwards perpendicularly frozen into thehearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued in amber  But moresurprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment that theblood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro insummerIt does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strongindividual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rarevirtue of interior spaciousness  Oh man admire and model thyselfafter the whale  Do thou too remain warm among ice  Do thou toolive in this world without being of it  Be cool at the equator keepthy blood fluid at the Pole  Like the great dome of St Peters andlike the great whale retain O man in all seasons a temperature ofthine ownBut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things  Oferections how few are domed like St Peters of creatures how fewvast as the whaleCHAPTER 69The FuneralHaul in the chains  Let the carcase go asternThe vast tackles have now done their duty  The peeled white body ofthe beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre though changed inhue it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk  It is stillcolossal  Slowly it floats more and more away the water round ittorn and splashed by the insatiate sharks and the air above vexedwith rapacious flights of screaming fowls whose beaks are like somany insulting poniards in the whale  The vast white headlessphantom floats further and further from the ship and every rod thatit so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods offowls augment the murderous din  For hours and hours from thealmost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen  Beneath theunclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair face of the pleasant seawafted by the joyous breezes that great mass of death floats on andon till lost in infinite perspectivesTheres a most doleful and most mocking funeral  The seavulturesall in pious mourning the airsharks all punctiliously in black orspeckled  In life but few of them would have helped the whale Iween if peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of hisfuneral they most piously do pounce  Oh horrible vultureism ofearth from which not the mightiest whale is freeNor is this the end  Desecrated as the body is a vengeful ghostsurvives and hovers over it to scare  Espied by some timidmanofwar or blundering discoveryvessel from afar when thedistance obscuring the swarming fowls nevertheless still shows thewhite mass floating in the sun and the white spray

believein themCHAPTER 70The SphynxIt should not have been omitted that previous to completely strippingthe body of the leviathan he was beheaded  Now the beheading ofthe Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon whichexperienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and notwithout reasonConsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called aneck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join therein that very place is the thickest part of him  Remember alsothat the surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten feetintervening between him and his subject and that subject almosthidden in a discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous andbursting sea  Bear in mind too that under these untowardcircumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh and in thatsubterraneous manner without so much as getting one single peep intothe evercontracting gash thus made he must skilfully steer clearof all adjacent interdicted parts and exactly divide the spine at acritical point hard by its insertion into the skull  Do you notmarvel then at Stubbs boast that he demanded but ten minutes tobehead a sperm whaleWhen first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by acable till the body is stripped  That done if it belong to a smallwhale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of  Butwith a full grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whaleshead embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely tosuspend such a burden as that even by the immense tackles of awhaler this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barnin jewellers scalesThe Pequods whale being decapitated and the body stripped the headwas hoisted against the ships sideabout half way out of the seaso that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its nativeelement  And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to itby reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower masthead andevery yardarm on that side projecting like a crane over the wavesthere that blooddripping head hung to the Pequods waist like thegiant Holoferness from the girdle of JudithWhen this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen wentbelow to their dinner  Silence reigned over the before tumultuousbut now deserted deck  An intense copper calm like a universalyellow lotus was more and more unfolding its noiseless measurelessleaves upon the seaA short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alonefrom his cabin  Taking a few turns on the quarterdeck he paused togaze over the side then slowly getting into the mainchains he tookStubbs long spadestill remaining there after the whalesDecapitationand striking it into the lower part of thehalfsuspended mass placed its other end crutchwise under one armand so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this headIt was a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of sointense a calm it seemed the Sphynxs in the desert  Speak thouvast and venerable head muttered Ahab which though ungarnishedwith a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses speakmighty head and tell us the secret thing that is in thee  Of alldivers thou hast dived the deepest  That head upon which the uppersun now gleams has moved amid this worlds foundations  Whereunrecorded names and navies rust and untold hopes and anchors rotwhere in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted withbones of millions of the drowned there in that awful waterlandthere was thy most familiar home  Thou hast been where bell or divernever went hast

exulting wave true to each other when heavenseemed false to them  Thou sawst the murdered mate when tossed bypirates from the midnight deck for hours he fell into the deepermidnight of the insatiate maw and his murderers still sailed onunharmedwhile swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship thatwould have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing armsO head thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make aninfidel of Abraham and not one syllable is thineSail ho cried a triumphant voice from the mainmastheadAye  Well now thats cheering cried Ahab suddenly erectinghimself while whole thunderclouds swept aside from his brow  Thatlively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a bettermanWhere awayThree points on the starboard bow sir and bringing down her breezeto usBetter and better man  Would now St Paul would come along thatway and to my breezelessness bring his breeze  O Nature and O soulof man how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies notthe smallest atom stirs or lives on matter but has its cunningduplicate in mindCHAPTER 71The Jeroboams StoryHand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came fasterthan the ship and soon the Pequod began to rockBy and by through the glass the strangers boats and mannedmastheads proved her a whaleship  But as she was so far towindward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some otherground the Pequod could not hope to reach her  So the signal wasset to see what response would be madeHere be it said that like the vessels of military marines the shipsof the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal all whichsignals being collected in a book with the names of the respectivevessels attached every captain is provided with it  Thereby thewhale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the oceaneven at considerable distances and with no small facilityThe Pequods signal was at last responded to by the strangerssetting her own which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam ofNantucket  Squaring her yards she bore down ranged abeam under thePequods lee and lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as thesideladder was being rigged by Starbucks order to accommodate thevisiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from hisboats stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessaryIt turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on boardand that Mayhew her captain was fearful of infecting the Pequodscompany  For though himself and boats crew remained untainted andthough his ship was half a rifleshot off and an incorruptible seaand air rolling and flowing between yet conscientiously adhering tothe timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to comeinto direct contact with the PequodBut this did by no means prevent all communications  Preserving aninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship theJeroboams boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keepparallel to the Pequod as she heavily forged through the sea for bythis time it blew very fresh with her maintopsail aback thoughindeed at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave theboat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skilfullybrought to her proper bearings again  Subject to this and other thelike interruptions now and then a conversation was sustained betweenthe two parties but at intervals not without still anotherinterruption of a very different sortPulling an oar in the Jeroboams boat was a man of a singularappearance even in that wild whaling life where individualnotabilities make up all totalities  He was a small short youngishman sprinkled all over his face with freckles and wearing redundantyellow hair  A longskirted cabalisticallycut coat of a fadedwalnut tinge enveloped him the overlapping sleeves of which wererolled up on his wrists  A deep settled fanatic delirium was inhis eyesSo soon as this figure had been first descried Stubb hadexclaimedThats he thats hethe longtogged scaramouch theTownHos company told us of  Stubb here alluded to a strange storytold of the Jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some timeprevious when the Pequod spoke the TownHo  According to thisaccount and what was subsequently learned it seemed that thescaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almosteverybody in the Jeroboam  His story was thisHe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of NeskyeunaShakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secretmeetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of atrapdoor announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial whichhe carried in his vestpocket but which instead of containinggunpowder was supposed to be charged with laudanum  A strangeapostolic whim having seized him he had left Neskyeuna forNantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumeda steady commonsense exterior and offered himself as a greenhandcandidate for the Jeroboams whaling voyage  They engaged him butstraightway upon the ships getting out of sight of land hisinsanity broke out in a freshet  He announced himself as thearchangel Gabriel and commanded the captain to jump overboard  Hepublished his manifesto whereby he set himself forth as thedeliverer of the isles of the sea and vicargeneral of all OceanicaThe unflinching earnestness with which he declared these thingsthedark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and all thepreternatural terrors of real delirium united to invest this Gabrielin the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphereof sacredness  Moreover they were afraid of him  As such a manhowever was not of much practical use in the ship especially as herefused to work except when he pleased the incredulous captain wouldfain have been rid of him but apprised that that individualsintention was to land him in the first convenient port the archangelforthwith opened all his seals and vialsdevoting the ship and allhands to unconditional perdition in case this intention was carriedout  So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew thatat last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabrielwas sent from the ship not a man of them would remain  He wastherefore forced to relinquish his plan  Nor would they permitGabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that itcame to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship  Theconsequence of all this was that the archangel cared little ornothing for the captain and mates and since the epidemic had brokenout he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that the plagueas he called it was at his sole command nor should it be stayed butaccording to his good pleasure  The sailors mostly poor devilscringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience to hisinstructions sometimes rendering him personal homage as to a godSuch things may seem incredible but however wondrous they aretrue  Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect tothe measureless selfdeception of the fanatic himself as hismeasureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others  Butit is time to return to the PequodI fear not thy epidemic man said Ahab from the bulwarks toCaptain Mayhew who stood in the boats stern come on boardBut now Gabriel started to his feetThink think of the fevers yellow and bilious  Beware of thehorrible plagueGabriel  Gabriel cried Captain Mayhew thou must either  Butthat instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and itsseethings drowned all speechHast thou seen the White Whale demanded Ahab when the boatdrifted backThink think of thy whaleboat stoven and sunk  Beware of thehorrible tailI tell thee again Gabriel that  But again the boat tore aheadas if dragged by fiends  Nothing was said for some moments while asuccession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of thoseoccasional caprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving itMeantime the hoisted sperm whales head jogged about very violentlyand Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness thanhis archangel nature seemed to warrantWhen this interlude was over Captain Mayhew began a dark storyconcerning Moby Dick not however without frequent interruptionsfrom Gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea thatseemed leagued with himIt seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home when uponspeaking a whaleship her people were reliably apprised of theexistence of Moby Dick and the havoc he had made  Greedily suckingin this intelligence Gabriel solemnly warned the captain againstattacking the White Whale in case the monster should be seen in hisgibbering insanity pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a beingthan the Shaker God incarnated the Shakers receiving the Bible  Butwhen some year or two afterwards Moby Dick was fairly sighted fromthe mastheads Macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounterhim and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have theopportunity despite all the archangels denunciations andforewarnings Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boatWith them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and manyperilous unsuccessful onsets he at last succeeded in getting oneiron fast  Meantime Gabriel ascending to the mainroyal mastheadwas tossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth propheciesof speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity  Nowwhile Macey the mate was standing up in his boats bow and withall the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wildexclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance forhis poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by itsquick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of thebodies of the oarsmen  Next instant the luckless mate so full offurious life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arcin his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fiftyyards  Not a chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of anyoarsmans head but the mate for ever sankIt is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in theSpermWhale Fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as anySometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilatedoftener the boats bow is knocked off or the thighboard in whichthe headsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the bodyBut strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instancesthan one when the body has been recovered not a single mark ofviolence is discernible the man being stark deadThe whole calamity with the falling form of Macey was plainlydescried from the ship  Raising a piercing shriekThe vial thevial  Gabriel called off the terrorstricken crew from the furtherhunting of the whale  This terrible event clothed the archangel withadded influence because his credulous disciples believed that he hadspecifically foreannounced it instead of only making a generalprophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hitone of many marks in the wide margin allowed  He became a namelessterror to the shipMayhew having concluded his narration Ahab put such questions tohim that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether heintended to hunt the White Whale if opportunity should offer  Towhich Ahab answeredAye  Straightway then Gabriel once morestarted to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehementlyexclaimed with downward pointed fingerThink think of theblasphemerdead and down therebeware of the blasphemers endAhab stolidly turned aside then said to Mayhew Captain I havejust bethought me of my letterbag there is a letter for one of thyofficers if I mistake not  Starbuck look over the bagEvery whaleship takes out a goodly number of letters for variousships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addresseddepends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceansThus most letters never reach their mark and many are onlyreceived after attaining an age of two or three years or moreSoon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand  It was sorelytumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould inconsequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin  Of such aletter Death himself might well have been the postboyCanst not read it cried Ahab  Give it me man  Aye aye itsbut a dim scrawlwhats this  As he was studying it out Starbucktook a long cuttingspade pole and with his knife slightly split theend to insert the letter there and in that way hand it to theboat without its coming any closer to the shipMeantime Ahab holding the letter muttered Mr Haryes MrHarrya womans pinny handthe mans wife Ill wagerAyeMrHarry Macey Ship Jeroboamwhy its Macey and hes deadPoor fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed Mayhew butlet me have itNay keep it thyself cried Gabriel to Ahab thou art soon goingthat wayCurses throttle thee yelled Ahab  Captain Mayhew stand by nowto receive it and taking the fatal missive from Starbucks handshe caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards theboat  But as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted fromrowing the boat drifted a little towards the ships stern so thatas if by magic the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriels eagerhand  He clutched it in an instant seized the boatknife andimpaling the letter on it sent it thus loaded back into the shipIt fell at Ahabs feet  Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades togive way with their oars and in that manner the mutinous boatrapidly shot away from the PequodAs after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon thejacket of the whale many strange things were hinted in reference tothis wild affairCHAPTER 72The MonkeyRopeIn the tumultuous business of cuttingin and attending to a whalethere is much running backwards and forwards among the crew  Nowhands are wanted here and then again hands are wanted there  Thereis no staying in any one place for at one and the same timeeverything has to be done everywhere  It is much the same with himwho endeavors the description of the scene  We must now retrace ourway a little  It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground inthe whales back the blubberhook was inserted into the originalhole there cut by the spades of the mates  But how did so clumsy andweighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole  It wasinserted there by my particular friend Queequeg whose duty it wasas harpooneer to descend upon the monsters back for the specialpurpose referred to  But in very many cases circumstances requirethat the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensingor stripping operation is concluded  The whale be it observed liesalmost entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operatedupon  So down there some ten feet below the level of the deck thepoor harpooneer flounders about half on the whale and half in thewater as the vast mass revolves like a treadmill beneath him  Onthe occasion in question Queequeg figured in the Highland costumeashirt and socksin which to my eyes at least he appeared touncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him aswill presently be seenBeing the savages bowsman that is the person who pulled thebowoar in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerfulduty to attend upon him while taking that hardscrabble scramble uponthe dead whales back  You have seen Italian organboys holding adancingape by a long cord  Just so from the ships steep side didI hold Queequeg down there in the sea by what is technically calledin the fishery a monkeyrope attached to a strong strip of canvasbelted round his waistIt was a humorously perilous business for both of us  For before weproceed further it must be said that the monkeyrope was fast atboth ends fast to Queequegs broad canvas belt and fast to mynarrow leather one  So that for better or for worse we two for thetime were wedded and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no morethen both usage and honour demanded that instead of cutting the cordit should drag me down in his wake  So then an elongated Siameseligature united us  Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brothernor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which thehempen bond entailedSo strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation thenthat while earnestly watching his motions I seemed distinctly toperceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stockcompany of two that my free will had received a mortal wound andthat anothers mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me intounmerited disaster and death  Therefore I saw that here was a sortof interregnum in Providence for its evenhanded equity never couldhave so gross an injustice  And yet still further ponderingwhile Ijerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which wouldthreaten to jam himstill further pondering I say I saw that thissituation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal thatbreathes only in most cases he one way or other has this Siameseconnexion with a plurality of other mortals  If your banker breaksyou snap if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in yourpills you die  True you may say that by exceeding caution youmay possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances oflife  But handle Queequegs monkeyrope heedfully as I wouldsometimes he jerked it so that I came very near sliding overboardNor could I possibly forget that do what I would I only had themanagement of one end of itThe monkeyrope is found in all whalers but it was only in thePequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together  Thisimprovement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a manthan Stubb in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongestpossible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of hismonkeyrope holderI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between thewhale and the shipwhere he would occasionally fall from theincessant rolling and swaying of both  But this was not the onlyjamming jeopardy he was exposed to  Unappalled by the massacre madeupon them during the night the sharks now freshly and more keenlyallured by the before pent blood which began to flow from thecarcassthe rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehiveAnd right in among those sharks was Queequeg who often pushed themaside with his floundering feet  A thing altogether incredible wereit not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwisemiscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a manNevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such aravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp tothem  Accordingly besides the monkeyrope with which I now andthen jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw ofwhat seemed a peculiarly ferocious sharkhe was provided with stillanother protection  Suspended over the side in one of the stagesTashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple ofkeen whalespades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as theycould reach  This procedure of theirs to be sure was verydisinterested and benevolent of them  They meant Queequegs besthappiness I admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and fromthe circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times halfhidden by the bloodmuddled water those indiscreet spades of theirswould come nearer amputating a leg than a tall  But poor Queequeg Isuppose straining and gasping there with that great iron hookpoorQueequeg I suppose only prayed to his Yojo and gave up his lifeinto the hands of his godsWell well my dear comrade and twinbrother thought I as I drew inand then slacked off the rope to every swell of the seawhat mattersit after all  Are you not the precious image of each and all of usmen in this whaling world  That unsounded ocean you gasp in isLife those sharks your foes those spades your friends and whatbetween sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poorladBut courage there is good cheer in store for you Queequeg  Fornow as with blue lips and bloodshot eyes the exhausted savage atlast climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarilytrembling over the side the steward advances and with a benevolentconsolatory glance hands himwhat  Some hot Cognac  No hands himye gods hands him a cup of tepid ginger and waterGinger  Do I smell ginger suspiciously asked Stubb coming nearYes this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cupThen standing as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towardsthe astonished steward slowly saying Ginger ginger and will youhave the goodness to tell me Mr DoughBoy where lies the virtue ofginger  Ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use Doughboy tokindle a fire in this shivering cannibal  Gingerwhat the devil isgingerseacoal firewoodlucifermatchestindergunpowderwhat the devil is ginger I say thatyou offer this cup to our poor Queequeg hereThere is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about thisbusiness he suddenly added now approaching Starbuck who had justcome from forward  Will you look at that kannakin sir smell ofit if you please  Then watching the mates countenance he addedThe steward Mr Starbuck had the face to offer that calomel andjalap to Queequeg there this instant off the whale  Is the stewardan apothecary sir and may I ask whether this is the sort of bittersby which he blows back the life into a halfdrowned manI trust not said Starbuck it is poor stuff enoughAye aye steward cried Stubb well teach you to drug itharpooneer none of your apothecarys medicine here you want topoison us do ye  You have got out insurances on our lives and wantto murder us all and pocket the proceeds do yeIt was not me cried DoughBoy it was Aunt Charity that broughtthe ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneers anyspirits but only this gingerjubso she called itGingerjub you gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye tothe lockers and get something better  I hope I do no wrong MrStarbuck  It is the captains ordersgrog for the harpooneer on awhaleEnough replied Starbuck only dont hit him again butOh I never hurt when I hit except when I hit a whale or somethingof that sort and this fellows a weazel  What were you aboutsaying sirOnly this go down with him and get what thou wantest thyselfWhen Stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and asort of teacaddy in the other  The first contained strong spiritsand was handed to Queequeg the second was Aunt Charitys gift andthat was freely given to the wavesCHAPTER 73Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale and Then Have a Talk Over HimIt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whalesprodigious head hanging to the Pequods side  But we must let itcontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend toit  For the present other matters press and the best we can do nowfor the head is to pray heaven the tackles may holdNow during the past night and forenoon the Pequod had graduallydrifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow britgave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales a species of theLeviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurkinganywhere near  And though all hands commonly disdained the captureof those inferior creatures and though the Pequod was notcommissioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passednumbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat yet nowthat a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to thesurprise of all the announcement was made that a Right Whale shouldbe captured that day if opportunity offeredNor was this long wanting  Tall spouts were seen to leeward and twoboats Stubbs and Flasks were detached in pursuit  Pullingfurther and further away they at last became almost invisible to themen at the masthead  But suddenly in the distance they saw a greatheap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloftthat one or both the boats must be fast  An interval passed and theboats were in plain sight in the act of being dragged right towardsthe ship by the towing whale  So close did the monster come to thehull that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenlygoing down in a maelstrom within three rods of the planks he whollydisappeared from view as if diving under the keel  Cut cut wasthe cry from the ship to the boats which for one instant seemed onthe point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vesselsside  But having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale notsounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at thesame time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the shipFor a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical for whilethey still slacked out the tightened line in one direction and stillplied their oars in another the contending strain threatened to takethem under  But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gainAnd they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swifttremor was felt running like lightning along the keel as thestrained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view underher bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its drippingsthat the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water while thewhale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boats were free tofly  But the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering hiscourse went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats afterhim so that they performed a complete circuitMeantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till closeflanking him on both sides Stubb answered Flask with lance forlance and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went while themultitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whalesbody rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinkingat every new gash as the eager Israelites did at the new burstingfountains that poured from the smitten rockAt last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit heturned upon his back a corpseWhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to hisflukes and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towingsome conversation ensued between themI wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard saidStubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do withso ignoble a leviathanWants with it said Flask coiling some spare line in the boatsbow did you never hear that the ship which but once has a SpermWhales head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time aRight Whales on the larboard did you never hear Stubb that thatship can never afterwards capsizeWhy notI dont know but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah sayingso and he seems to know all about ships charms  But I sometimesthink hell charm the ship to no good at last  I dont half likethat chap Stubb  Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sortof carved into a snakes head StubbSink him  I never look at him at all but if ever I get a chance ofa dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one bylook down there Flaskpointing into the sea with a peculiar motionof both handsAye will I  Flask I take that Fedallah to be thedevil in disguise  Do you believe that cock and bull story about hishaving been stowed away on board ship  Hes the devil I say  Thereason why you dont see his tail is because he tucks it up out ofsight he carries it coiled away in his pocket I guess  Blast himnow that I think of it hes always wanting oakum to stuff into thetoes of his bootsHe sleeps in his boots dont he  He hasnt got any hammock butIve seen him lay of nights in a coil of riggingNo doubt and its because of his cursed tail he coils it down doye see in the eye of the riggingWhats the old man have so much to do with him forStriking up a swap or a bargain I supposeBargainabout whatWhy do ye see the old man is hard bent after that White Whale andthe devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap awayhis silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and thenhell surrender Moby DickPooh  Stubb you are skylarking how can Fedallah do thatI dont know Flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wickedone I tell ye  Why they say as how he went a sauntering into theold flagship once switching his tail about devilish easy andgentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home  Wellhe was at home and asked the devil what he wanted  The devilswitching his hoofs up and says I want John  What for saysthe old governor  What business is that of yours says the devilgetting madI want to use him  Take him says thegovernorand by the Lord Flask if the devil didnt give John theAsiatic cholera before he got through with him Ill eat this whalein one mouthful  But look sharpaint you all ready there  Wellthen pull ahead and lets get the whale alongsideI think I remember some such story as you were telling said Flaskwhen at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burdentowards the ship but I cant remember whereThree Spaniards  Adventures of those three bloodyminded soladoesDid ye read it there Flask  I guess ye didNo never saw such a book heard of it though  But now tell meStubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just nowwas the same you say is now on board the PequodAm I the same man that helped kill this whale  Doesnt the devillive for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead  Did you eversee any parson a wearing mourning for the devil  And if the devilhas a latchkey to get into the admirals cabin dont you suppose hecan crawl into a porthole  Tell me that Mr FlaskHow old do you suppose Fedallah is StubbDo you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well thatsthe figure one now take all the hoops in the Pequods hold andstring along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see wellthat wouldnt begin to be Fedallahs age  Nor all the coopers increation couldnt show hoops enough to make oughts enoughBut see here Stubb I thought you a little boasted just now thatyou meant to give Fedallah a seatoss if you got a good chanceNow if hes so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he isgoing to live for ever what good will it do to pitch himoverboardtell me thatGive him a good ducking anyhowBut hed crawl backDuck him again and keep ducking himSuppose he should take it into his head to duck you thoughyesand drown youwhat thenI should like to see him try it Id give him such a pair of blackeyes that he wouldnt dare to show his face in the admirals cabinagain for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where helives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so muchDamn the devil Flask so you suppose Im afraid of the devil  Whosafraid of him except the old governor who daresnt catch him and puthim in doubledarbies as he deserves but lets him go aboutkidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all thepeople the devil kidnapped hed roast for him  Theres a governorDo you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain AhabDo I suppose it  Youll know it before long Flask  But I am goingnow to keep a sharp lookout on him and if I see anything verysuspicious going on Ill just take him by the nape of his neck andsayLook here Beelzebub you dont do it and if he makes any fussby the Lord Ill make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it tothe capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tailwill come short off at the stumpdo you see and then I ratherguess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion hell sneakoff without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between hislegsAnd what will you do with the tail StubbDo with it  Sell it for an ox whip when we get homewhat elseNow do you mean what you say and have been saying all alongStubbMean or not mean here we are at the shipThe boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the larboard sidewhere fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared forsecuring himDidnt I tell you so said Flask yes youll soon see this rightwhales head hoisted up opposite that parmacettisIn good time Flasks saying proved true  As before the Pequodsteeply leaned over towards the sperm whales head now by thecounterpoise of both heads she regained her even keel though sorelystrained you may well believe  So when on one side you hoist inLockes head you go over that way but now on the other side hoistin Kants and you come back again but in very poor plight  Thussome minds for ever keep trimming boat  Oh ye foolish throw allthese thunderheads overboard and then you will float light andrightIn disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside theship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in thecase of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cutoff whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separatelyremoved and hoisted on deck with all the well known black boneattached to what is called the crownpiece  But nothing like thisin the present case had been done  The carcases of both whales haddropped astern and the headladen ship not a little resembled a mulecarrying a pair of overburdening panniersMeantime Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whales head and everand anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in hisown hand  And Ahab chanced so to stand that the Parsee occupied hisshadow while if the Parsees shadow was there at all it seemed onlyto blend with and lengthen Ahabs  As the crew toiled onLaplandish speculations were bandied among them concerning all thesepassing thingsCHAPTER 74The Sperm Whales HeadContrasted ViewHere now are two great whales laying their heads together let usjoin them and lay together our ownOf the grand order of folio leviathans the Sperm Whale and the RightWhale are by far the most noteworthy  They are the only whalesregularly hunted by man  To the Nantucketer they present the twoextremes of all the known varieties of the whale  As the externaldifference between them is mainly observable in their heads and as ahead of each is this moment hanging from the Pequods side and as wemay freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across thedeckwhere I should like to know will you obtain a better chanceto study practical cetology than hereIn the first place you are struck by the general contrast betweenthese heads  Both are massive enough in all conscience but thereis a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whales which theRight Whales sadly lacks  There is more character in the SpermWhales head  As you behold it you involuntarily yield the immensesuperiority to him in point of pervading dignity  In the presentinstance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and saltcolour of his head at the summit giving token of advanced age andlarge experience  In short he is what the fishermen technicallycall a greyheaded whaleLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these headsnamely thetwo most important organs the eye and the ear  Far back on the sideof the head and low down near the angle of either whales jaw ifyou narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which youwould fancy to be a young colts eye so out of all proportion is itto the magnitude of the headNow from this peculiar sideway position of the whales eyes it isplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no morethan he can one exactly astern  In a word the position of thewhales eyes corresponds to that of a mans ears and you may fancyfor yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways surveyobjects through your ears  You would find that you could onlycommand some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straightsideline of sight and about thirty more behind it  If yourbitterest foe were walking straight towards you with dagger upliftedin broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if hewere stealing upon you from behind  In a word you would have twobacks so to speak but at the same time also two fronts sidefronts for what is it that makes the front of a manwhat indeedbut his eyesMoreover while in most other animals that I can now think of theeyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power soas to produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiarposition of the whales eyes effectually divided as they are by manycubic feet of solid head which towers between them like a greatmountain separating two lakes in valleys this of course mustwholly separate the impressions which each independent organ impartsThe whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this sideand another distinct picture on that side while all between must beprofound darkness and nothingness to him  Man may in effect besaid to look out on the world from a sentrybox with two joinedsashes for his window  But with the whale these two sashes areseparately inserted making two distinct windows but sadly impairingthe view  This peculiarity of the whales eyes is a thing always tobe borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the readerin some subsequent scenesA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning thisvisual matter as touching the Leviathan  But I must be content witha hint  So long as a mans eyes are open in the light the act ofseeing is involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanicallyseeing whatever objects are before him  Nevertheless any onesexperience will teach him that though he can take in anundiscriminating sweep of things at one glance it is quiteimpossible for him attentively and completely to examine any twothingshowever large or however smallat one and the same instantof time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each otherBut if you now come to separate these two objects and surround eachby a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of themin such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it the other willbe utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness  How is itthen with the whale  True both his eyes in themselves mustsimultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensivecombining and subtle than mans that he can at the same moment oftime attentively examine two distinct prospects one on one side ofhim and the other in an exactly opposite direction  If he can thenis it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were ablesimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinctproblems in Euclid  Nor strictly investigated is there anyincongruity in this comparisonIt may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that theextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales whenbeset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queerfrights so common to such whales I think that all this indirectlyproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which theirdivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involvethemBut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye  If you arean entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two headsfor hours and never discover that organ  The ear has no externalleaf whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert aquill so wondrously minute is it  It is lodged a little behind theeye  With respect to their ears this important difference is to beobserved between the sperm whale and the right  While the ear ofthe former has an external opening that of the latter is entirelyand evenly covered over with a membrane so as to be quiteimperceptible from withoutIs it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see theworld through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an earwhich is smaller than a hares  But if his eyes were broad as thelens of Herschels great telescope and his ears capacious as theporches of cathedrals would that make him any longer of sight orsharper of hearing  Not at allWhy then do you try to enlargeyour mind  Subtilize itLet us now with whatever levers and steamengines we have at handcant over the sperm whales head that it may lie bottom upthen ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down themouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated fromit with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky MammothCave of his stomach  But let us hold on here by this tooth and lookabout us where we are  What a really beautiful and chastelookingmouth from floor to ceiling lined or rather papered with aglistening white membrane glossy as bridal satinsBut come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seemslike the long narrow lid of an immense snuffbox with the hinge atone end instead of one side  If you pry it up so as to get itoverhead and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrificportcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in thefishery upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force  But farmore terrible is it to behold when fathoms down in the sea you seesome sulky whale floating there suspended with his prodigious jawsome fifteen feet long hanging straight down at rightangles withhis body for all the world like a ships jibboom  This whale isnot dead he is only dispirited out of sorts perhapshypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his jaw haverelaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight areproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lockjawsupon himIn most cases this lower jawbeing easily unhinged by a practisedartistis disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose ofextracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hardwhite whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curiousarticles including canes umbrellastocks and handles toridingwhipsWith a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it werean anchor and when the proper time comessome few days after theother workQueequeg Daggoo and Tashtego being all accomplisheddentists are set to drawing teeth  With a keen cuttingspadeQueequeg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringboltsand a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth asMichigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands  Thereare generally fortytwo teeth in all in old whales much worn downbut undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion  The jaw isafterwards sawn into slabs and piled away like joists for buildinghousesCHAPTER 75The Right Whales HeadContrasted ViewCrossing the deck let us now have a good long look at the RightWhales headAs in general shape the noble Sperm Whales head may be compared to aRoman warchariot especially in front where it is so broadlyrounded so at a broad view the Right Whales head bears a ratherinelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliottoed shoe  Two hundredyears ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of ashoemakers last  And in this same last or shoe that old woman ofthe nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably belodged she and all her progenyBut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assumedifferent aspects according to your point of view  If you stand onits summit and look at these two Fshaped spoutholes you would takethe whole head for an enormous bassviol and these spiracles theapertures in its soundingboard  Then again if you fix your eyeupon this strange crested comblike incrustation on the top of themassthis green barnacled thing which the Greenlanders call thecrown and the Southern fishers the bonnet of the Right Whalefixing your eyes solely on this you would take the head for thetrunk of some huge oak with a birds nest in its crotch  At anyrate when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on thisbonnet such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you unlessindeed your fancy has been fixed by the technical term crown alsobestowed upon it in which case you will take great interest inthinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of thesea whose green crown has been put together for him in thismarvellous manner  But if this whale be a king he is a very sulkylooking fellow to grace a diadem  Look at that hanging lower lipwhat a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpentersmeasurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep a sulk andpout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and moreA great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be harelippedThe fissure is about a foot across  Probably the mother during animportant interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast whenearthquakes caused the beach to gape  Over this lip as over aslippery threshold we now slide into the mouth  Upon my word were Iat Mackinaw I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwamGood Lord is this the road that Jonah went  The roof is abouttwelve feet high and runs to a pretty sharp angle as if there werea regular ridgepole there while these ribbed arched hairy sidespresent us with those wondrous half vertical scimetarshaped slatsof whalebone say three hundred on a side which depending from theupper part of the head or crown bone form those Venetian blindswhich have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned  The edges of thesebones are fringed with hairy fibres through which the Right Whalestrains the water and in whose intricacies he retains the smallfish when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feedingtime  In the central blinds of bone as they stand in their naturalorder there are certain curious marks curves hollows and ridgeswhereby some whalemen calculate the creatures age as the age of anoak by its circular rings  Though the certainty of this criterion isfar from demonstrable yet it has the savor of analogicalprobability  At any rate if we yield to it we must grant a fargreater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seemreasonableIn old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fanciesconcerning these blinds  One voyager in Purchas calls them thewondrous whiskers inside of the whales mouth another hogsbristles a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the followingelegant language There are about two hundred and fifty fins growingon each side of his upper CHOP which arch over his tongue on eachside of his mouthThis reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whiskeror rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hairs onthe upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw  Sometimes thesetufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemncountenanceAs every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskersblinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busksand other stiffening contrivances  But in this particular thedemand has long been on the decline  It was in Queen Annes timethat the bone was in its glory the farthingale being then all thefashion  And as those ancient dames moved about gaily though in thejaws of the whale as you may say even so in a shower with thelike thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaws forprotection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same boneBut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment andstanding in the Right Whales mouth look around you afresh  Seeingall these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would younot think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ and gazingupon its thousand pipes  For a carpet to the organ we have a rug ofthe softest Turkeythe tongue which is glued as it were to thefloor of the mouth  It is very fat and tender and apt to tear inpieces in hoisting it on deck  This particular tongue now before usat a passing glance I should say it was a sixbarreler that is itwill yield you about that amount of oilEre this you must have plainly seen the truth of what I startedwiththat the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirelydifferent heads  To sum up then in the Right Whales there is nogreat well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandibleof a lower jaw like the Sperm Whales  Nor in the Sperm Whale arethere any of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcelyanything of a tongue  Again the Right Whale has two externalspoutholes the Sperm Whale only oneLook your last now on these venerable hooded heads while they yetlie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in the sea theother will not be very long in followingCan you catch the expression of the Sperm Whales there  It is thesame he died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the foreheadseem now faded away  I think his broad brow to be full of aprairielike placidity born of a speculative indifference as todeath  But mark the other heads expression  See that amazing lowerlip pressed by accident against the vessels side so as firmly toembrace the jaw  Does not this whole head seem to speak of anenormous practical resolution in facing death  This Right Whale Itake to have been a Stoic the Sperm Whale a Platonian who mighthave taken up Spinoza in his latter yearsCHAPTER 76The BatteringRamEre quitting for the nonce the Sperm Whales head I would haveyou as a sensible physiologist simplyparticularly remark itsfront aspect in all its compacted collectedness  I would have youinvestigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself someunexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever batteringram powermay be lodged there  Here is a vital point for you must eithersatisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remainan infidel as to one of the most appalling but not the less trueevents perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded historyYou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the SpermWhale the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical planeto the water you observe that the lower part of that front slopesconsiderably backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for thelong socket which receives the boomlike lower jaw you observe thatthe mouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeedas though your own mouth were entirely under your chin  Moreover youobserve that the whale has no external nose and that what nose hehashis spout holeis on the top of his head you observe that hiseyes and ears are at the sides of his head nearly one third of hisentire length from the front  Wherefore you must now have perceivedthat the front of the Sperm Whales head is a dead blind wallwithout a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoeverFurthermore you are now to consider that only in the extreme lowerbackward sloping part of the front of the head is there theslightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty feet fromthe forehead do you come to the full cranial development  So thatthis whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad  Finally though aswill soon be revealed its contents partly comprise the most delicateoil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substancewhich so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy  In someprevious place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the bodyof the whale as the rind wraps an orange  Just so with the headbut with this difference about the head this envelope though not sothick is of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who has nothandled it  The severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance dartedby the strongest human arm impotently rebounds from it  It is asthough the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses hoofsI do not think that any sensation lurks in itBethink yourself also of another thing  When two large loadedIndiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in thedocks what do the sailors do  They do not suspend between them atthe point of coming contact any merely hard substance like iron orwood  No they hold there a large round wad of tow and corkenveloped in the thickest and toughest of oxhide  That bravely anduninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oakenhandspikes and iron crowbars  By itself this sufficientlyillustrates the obvious fact I drive at  But supplementary to thisit has hypothetically occurred to me that as ordinary fish possesswhat is called a swimming bladder in them capable at will ofdistension or contraction and as the Sperm Whale as far as I knowhas no such provision in him considering too the otherwiseinexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogetherbeneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevated out of thewater considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelopeconsidering the unique interior of his head it has hypotheticallyoccurred to me I say that those mystical lungcelled honeycombsthere may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspectedconnexion with the outer air so as to be susceptible to atmosphericdistension and contraction  If this be so fancy theirresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable anddestructive of all elements contributesNow mark  Unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurablewall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all amass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piledwood isby the cord and all obedient to one volition as thesmallest insect  So that when I shall hereafter detail to you allthe specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking inthis expansive monster when I shall show you some of his moreinconsiderable braining feats I trust you will have renounced allignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though theSperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien and mixedthe Atlantic with the Pacific you would not elevate one hair of youreyebrow  For unless you own the whale you are but a provincial andsentimentalist in Truth  But clear Truth is a thing for salamandergiants only to encounter how small the chances for the provincialsthen  What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddesssveil at LaisCHAPTER 77The Great Heidelburgh TunNow comes the Baling of the Case  But to comprehend it aright youmust know something of the curious internal structure of the thingoperated uponRegarding the Sperm Whales head as a solid oblong you may on aninclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof thelower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and theupper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward endforming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale  At themiddle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin andthen you have two almost equal parts which before were naturallydivided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substanceQuoin is not a Euclidean term  It belongs to the pure nauticalmathematics  I know not that it has been defined before  A quoin isa solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed bythe steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering ofboth sidesThe lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycombof oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousandinfiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibres throughout its wholeextent  The upper part known as the Case may be regarded as thegreat Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale  And as that famous greattierce is mystically carved in front so the whales vast plaitedforehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematicaladornment of his wondrous tun  Moreover as that of Heidelburgh wasalways replenished with the most excellent of the wines of theRhenish valleys so the tun of the whale contains by far the mostprecious of all his oily vintages namely the highlyprizedspermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous stateNor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part ofthe creature  Though in life it remains perfectly fluid yet uponexposure to the air after death it soon begins to concrete sendingforth beautiful crystalline shoots as when the first thin delicateice is just forming in water  A large whales case generally yieldsabout five hundred gallons of sperm though from unavoidablecircumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and dribblesaway or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business ofsecuring what you canI know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun wascoated within but in superlative richness that coating could notpossibly have compared with the silken pearlcoloured membrane likethe lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the SpermWhales caseIt will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whaleembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head andsinceas has been elsewhere set forththe head embraces one thirdof the whole length of the creature then setting that length down ateighty feet for a good sized whale you have more than twentysixfeet for the depth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up anddown against a ships sideAs in decapitating the whale the operators instrument is broughtclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into thespermaceti magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedfullest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary andwastingly let out its invaluable contents  It is this decapitatedend of the head also which is at last elevated out of the waterand retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles whosehempen combinations on one side make quite a wilderness of ropes inthat quarterThus much being said attend now I pray you to that marvellousandin this particular instancealmost fatal operation whereby theSperm Whales great Heidelburgh Tun is tappedCHAPTER 78Cistern and BucketsNimble as a cat Tashtego mounts aloft and without altering hiserect posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyardarmto the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun  He hascarried with him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only twoparts travelling through a singlesheaved block  Securing thisblock so that it hangs down from the yardarm he swings one end ofthe rope till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deckThen handoverhand down the other part the Indian drops throughthe air till dexterously he lands on the summit of the headTherestill high elevated above the rest of the company to whom hevivaciously crieshe seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the goodpeople to prayers from the top of a tower  A shorthandled sharpspade being sent up to him he diligently searches for the properplace to begin breaking into the Tun  In this business he proceedsvery heedfully like a treasurehunter in some old house soundingthe walls to find where the gold is masoned in  By the time thiscautious search is over a stout ironbound bucket precisely like awellbucket has been attached to one end of the whip while theother end being stretched across the deck is there held by two orthree alert hands  These last now hoist the bucket within grasp ofthe Indian to whom another person has reached up a very long poleInserting this pole into the bucket Tashtego downward guides thebucket into the Tun till it entirely disappears then giving theword to the seamen at the whip up comes the bucket again allbubbling like a dairymaids pail of new milk  Carefully loweredfrom its height the fullfreighted vessel is caught by an appointedhand and quickly emptied into a large tub  Then remounting aloftit again goes through the same round until the deep cistern willyield no more  Towards the end Tashtego has to ram his long poleharder and harder and deeper and deeper into the Tun until sometwenty feet of the pole have gone downNow the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this wayseveral tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all atonce a queer accident happened  Whether it was that Tashtego thatwild Indian was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a momenthis onehanded hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the heador whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy orwhether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so withoutstating his particular reasons how it was exactly there is notelling now but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth bucketcame suckingly upmy God poor Tashtegolike the twin reciprocatingbucket in a veritable well dropped headforemost down into thisgreat Tun of Heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling wentclean out of sightMan overboard cried Daggoo who amid the general consternationfirst came to his senses  Swing the bucket this way and puttingone foot into it so as the better to secure his slippery handholdon the whip itself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of thehead almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottomMeantime there was a terrible tumult  Looking over the side theysaw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below thesurface of the sea as if that moment seized with some momentousidea whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing bythose struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunkAt this instant while Daggoo on the summit of the head wasclearing the whipwhich had somehow got foul of the great cuttingtacklesa sharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakablehorror of all one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head toreout and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung tillthe drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg  The oneremaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended seemedevery instant to be on the point of giving way an event still morelikely from the violent motions of the headCome down come down yelled the seamen to Daggoo but with onehand holding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head shoulddrop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared thefoul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed wellmeaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoistedoutIn heavens name man cried Stubb are you ramming home acartridge thereAvast  How will that help him jamming thatironbound bucket on top of his head  Avast will yeStand clear of the tackle cried a voice like the bursting of arocketAlmost in the same instant with a thunderboom the enormous massdropped into the sea like Niagaras TableRock into the whirlpoolthe suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down herglittering copper and all caught their breath as half swingingnowover the sailors heads and now over the waterDaggoo through athick mist of spray was dimly beheld clinging to the penduloustackles while poor buriedalive Tashtego was sinking utterly downto the bottom of the sea  But hardly had the blinding vapour clearedaway when a naked figure with a boardingsword in his hand was forone swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks  The next a loudsplash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue  Onepacked rush was made to the side and every eye counted every rippleas moment followed moment and no sign of either the sinker or thediver could be seen  Some hands now jumped into a boat alongsideand pushed a little off from the shipHa ha cried Daggoo all at once from his now quiet swingingperch overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an armthrust upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an armthrust forth from the grass over a graveBoth bothit is bothcried Daggoo again with a joyful shoutand soon after Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one handand with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian  Drawn intothe waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but Tashtegowas long in coming to and Queequeg did not look very briskNow how had this noble rescue been accomplished  Why diving afterthe slowly descending head Queequeg with his keen sword had madeside lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole therethen dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards andupwards and so hauled out poor Tash by the head  He averred thatupon first thrusting in for him a leg was presented but wellknowing that that was not as it ought to be and might occasion greattroublehe had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave andtoss had wrought a somerset upon the Indian so that with the nexttrial he came forth in the good old wayhead foremost  As for thegreat head itself that was doing as well as could be expectedAnd thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics ofQueequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of Tashtego wassuccessfully accomplished in the teeth too of the most untowardand apparently hopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means tobe forgotten  Midwifery should be taught in the same course withfencing and boxing riding and rowingI know that this queer adventure of the GayHeaders will be sure toseem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may haveeither seen or heard of some ones falling into a cistern ashore anaccident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too thanthe Indians considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb ofthe Sperm Whales wellBut peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this  Wethought the tissued infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale was thelightest and most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sinkin an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself  We havethee there  Not at all but I have ye for at the time poor Tashfell in the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contentsleaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the wella doublewelded hammered substance as I have before said much heavier thanthe sea water and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost  Butthe tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the presentinstance materially counteracted by the other parts of the headremaining undetached from it so that it sank very slowly anddeliberately indeed affording Queequeg a fair chance for performinghis agile obstetrics on the run as you may say  Yes it was arunning delivery so it wasNow had Tashtego perished in that head it had been a very preciousperishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrantspermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamberand sanctum sanctorum of the whale  Only one sweeter end can readilybe recalledthe delicious death of an Ohio honeyhunter who seekinghoney in the crotch of a hollow tree found such exceeding store ofit that leaning too far over it sucked him in so that he diedembalmed  How many think ye have likewise fallen into Platoshoney head and sweetly perished thereCHAPTER 79The PrairieTo scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of thisLeviathan this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist hasas yet undertaken  Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopefulas for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock ofGibraltar or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated theDome of the Pantheon  Still in that famous work of his Lavaternot only treats of the various faces of men but also attentivelystudies the faces of horses birds serpents and fish and dwells indetail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein  Norhave Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hintstouching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than manTherefore though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer in theapplication of these two semisciences to the whale I will do myendeavor  I try all things I achieve what I canPhysiognomically regarded the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creatureHe has no proper nose  And since the nose is the central and mostconspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies andfinally controls their combined expression hence it would seem thatits entire absence as an external appendage must very largelyaffect the countenance of the whale  For as in landscape gardeninga spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almostindispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can bephysiognomically in keeping without the elevated openwork belfry ofthe nose  Dash the nose from Phidiass marble Jove and what a sorryremainder  Nevertheless Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude allhis proportions are so stately that the same deficiency which in thesculptured Jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all  Nay itis an added grandeur  A nose to the whale would have beenimpertinent  As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round hisvast head in your jollyboat your noble conceptions of him are neverinsulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled  Apestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtruding evenwhen beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throneIn some particulars perhaps the most imposing physiognomical viewto be had of the Sperm Whale is that of the full front of his headThis aspect is sublimeIn thought a fine human brow is like the East when troubled withthe morning  In the repose of the pasture the curled brow of thebull has a touch of the grand in it  Pushing heavy cannon upmountain defiles the elephants brow is majestic  Human or animalthe mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the GermanEmperors to their decrees  It signifiesGod done this day by myhand  But in most creatures nay in man himself very often thebrow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow lineFew are the foreheads which like Shakespeares or Melancthons riseso high and descend so low that the eyes themselves seem cleareternal tideless mountain lakes and all above them in the foreheadswrinkles you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there todrink as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deerBut in the great Sperm Whale this high and mighty godlike dignityinherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it inthat full front view you feel the Deity and the dread powers moreforcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature  Foryou see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is revealedno nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none proper nothingbut that one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with riddlesdumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and men  Nor inprofile does this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed itsgrandeur does not domineer upon you so  In profile you plainlyperceive that horizontal semicrescentic depression in theforeheads middle which in man is Lavaters mark of geniusBut how  Genius in the Sperm Whale  Has the Sperm Whale everwritten a book spoken a speech  No his great genius is declared inhis doing nothing particular to prove it  It is moreover declared inhis pyramidical silence  And this reminds me that had the greatSperm Whale been known to the young Orient World he would have beendeified by their childmagian thoughts  They deified the crocodileof the Nile because the crocodile is tongueless and the Sperm Whalehas no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small as to beincapable of protrusion  If hereafter any highly cultured poeticalnation shall lure back to their birthright the merry Mayday godsof old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical skyin the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to Joves high seatthe great Sperm Whale shall lord itChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics  But thereis no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every mans and everybeings face  Physiognomy like every other human science is but apassing fable  If then Sir William Jones who read in thirtylanguages could not read the simplest peasants face in itsprofounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered Ishmael hopeto read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whales brow  I but put thatbrow before you  Read it if you canCHAPTER 80The NutIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx to the phrenologisthis brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible tosquareIn the fullgrown creature the skull will measure at least twentyfeet in length  Unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of thisskull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane restingthroughout on a level base  But in lifeas we have elsewhereseenthis inclined plane is angularly filled up and almost squaredby the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm  At thehigh end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass whileunder the long floor of this craterin another cavity seldomexceeding ten inches in length and as many in depthreposes themere handful of this monsters brain  The brain is at least twentyfeet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away behind itsvast outworks like the innermost citadel within the amplifiedfortifications of Quebec  So like a choice casket is it secreted inhim that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that theSperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of oneformed by the cubicyards of his sperm magazine  Lying in strangefolds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it seemsmore in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard thatmystic part of him as the seat of his intelligenceIt is plain then that phrenologically the head of this Leviathanin the creatures living intact state is an entire delusion  As forhis true brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel anyThe whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to thecommon worldIf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear viewof its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by itsresemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation andfrom the same point of view  Indeed place this reversed skullscaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of mens skullsand you would involuntarily confound it with them and remarking thedepressions on one part of its summit in phrenological phrase youwould sayThis man had no selfesteem and no veneration  And bythose negations considered along with the affirmative fact of hisprodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourself the truestthough not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exaltedpotency isBut if from the comparative dimensions of the whales proper brainyou deem it incapable of being adequately charted then I haveanother idea for you  If you attentively regard almost anyquadrupeds spine you will be struck with the resemblance of itsvertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls all bearingrudimental resemblance to the skull proper  It is a German conceitthat the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls  But thecurious external resemblance I take it the Germans were not thefirst men to perceive  A foreign friend once pointed it out to mein the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with the vertebrae ofwhich he was inlaying in a sort of bassorelievo the beaked prowof his canoe  Now I consider that the phrenologists have omitted animportant thing in not pushing their investigations from thecerebellum through the spinal canal  For I believe that much of amans character will be found betokened in his backbone  I wouldrather feel your spine than your skull whoever you are  A thinjoist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul  I rejoicein my spine as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which Ifling half out to the worldApply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale  Hiscranial cavity is continuous with the first neckvertebra and inthat vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inchesacross being eight in height and of a triangular figure with thebase downwards  As it passes through the remaining vertebrae thecanal tapers in size but for a considerable distance remains oflarge capacity  Now of course this canal is filled with much thesame strangely fibrous substancethe spinal cordas the brain anddirectly communicates with the brain  And what is still more formany feet after emerging from the brains cavity the spinal cordremains of an undecreasing girth almost equal to that of the brainUnder all these circumstances would it be unreasonable to survey andmap out the whales spine phrenologically  For viewed in thislight the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper ismore than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of hisspinal cordBut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists Iwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference tothe Sperm Whales hump  This august hump if I mistake not risesover one of the larger vertebrae and is therefore in some sortthe outer convex mould of it  From its relative situation then Ishould call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitablenessin the Sperm Whale  And that the great monster is indomitable youwill yet have reason to knowCHAPTER 81The Pequod Meets The VirginThe predestinated day arrived and we duly met the ship JungfrauDerick De Deer master of BremenAt one time the greatest whaling people in the world the Dutch andGermans are now among the least but here and there at very wideintervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet withtheir flag in the PacificFor some reason the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respectsWhile yet some distance from the Pequod she rounded to anddropping a boat her captain was impelled towards us impatientlystanding in the bows instead of the sternWhat has he in his hand there cried Starbuck pointing tosomething wavingly held by the German  Impossiblea lampfeederNot that said Stubb no no its a coffeepot Mr Starbuckhes coming off to make us our coffee is the Yarman dont you seethat big tin can there alongside of himthats his boiling waterOh hes all right is the YarmanGo along with you cried Flask its a lampfeeder and an oilcanHes out of oil and has come abeggingHowever curious it may seem for an oilship to be borrowing oil onthe whaleground and however much it may invertedly contradict theold proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle yet sometimes such athing really happens and in the present case Captain Derick De Deerdid indubitably conduct a lampfeeder as Flask did declareAs he mounted the deck Ahab abruptly accosted him without at allheeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the Germansoon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale immediatelyturning the conversation to his lampfeeder and oil can with someremarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night inprofound darknesshis last drop of Bremen oil being gone and not asingle flyingfish yet captured to supply the deficiency concludingby hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery istechnically called a CLEAN one that is an empty one welldeserving the name of Jungfrau or the VirginHis necessities supplied Derick departed but he had not gained hisships side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from themastheads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was Derickthat without pausing to put his oilcan and lampfeeder aboard heslewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lampfeedersNow the game having risen to leeward he and the other three Germanboats that soon followed him had considerably the start of thePequods keels  There were eight whales an average pod  Aware oftheir danger they were going all abreast with great speed straightbefore the wind rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans ofhorses in harness  They left a great wide wake as thoughcontinually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the seaFull in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a hugehumped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well asby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemedafflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity  Whether thiswhale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it isnot customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all socialNevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back watermust have retarded him because the whitebone or swell at his broadmuzzle was a dashed one like the swell formed when two hostilecurrents meet  His spout was short slow and laborious comingforth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in tornshreds followed by strange subterranean commotions in him whichseemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing thewaters behind him to upbubbleWhos got some paregoric said Stubb he has the stomachache Imafraid  Lord think of having half an acre of stomachache  Adversewinds are holding mad Christmas in him boys  Its the first foulwind I ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yawso before it must be hes lost his tillerAs an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deckload of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on herway so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and thenpartly turning over on his cumbrous ribends expose the cause of hisdevious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin  Whether hehad lost that fin in battle or had been born without it it werehard to sayOnly wait a bit old chap and Ill give ye a sling for that woundedarm cried cruel Flask pointing to the whaleline near himMind he dont sling thee with it cried Starbuck  Give way orthe German will have himWith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for thisone fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the mostvaluable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales weregoing with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuitfor the time  At this juncture the Pequods keels had shot by thethree German boats last lowered but from the great start he had hadDericks boat still led the chase though every moment neared by hisforeign rivals  The only thing they feared was that from beingalready so nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his ironbefore they could completely overtake and pass him  As for Derickhe seemed quite confident that this would be the case andoccasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lampfeeder at theother boatsThe ungracious and ungrateful dog cried Starbuck he mocks anddares me with the very poorbox I filled for him not five minutesagothen in his old intense whisperGive way greyhounds  Dogto itI tell

this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lampfeeder atthe advancing boats and also his oilcan perhaps with the doubleview of retarding his rivals way and at the same time economicallyaccelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward tossThe unmannerly Dutch dogger cried Stubb  Pull now men likefifty thousand lineofbattleship loads of redhaired devils  Whatdye say Tashtego are you the man to snap your spine intwoandtwenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead  What dye sayI say pull like goddamcried the IndianFiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the German thePequods three boats now began ranging almost abreast and sodisposed momentarily neared him  In that fine loose chivalrousattitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey the threemates stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman withan exhilarating cry of There she slides now  Hurrah for thewhiteash breeze  Down with the Yarman  Sail over himBut so decided an original start had Derick had that spite of alltheir gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race hadnot a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caughtthe blade of his midship oarsman  While this clumsy lubber wasstriving to free his whiteash and while in consequence Dericksboat was nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in amighty ragethat was a good time for Starbuck Stubb and FlaskWith a shout they took a mortal start forwards and slantinglyranged up on the Germans quarter  An instant more and all fourboats were diagonically in the whales immediate wake whilestretching from them on both sides was the foaming swell that hemadeIt was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight  The whale wasnow going head out and sending his spout before him in a continualtormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony offright  Now to this hand now to that he yawed in his falteringflight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodicallysank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beatingfin  So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrightedbroken circles in the air vainly striving to escape the piraticalhawks  But the bird has a voice and with plaintive cries will makeknown her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea waschained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that chokingrespiration through his spiracle and this made the sight of himunspeakably pitiable while still in his amazing bulk portcullisjaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to appal the stoutest manwho so pitiedSeeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequodsboats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his gameDerick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusuallylong dart ere the last chance would for ever escapeBut no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than allthree tigersQueequeg Tashtego Daggooinstinctively sprang totheir feet and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointedtheir barbs and darted over the head of the German harpooneer theirthree Nantucket irons entered the whale  Blinding vapours of foam andwhitefire  The three boats in the first fury of the whalesheadlong rush bumped the Germans aside with such force that bothDerick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed overby the three flying keelsDont be afraid my butterboxes cried Stubb casting a passingglance upon them as he shot by yell be picked up presentlyallrightI saw some sharks asternSt Bernards dogs youknowrelieve distressed travellers  Hurrah this is the way to sailnow  Every keel a sunbeam  HurrahHere we go like three tinkettles at the tail of a mad cougar  This puts me in mind offastening to an elephant in a tilbury on

Jonesall arush down an endless inclined plane  Hurrah this whale carries theeverlasting mailBut the monsters run was a brief one  Giving a sudden gasp hetumultuously sounded  With a grating rush the three lines flewround the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves inthem while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid soundingwould soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous mightthey caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till atlastowing to the perpendicular strain from the leadlined chocks ofthe boats whence the three ropes went straight down into thebluethe gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water whilethe three sterns tilted high in the air  And the whale soon ceasingto sound for some time they remained in that attitude fearful ofexpending more line though the position was a little ticklish  Butthough boats have been taken down and lost in this way yet it isthis holding on as it is called this hooking up by the sharpbarbs of his live flesh from the back this it is that often tormentsthe Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of hisfoes  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to bedoubted whether this course is always the best for it is butreasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stays underwater the more he is exhausted  Because owing to the enormoussurface of himin a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000square feetthe pressure of the water is immense  We all know whatan astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under evenhere aboveground in the air how vast then the burden of awhale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of oceanIt must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres  One whalemanhas estimated it at the weight of twenty lineofbattle ships withall their guns and stores and men on boardAs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing downinto its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of anysort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from itsdepths what landsman would have thought that beneath all thatsilence and placidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhingand wrenching in agony  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope werevisible at the bows  Seems it credible that by three such thinthreads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to aneight day clock  Suspended and to what  To three bits of boardIs this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly saidCanstthou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fishspearsThe sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dartnor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw the arrow cannot makehim flee darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking ofa spear  This the creature this he  Oh that unfulfilments shouldfollow the prophets  For with the strength of a thousand thighs inhis tail Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the seato hide him from the Pequods fishspearsIn that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boatssent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broadenough to shade half Xerxes army  Who can tell how appalling to thewounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over hisheadStand by men he stirs cried Starbuck as the three linessuddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards tothem as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whaleso that every oarsman felt them in his seat  The next momentrelieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows theboats gave a sudden bounce upwards as a small icefield will when adense herd of white bears are scared from it into the seaHaul in  Haul in cried Starbuck again hes risingThe lines of which hardly an instant before not one hands breadthcould have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back alldripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within twoships lengths of the huntersHis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion  In most landanimals there are certain valves or floodgates in many of theirveins whereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at leastinstantly shut off in certain directions  Not so with the whale oneof whose peculiarities it is to have an entire nonvalvular structureof the bloodvessels so that when pierced even by so small a pointas a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his wholearterial system and when this is heightened by the extraordinarypressure of water at a great distance below the surface his life maybe said to pour from him in incessant streams  Yet so vast is thequantity of blood in him and so distant and numerous its interiorfountains that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for aconsiderable period even as in a drought a river will flow whosesource is in the wellsprings of faroff and undiscernible hillsEven now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously drewover his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him theywere followed by steady jets from the new made wound which keptcontinually playing while the natural spouthole in his head wasonly at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moistureinto the air  From this last vent no blood yet came because novital part of him had thus far been struck  His life as theysignificantly call it was untouchedAs the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part ofhis form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainlyrevealed  His eyes or rather the places where his eyes had beenwere beheld  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knotholes ofthe noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whaleseyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiableto see  But pity there was none  For all his old age and his onearm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered inorder to light the gay bridals and other merrymakings of men andalso to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditionalinoffensiveness by all to all  Still rolling in his blood at lasthe partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberancethe size of a bushel low down on the flankA nice spot cried Flask just let me prick him there onceAvast cried Starbuck theres no need of thatBut humane Starbuck was too late  At the instant of the dart anulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into morethan sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood withswift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and theirglorying crews all over with showers of gore capsizing Flasks boatand marring the bows  It was his death stroke  For by this timeso spent was he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away fromthe wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flappedwith his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like awaning world turned up the white secrets of his belly lay like alog and died  It was most piteous that last expiring spout  Aswhen by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from somemighty fountain and with halfstifled melancholy gurglings thespraycolumn lowers and lowers to the groundso the last long dyingspout of the whaleSoon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the bodyshowed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifledImmediately by Starbucks orders lines were secured to it atdifferent points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunkenwhale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords  Byvery heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale wastransferred to her side and was strongly secured there by thestiffest flukechains for it was plain that unless artificiallyupheld the body would at once sink to the bottomIt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with thespade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded inhis flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described  But asthe stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies ofcaptured whales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and noprominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there mustneeds have been some other unknown reason in the present case fullyto account for the ulceration alluded to  But still more curious wasthe fact of a lancehead of stone being found in him not far fromthe buried iron the flesh perfectly firm about it  Who had dartedthat stone lance  And when  It might have been darted by some NorWest Indian long before America was discoveredWhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrouscabinet there is no telling  But a sudden stop was put to furtherdiscoveries by the ships being unprecedentedly dragged oversideways to the sea owing to the bodys immensely increasingtendency to sink  However Starbuck who had the ordering ofaffairs hung on to it to the last hung on to it so resolutelyindeed that when at length the ship would have been capsized ifstill persisting in locking arms with the body then when thecommand was given to break clear from it such was the immovablestrain upon the timberheads to which the flukechains and cableswere fastened that it was impossible to cast them off  Meantimeeverything in the Pequod was aslant  To cross to the other side ofthe deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house  Theship groaned and gasped  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarksand cabins were started from their places by the unnaturaldislocation  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear uponthe immovable flukechains to pry them adrift from the timberheadsand so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends couldnot be at all approached while every moment whole tons ofponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed onthe point of going overHold on hold on wont ye cried Stubb to the body dont be insuch a devil of a hurry to sink  By thunder men we must dosomething or go for it  No use prying there avast I say with yourhandspikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a penknife andcut the big chainsKnife  Aye aye cried Queequeg and seizing the carpenters heavyhatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron beganslashing at the largest flukechains  But a few strokes full ofsparks were given when the exceeding strain effected the restWith a terrific snap every fastening went adrift the ship rightedthe carcase sankNow this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed SpermWhale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequatelyaccounted for it  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with greatbuoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above thesurface  If the only whales that thus sank were old meagre andbrokenhearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all theirbones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assertthat this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in thefish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter inhim  But it is not so  For young whales in the highest health andswelling with noble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warmflush and May of life with all their panting lard about them eventhese brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sinkBe it said however that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to thisaccident than any other species  Where one of that sort go downtwenty Right Whales do  This difference in the species is no doubtimputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in theRight Whale his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than aton from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free  But thereare instances where after the lapse of many hours or several daysthe sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life  But thereason of this is obvious  Gases are generated in him he swells toa prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon  Alineofbattle ship could hardly keep him under then  In the ShoreWhaling on soundings among the Bays of New Zealand when a RightWhale gives token of sinking they fasten buoys to him with plentyof rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to lookfor it when it shall have ascended againIt was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heardfrom the Pequods mastheads announcing that the Jungfrau was againlowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that of aFinBack belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because ofits incredible power of swimming  Nevertheless the FinBacks spoutis so similar to the Sperm Whales that by unskilful fishermen it isoften mistaken for it  And consequently Derick and all his host werenow in valiant chase of this unnearable brute  The Virgin crowdingall sail made after her four young keels and thus they alldisappeared far to leeward still in bold hopeful chaseOh many are the FinBacks and many are the Dericks my friendCHAPTER 82The Honour and Glory of WhalingThere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is thetrue methodThe more I dive into this matter of whaling and push my researchesup to the very springhead of it so much the more am I impressed withits great honourableness and antiquity and especially when I find somany great demigods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one wayor other have shed distinction upon it I am transported with thereflection that I myself belong though but subordinately to soemblazoned a fraternityThe gallant Perseus a son of Jupiter was the first whaleman and tothe eternal honour of our calling be it said that the first whaleattacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intentThose were the knightly days of our profession when we only borearms to succor the distressed and not to fill mens lampfeedersEvery one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda how thelovely Andromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on theseacoast and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her offPerseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned themonster and delivered and married the maid  It was an admirableartistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of thepresent day inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very firstdart  And let no man doubt this Arkite story for in the ancientJoppa now Jaffa on the Syrian coast in one of the Pagan templesthere stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which thecitys legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identicalbones of the monster that Perseus slew  When the Romans took Joppathe same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph  What seems mostsingular and suggestively important in this story is this it wasfrom Joppa that Jonah set sailAkin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromedaindeed by somesupposed to be indirectly derived from itis that famous story ofSt George and the Dragon which dragon I maintain to have been awhale for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangelyjumbled together and often stand for each other  Thou art as alion of the waters and as a dragon of the sea saith Ezekielhereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some versions of the Bibleuse that word itself  Besides it would much subtract from the gloryof the exploit had St George but encountered a crawling reptile ofthe land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deepAny man may kill a snake but only a Perseus a St George aCoffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whaleLet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though thecreature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguelyrepresented of a griffinlike shape and though the battle isdepicted on land and the saint on horseback yet considering thegreat ignorance of those times when the true form of the whale wasunknown to artists and considering that as in Perseus case StGeorges whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach andconsidering that the animal ridden by St George might have been onlya large seal or seahorse bearing all this in mind it will notappear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and theancientest draughts of the scene to hold this socalled dragon noother than the great Leviathan himself  In fact placed before thestrict and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fishflesh and fowl idol of the Philistines Dagon by name who beingplanted before the ark of Israel his horses head and both the palmsof his hands fell off from him and only the stump or fishy part ofhim remained  Thus then one of our own noble stamp even awhaleman is the tutelary guardian of England and by good rights weharpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble orderof St George  And therefore let not the knights of that honourablecompany none of whom I venture to say have ever had to do with awhale like their great patron let them never eye a Nantucketer withdisdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we aremuch better entitled to St Georges decoration than theyWhether to admit Hercules among us or not concerning this I longremained dubious for though according to the Greek mythologies thatantique Crockett and Kit Carsonthat brawny doer of rejoicing gooddeeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whetherthat strictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted  Itnowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unlessindeed from the inside  Nevertheless he may be deemed a sort ofinvoluntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did notthe whale  I claim him for one of our clanBut by the best contradictory authorities this Grecian story ofHercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the stillmore ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale and vice versacertainly they are very similar  If I claim the demigod then whynot the prophetNor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise thewhole roll of our order  Our grand master is still to be named forlike royal kings of old times we find the head waters of ourfraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves  Thatwondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shasterwhich gives us the dread Vishnoo one of the three persons in thegodhead of the Hindoos gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for ourLordVishnoo who by the first of his ten earthly incarnationshas for ever set apart and sanctified the whale  When Brahma or theGod of Gods saith the Shaster resolved to recreate the world afterone of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to Vishnoo topreside over the work but the Vedas or mystical books whoseperusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo beforebeginning the creation and which therefore must have containedsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects theseVedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so Vishnoo becameincarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermostdepths rescued the sacred volumes  Was not this Vishnoo a whalemanthen even as a man who rides a horse is called a horsemanPerseus St George Hercules Jonah and Vishnoo theres amemberroll for you  What club but the whalemans can head off likethatCHAPTER 83Jonah Historically RegardedReference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale inthe preceding chapter  Now some Nantucketers rather distrust thishistorical story of Jonah and the whale  But then there were somesceptical Greeks and Romans who standing out from the orthodoxpagans of their times equally doubted the story of Hercules and thewhale and Arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting thosetraditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts forall thatOne old SagHarbor whalemans chief reason for questioning the Hebrewstory was thisHe had one of those quaint oldfashioned Biblesembellished with curious unscientific plates one of whichrepresented Jonahs whale with two spouts in his heada peculiarityonly true with respect to a species of the Leviathan the RightWhale and the varieties of that order concerning which thefishermen have this saying A penny roll would choke him hisswallow is so very small  But to this Bishop Jebbs anticipativeanswer is ready  It is not necessary hints the Bishop that weconsider Jonah as tombed in the whales belly but as temporarilylodged in some part of his mouth  And this seems reasonable enoughin the good Bishop  For truly the Right Whales mouth wouldaccommodate a couple of whisttables and comfortably seat all theplayers  Possibly too Jonah might have ensconced himself in ahollow tooth but on second thoughts the Right Whale is toothlessAnother reason which SagHarbor he went by that name urged for hiswant of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurelyin reference to his incarcerated body and the whales gastric juicesBut this objection likewise falls to the ground because a Germanexegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floatingbody of a DEAD whaleeven as the French soldiers in the Russiancampaign turned their dead horses into tents and crawled into themBesides it has been divined by other continental commentators thatwhen Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship he straightwayeffected his escape to another vessel near by some vessel with awhale for a figurehead and I would add possibly called TheWhale as some craft are nowadays christened the Shark theGull the Eagle  Nor have there been wanting learned exegetistswho have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merelymeant a lifepreserveran inflated bag of windwhich the endangeredprophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom  PoorSagHarbor therefore seems worsted all round  But he had stillanother reason for his want of faith  It was this if I rememberright Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea andafter three days he was vomited up somewhere within three daysjourney of Nineveh a city on the Tigris very much more than threedays journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterraneancoast  How is thatBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet withinthat short distance of Nineveh  Yes  He might have carried himround by the way of the Cape of Good Hope  But not to speak of thepassage through the whole length of the Mediterranean and anotherpassage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea such a supposition wouldinvolve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three daysnot to speak of the Tigris waters near the site of Nineveh beingtoo shallow for any whale to swim in  Besides this idea of Jonahsweathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest thehonour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diazits reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liarBut all these foolish arguments of old SagHarbor only evinced hisfoolish pride of reasona thing still more reprehensible in himseeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked upfrom the sun and the sea  I say it only shows his foolish impiouspride and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverendclergy  For by a Portuguese Catholic priest this very idea ofJonahs going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as asignal magnification of the general miracle  And so it wasBesides to this day the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believein the historical story of Jonah  And some three centuries ago anEnglish traveller in old Harriss Voyages speaks of a Turkish Mosquebuilt in honour of Jonah in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp thatburnt without any oilCHAPTER 84PitchpolingTo make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages areanointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform ananalogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom  Nor isit to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it maypossibly be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil andwater are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the objectin view is to make the boat slide bravely  Queequeg believedstrongly in anointing his boat and one morning not long after theGerman ship Jungfrau disappeared took more than customary pains inthat occupation crawling under its bottom where it hung over theside and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking toinsure a crop of hair from the crafts bald keel  He seemed to beworking in obedience to some particular presentiment  Nor did itremain unwarranted by the eventTowards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed downto them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy a disorderedflight as of Cleopatras barges from ActiumNevertheless the boats pursued and Stubbs was foremost  By greatexertion Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but thestricken whale without at all sounding still continued hishorizontal flight with added fleetness  Such unintermittedstrainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitablyextract it  It became imperative to lance the flying whale or becontent to lose him  But to haul the boat up to his flank wasimpossible he swam so fast and furious  What then remainedOf all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand andcountless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so oftenforced none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance calledpitchpoling  Small sword or broad sword in all its exercisesboasts nothing like it  It is only indispensable with an inveteraterunning whale its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distanceto which the long lance is accurately darted from a violentlyrocking jerking boat under extreme headway  Steel and woodincluded the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length thestaff is much slighter than that of the harpoon and also of alighter materialpine  It is furnished with a small rope called awarp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to thehand after dartingBut before going further it is important to mention here thatthough the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lanceyet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequentlysuccessful on account of the greater weight and inferior length ofthe harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect becomeserious drawbacks  As a general thing therefore you must firstget fast to a whale before any pitchpoling comes into playLook now at Stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolnessand equanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified toexcel in pitchpoling  Look at him he stands upright in the tossedbow of the flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale isforty feet ahead  Handling the long lance lightly glancing twice orthrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight Stubbwhistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as tosecure its free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructedThen holding the lance full before his waistbands middle he levelsit at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depressesthe buttend in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weaponstands fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen feet in the air  Heminds you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chinNext moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch thebright steel spans the foaming distance and quivers in the life spotof the whale  Instead of sparkling water he now spouts red bloodThat drove the spigot out of him cried Stubb  Tis Julysimmortal Fourth all fountains must run wine today  Would now itwere old Orleans whiskey or old Ohio or unspeakable oldMonongahela  Then Tashtego lad Id have ye hold a canakin to thejet and wed drink round it  Yea verily hearts alive wed brewchoice punch in the spread of his spouthole there and from thatlive punchbowl quaff the living stuffAgain and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart isrepeated the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held inskilful leash  The agonized whale goes into his flurry the towlineis slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his handsand mutely watches the monster dieCHAPTER 85The FountainThat for six thousand yearsand no one knows how many millions ofages beforethe great whales should have been spouting all over thesea and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as withso many sprinkling or mistifying pots and that for some centuriesback thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain ofthe whale watching these sprinklings and spoutingsthat all thisshould be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and aquarter minutes past one oclock PM of this sixteenth day ofDecember AD 1851 it should still remain a problem whether thesespoutings are after all really water or nothing but vapourthis issurely a noteworthy thingLet us then look at this matter along with some interesting itemscontingent  Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of theirgills the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all timesis combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring ora cod might live a century and never once raise its head above thesurface  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives himregular lungs like a human beings the whale can only live byinhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere  Wherefore thenecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world  But hecannot in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinaryattitude the Sperm Whales mouth is buried at least eight feetbeneath the surface and what is still more his windpipe has noconnexion with his mouth  No he breathes through his spiraclealone and this is on the top of his headIf I say that in any creature breathing is only a functionindispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air acertain element which being subsequently brought into contact withthe blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle I do notthink I shall err though I may possibly use some superfluousscientific words  Assume it and it follows that if all the blood ina man could be aerated with one breath he might then seal up hisnostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time  That is tosay he would then live without breathing  Anomalous as it may seemthis is precisely the case with the whale who systematically livesby intervals his full hour and more when at the bottom withoutdrawing a single breath or so much as in any way inhaling a particleof air for remember he has no gills  How is this  Between hisribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkableinvolved Cretan labyrinth of vermicellilike vessels which vesselswhen he quits the surface are completely distended with oxygenatedblood  So that for an hour or more a thousand fathoms in the seahe carries a surplus stock of vitality in him just as the camelcrossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink forfuture use in its four supplementary stomachs  The anatomical factof this labyrinth is indisputable and that the supposition foundedupon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when Iconsider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan inHAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT as the fishermen phrase it  This is what Imean  If unmolested upon rising to the surface the Sperm Whalewill continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all hisother unmolested risings  Say he stays eleven minutes and jetsseventy times that is respires seventy breaths then whenever herises again he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over againto a minute  Now if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm himso that he sounds he will be always dodging up again to make goodhis regular allowance of air  And not till those seventy breaths aretold will he finally go down to stay out his full term belowRemark however that in different individuals these rates aredifferent but in any one they are alike  Now why should the whalethus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenishhis reservoir of air ere descending for good  How obvious is ittoo that this necessity for the whales rising exposes him to allthe fatal hazards of the chase  For not by hook or by net couldthis vast leviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathomsbeneath the sunlight  Not so much thy skill then O hunter as thegreat necessities that strike the victory to theeIn man breathing is incessantly going onone breath only servingfor two or three pulsations so that whatever other business he hasto attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he willBut the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of histimeIt has been said that the whale only breathes through his spoutholeif it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with waterthen I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense ofsmell seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that atall answers to his nose is that identical spouthole and being soclogged with two elements it could not be expected to have the powerof smelling  But owing to the mystery of the spoutwhether it bewater or whether it be vapourno absolute certainty can as yet bearrived at on this head  Sure it is nevertheless that the SpermWhale has no proper olfactories  But what does he want of them  Noroses no violets no Colognewater in the seaFurthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of hisspouting canal and as that long canallike the grand Erie Canalisfurnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downwardretention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore thewhale has no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he sostrangely rumbles he talks through his nose  But then again whathas the whale to say  Seldom have I known any profound being thathad anything to say to this world unless forced to stammer outsomething by way of getting a living  Oh happy that the world issuch an excellent listenerNow the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale chiefly intended as it isfor the conveyance of air and for several feet laid alonghorizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and alittle to one side this curious canal is very much like a gaspipelaid down in a city on one side of a street  But the questionreturns whether this gaspipe is also a waterpipe in other wordswhether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaledbreath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken inat the mouth and discharged through the spiracle  It is certainthat the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal butit cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging waterthrough the spiracle  Because the greatest necessity for so doingwould seem to be when in feeding he accidentally takes in waterBut the Sperm Whales food is far beneath the surface and there hecannot spout even if he would  Besides if you regard him veryclosely and time him with your watch you will find that whenunmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of hisjets and the ordinary periods of respirationBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject  Speakout  You have seen him spout then declare what the spout is canyou not tell water from air  My dear sir in this world it is not soeasy to settle these plain things  I have ever found your plainthings the knottiest of all  And as for this whale spout you mightalmost stand in it and yet be undecided as to what it is preciselyThe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mistenveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water fallsfrom it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get aclose view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the watercascading all around him  And if at such times you should think thatyou really perceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you knowthat they are not merely condensed from its vapour or how do you knowthat they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in thespouthole fissure which is countersunk into the summit of thewhales head  For even when tranquilly swimming through the middaysea in a calm with his elevated hump sundried as a dromedarys inthe desert even then the whale always carries a small basin ofwater on his head as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see acavity in a rock filled up with rainNor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touchingthe precise nature of the whale spout  It will not do for him to bepeering into it and putting his face in it  You cannot go with yourpitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away  For evenwhen coming into slight contact with the outer vapoury shreds of thejet which will often happen your skin will feverishly smart fromthe acridness of the thing so touching it  And I know one whocoming into still closer contact with the spout whether with somescientific object in view or otherwise I cannot say the skinpeeled off from his cheek and arm  Wherefore among whalemen thespout is deemed poisonous they try to evade it  Another thing Ihave heard it said and I do not much doubt it that if the jet isfairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you  The wisest thingthe investigator can do then it seems to me is to let this deadlyspout aloneStill we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish  Myhypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist  And besidesother reasons to this conclusion I am impelled by considerationstouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm WhaleI account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is anundisputed fact that he is never found on soundings or near shoresall other whales sometimes are  He is both ponderous and profoundAnd I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profoundbeings such as Plato Pyrrho the Devil Jupiter Dante and so onthere always goes up a certain semivisible steam while in the actof thinking deep thoughts  While composing a little treatise onEternity I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me and erelong saw reflected there a curious involved worming and undulationin the atmosphere over my head  The invariable moisture of my hairwhile plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thinshingled attic of an August noon this seems an additional argumentfor the above suppositionAnd how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster tobehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vastmild head overhung by a canopy of vapour engendered by hisincommunicable contemplations and that vapouras you will sometimessee itglorified by a rainbow as if Heaven itself had put its sealupon his thoughts  For dye see rainbows do not visit the clearair they only irradiate vapour  And so through all the thick mistsof the dim doubts in my mind divine intuitions now and then shootenkindling my fog with a heavenly ray  And for this I thank God forall have doubts many deny but doubts or denials few along withthem have intuitions  Doubts of all things earthly and intuitionsof some things heavenly this combination makes neither believer norinfidel but makes a man who regards them both with equal eyeCHAPTER 86The TailOther poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelopeand the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights lesscelestial I celebrate a tailReckoning the largest sized Sperm Whales tail to begin at that pointof the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man itcomprises upon its upper surface alone an area of at least fiftysquare feet  The compact round body of its root expands into twobroad firm flat palms or flukes gradually shoaling away to lessthan an inch in thickness  At the crotch or junction these flukesslightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wingsleaving a wide vacancy between  In no living thing are the lines ofbeauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders ofthese flukes  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale thetail will considerably exceed twenty feet acrossThe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cutinto it and you find that three distinct strata compose ituppermiddle and lower  The fibres in the upper and lower layers arelong and horizontal those of the middle one very short and runningcrosswise between the outside layers  This triune structure as muchas anything else imparts power to the tail  To the student of oldRoman walls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to thethin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in thosewonderful relics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute somuch to the great strength of the masonryBut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were notenough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp andwoof of muscular fibres and filaments which passing on either sidethe loins and running down into the flukes insensibly blend withthem and largely contribute to their might so that in the tail theconfluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated toa point  Could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing todo itNor does thisits amazing strength at all tend to cripple thegraceful flexion of its motions where infantileness of easeundulates through a Titanism of power  On the contrary thosemotions derive their most appalling beauty from it  Real strengthnever impairs beauty or harmony but it often bestows it and ineverything imposingly beautiful strength has much to do with themagic  Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting fromthe marble in the carved Hercules and its charm would be gone  Asdevout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse ofGoethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man thatseemed as a Roman triumphal arch  When Angelo paints even God theFather in human form mark what robustness is there  And whateverthey may reveal of the divine love in the Son the soft curledhermaphroditical Italian pictures in which his idea has been mostsuccessfully embodied these pictures so destitute as they are ofall brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negativefeminine one of submission and endurance which on all hands it isconceded form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachingsSuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of that whetherwielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood itbe in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding graceTherein no fairys arm can transcend itFive great motions are peculiar to it  First when used as a fin forprogression Second when used as a mace in battle Third insweeping Fourth in lobtailing Fifth in peaking flukesFirst Being horizontal in its position the Leviathans tail acts ina different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures  Itnever wriggles  In man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiorityTo the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion  Scrollwisecoiled forwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwardsit is this which gives that singular darting leaping motion to themonster when furiously swimming  His sidefins only serve to steerbySecond It is a little significant that while one sperm whale onlyfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless inhis conflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tailIn striking at a boat he swiftly curves away his flukes from it andthe blow is only inflicted by the recoil  If it be made in theunobstructed air especially if it descend to its mark the stroke isthen simply irresistible  No ribs of man or boat can withstand itYour only salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sidewaysthrough the opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancyof the whale boat and the elasticity of its materials a crackedrib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side isgenerally the most serious result  These submerged side blows are sooften received in the fishery that they are accounted mere childsplay  Some one strips off a frock and the hole is stoppedThird I cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whalethe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respectthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of theelephants trunk  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action ofsweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain softslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface ofthe sea and if he feel but a sailors whisker woe to that sailorwhiskers and all  What tenderness there is in that preliminarytouch  Had this tail any prehensile power I should straightwaybethink me of Darmonodes elephant that so frequented theflowermarket and with low salutations presented nosegays todamsels and then caressed their zones  On more accounts than one apity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue inhis tail for I have heard of yet another elephant that when woundedin the fight curved round his trunk and extracted the dartFourth Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security ofthe middle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vastcorpulence of his dignity and kittenlike he plays on the ocean asif it were a hearth  But still you see his power in his play  Thebroad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air then smitingthe surface the thunderous concussion resounds for miles  You wouldalmost think a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed thelight wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity youwould think that that was the smoke from the touchholeFifth As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan theflukes lie considerably below the level of his back they are thencompletely out of sight beneath the surface but when he is about toplunge into the deeps his entire flukes with at least thirty feet ofhis body are tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating amoment till they downwards shoot out of view  Excepting the sublimeBREACHsomewhere else to be describedthis peaking of the whalesflukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animatednature  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seemsspasmodically snatching at the highest heaven  So in dreams have Iseen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw fromthe flame Baltic of Hell  But in gazing at such scenes it is all inall what mood you are in if in the Dantean the devils will occur toyou if in that of Isaiah the archangels  Standing at the mastheadof my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea I once saw alarge herd of whales in the east all heading towards the sun andfor a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes  As it seemedto me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the godswas never beheld even in Persia the home of the fire worshippersAs Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant I thentestified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout of allbeings  For according to King Juba the military elephants ofantiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in theprofoundest silenceThe chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and theelephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunkof the other are concerned should not tend to place those twoopposite organs on an equality much less the creatures to which theyrespectively belong  For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrierto Leviathan so compared with Leviathans tail his trunk is butthe stalk of a lily  The most direful blow from the elephants trunkwere as the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crushand crash of the sperm whales ponderous flukes which in repeatedinstances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all theiroars and crews into the air very much as an Indian juggler tosseshis ballsThough all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whaleand the elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particular theelephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog doesto the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some points ofcurious similitude among these is the spout  It is well known thatthe elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and thenelevating it jet it forth in a streamThe more I consider this mighty tail the more do I deplore myinability to express it  At times there are gestures in it whichthough they would well grace the hand of man remain whollyinexplicable  In an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally arethese mystic gestures that I have heard hunters who have declaredthem akin to FreeMason signs and symbols that the whale indeed bythese methods intelligently conversed with the world  Nor are therewanting other motions of the whale in his general body full ofstrangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailantDissect him how I may then I but go skin deep I know him notand never will  But if I know not even the tail of this whale howunderstand his head much more how comprehend his face when face hehas none  Thou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to saybut my face shall not be seen  But I cannot completely make out hisback parts and hint what he will about his face I say again he hasno faceCHAPTER 87The Grand ArmadaThe long and narrow peninsula of Malacca extending southeastwardfrom the territories of Birmah forms the most southerly point of allAsia  In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the longislands of Sumatra Java Bally and Timor which with many othersform a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting Asia withAustralia and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from thethickly studded oriental archipelagoes  This rampart is pierced byseveral sallyports for the convenience of ships and whalesconspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca  By thestraits of Sunda chiefly vessels bound to China from the westemerge into the China seasThose narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java and standingmidway in that vast rampart of islands buttressed by that bold greenpromontory known to seamen as Java Head they not a littlecorrespond to the central gateway opening into some vast walledempire and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices andsilks and jewels and gold and ivory with which the thousandislands of that oriental sea are enriched it seems a significantprovision of nature that such treasures by the very formation ofthe land should at least bear the appearance however ineffectualof being guarded from the allgrasping western world  The shores ofthe Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresseswhich guard the entrances to the Mediterranean the Baltic and thePropontis  Unlike the Danes these Orientals do not demand theobsequious homage of lowered topsails from the endless procession ofships before the wind which for centuries past by night and by dayhave passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java freighted withthe costliest cargoes of the east  But while they freely waive aceremonial like this they do by no means renounce their claim tomore solid tributeTime out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays lurking among thelow shaded coves and islets of Sumatra have sallied out upon thevessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute atthe point of their spears  Though by the repeated bloodychastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisersthe audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressedyet even at the present day we occasionally hear of English andAmerican vessels which in those waters have been remorselesslyboarded and pillagedWith a fair fresh wind the Pequod was now drawing nigh to thesestraits Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea andthence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented hereand there by the Sperm Whale sweep inshore by the PhilippineIslands and gain the far coast of Japan in time for the greatwhaling season there  By these means the circumnavigating Pequodwould sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of theworld previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific whereAhab though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit firmly countedupon giving battle to Moby Dick in the sea he was most known tofrequent and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumedto be haunting itBut how now in this zoned quest does Ahab touch no land does hiscrew drink air  Surely he will stop for water  Nay  For a longtime now the circusrunning sun has raced within his fiery ringand needs no sustenance but whats in himself  So Ahab  Mark thistoo in the whaler  While other hulls are loaded down with alienstuff to be transferred to foreign wharves the worldwanderingwhaleship carries no cargo but herself and crew their weapons andtheir wants  She has a whole lakes contents bottled in her amplehold  She is ballasted with utilities not altogether with unusablepiglead and kentledge  She carries years water in her  Clear oldprime Nantucket water which when three years afloat theNantucketer in the Pacific prefers to drink before the brackishfluid but yesterday rafted off in casks from the Peruvian or Indianstreams  Hence it is that while other ships may have gone to Chinafrom New York and back again touching at a score of ports thewhaleship in all that interval may not have sighted one grain ofsoil her crew having seen no man but floating seamen likethemselves  So that did you carry them the news that another floodhad come they would only answerWell boys heres the arkNow as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast ofJava in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda indeed as mostof the ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermenas an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the Pequod gainedmore and more upon Java Head the lookouts were repeatedly hailedand admonished to keep wide awake  But though the green palmy cliffsof the land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delightednostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a singlejet was descried  Almost renouncing all thought of falling in withany game hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits whenthe customary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long aspectacle of singular magnificence saluted usBut here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity withwhich of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the SpermWhales instead of almost invariably sailing in small detachedcompanies as in former times are now frequently met with inextensive herds sometimes embracing so great a multitude that itwould almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemnleague and covenant for mutual assistance and protection  To thisaggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans may beimputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds youmay now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without beinggreeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by whatsometimes seems thousands on thousandsBroad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles andforming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizona continuous chain of whalejets were upplaying and sparkling in thenoonday air  Unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of theRight Whale which dividing at top fall over in two branches likethe cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forwardslantingspout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mistcontinually rising and falling away to leewardSeen from the Pequods deck then as she would rise on a high hillof the sea this host of vapoury spouts individually curling up intothe air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish hazeshowed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolisdescried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a heightAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountainsaccelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passagein their rear and once more expand in comparative security upon theplain even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurryingforward through the straits gradually contracting the wings of theirsemicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescenticcentreCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them the harpooneershandling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of theiryet suspended boats  If the wind only held little doubt had theythat chased through these Straits of Sunda the vast host would onlydeploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few oftheir number  And who could tell whether in that congregatedcaravan Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming likethe worshipped whiteelephant in the coronation procession of theSiamese  So with stunsail piled on stunsail we sailed alongdriving these leviathans before us when of a sudden the voice ofTashtego was heard loudly directing attention to something in ourwakeCorresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in ourrear  It seemed formed of detached white vapours rising and fallingsomething like the spouts of the whales only they did not socompletely come and go for they constantly hovered without finallydisappearing  Levelling his glass at this sight Ahab quicklyrevolved in his pivothole crying Aloft there and rig whips andbuckets to wet the sailsMalays sir and after usAs if too long lurking behind the headlands till the Pequod shouldfairly have entered the straits these rascally Asiatics were now inhot pursuit to make up for their overcautious delay  But when theswift Pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chasehow very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speedingher on to her own chosen pursuitmere ridingwhips and rowels toher that they were  As with glass under arm Ahab toandfro pacedthe deck in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased andin the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some suchfancy as the above seemed his  And when he glanced upon the greenwalls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing andbethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeanceand beheld how that through that same gate he was now both chasingand being chased to his deadly end and not only that but a herd ofremorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils wereinfernally cheering him on with their curseswhen all theseconceits had passed through his brain Ahabs brow was left gaunt andribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has beengnawing it without being able to drag the firm thing from its placeBut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew andwhen after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern thePequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatraside emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then theharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had beengaining upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had sovictoriously gained upon the Malays  But still driving on in thewake of the whales at length they seemed abating their speedgradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word waspassed to spring to the boats  But no sooner did the herd by somepresumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale become notified ofthe three keels that were after themthough as yet a mile in theirrearthan they rallied again and forming in close ranks andbattalions so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines ofstacked bayonets moved on with redoubled velocityStripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the whiteash andafter several hours pulling were almost disposed to renounce thechase when a general pausing commotion among the whales gaveanimating token that they were now at last under the influence ofthat strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when thefishermen perceive it in the whale they say he is gallied  Thecompact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly andsteadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout andlike King Porus elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander theyseemed going mad with consternation  In all directions expanding invast irregular circles and aimlessly swimming hither and thither bytheir short thick spoutings they plainly betrayed their distractionof panic  This was still more strangely evinced by those of theirnumber who completely paralysed as it were helplessly floated likewaterlogged dismantled ships on the sea  Had these Leviathans beenbut a flock of simple sheep pursued over the pasture by three fiercewolves they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismayBut this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herdingcreatures  Though banding together in tens of thousands thelionmaned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitaryhorseman  Witness too all human beings how when herded togetherin the sheepfold of a theatres pit they will at the slightestalarm of fire rush helterskelter for the outlets crowdingtrampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to deathBest therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely galliedwhales before us for there is no folly of the beasts of the earthwhich is not infinitely outdone by the madness of menThough many of the whales as has been said were in violent motionyet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advancednor retreated but collectively remained in one place  As iscustomary in those cases the boats at once separated each makingfor some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal  In aboutthree minutes time Queequegs harpoon was flung the stricken fishdarted blinding spray in our faces and then running away with us likelight steered straight for the heart of the herd  Though such amovement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances isin no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or lessanticipated yet does it present one of the more perilousvicissitudes of the fishery  For as the swift monster drags youdeeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid adieu tocircumspect life and only exist in a delirious throbAs blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer powerof speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to himas we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menaced as weflew by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us our besetboat was like a ship mobbed by iceisles in a tempest and strivingto steer through their complicated channels and straits knowing not atwhat moment it may be locked in and crushedBut not a bit daunted Queequeg steered us manfully now sheering offfrom this monster directly across our route in advance now edgingaway from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead whileall the time Starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand prickingout of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts forthere was no time to make long ones  Nor were the oarsmen quiteidle though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed withThey chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business  Out ofthe way Commodore cried one to a great dromedary that of a suddenrose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatened to swampus  Hard down with your tail there cried a second to anotherwhich close to our gunwale seemed calmly cooling himself with hisown fanlike extremityAll whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originallyinvented by the Nantucket Indians called druggs  Two thick squaresof wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that theycross each others grain at right angles a line of considerablelength is then attached to the middle of this block and the otherend of the line being looped it can in a moment be fastened to aharpoon  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is usedFor then more whales are close round you than you can possiblychase at one time  But sperm whales are not every day encounteredwhile you may then you must kill all you can  And if you cannotkill them all at once you must wing them so that they can beafterwards killed at your leisure  Hence it is that at times likethese the drugg comes into requisition  Our boat was furnished withthree of them  The first and second were successfully darted and wesaw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by the enormoussidelong resistance of the towing drugg  They were cramped likemalefactors with the chain and ball  But upon flinging the third inthe act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught underone of the seats of the boat and in an instant tore it out andcarried it away dropping the oarsman in the boats bottom as theseat slid from under him  On both sides the sea came in at thewounded planks but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts inand so stopped the leaks for the timeIt had been next to impossible to dart these druggedharpoons wereit not that as we advanced into the herd our whales way greatlydiminished moreover that as we went still further and further fromthe circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waningSo that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towingwhale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his partingmomentum we glided between two whales into the innermost heart ofthe shoal as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serenevalley lake  Here the storms in the roaring glens between theoutermost whales were heard but not felt  In this central expansethe sea presented that smooth satinlike surface called a sleekproduced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his morequiet moods  Yes we were now in that enchanted calm which they saylurks at the heart of every commotion  And still in the distracteddistance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles andsaw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly goinground and round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring and soclosely shoulder to shoulder that a Titanic circusrider mighteasily have overarched the middle ones and so have gone round ontheir backs  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whalesmore immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd nopossible chance of escape was at present afforded us  We must watchfor a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in the wall that hadonly admitted us in order to shut us up  Keeping at the centre ofthe lake we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calvesthe women and children of this routed hostNow inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolvingouter circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various podsin any one of those circles the entire area at this junctureembraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two orthree square miles  At any ratethough indeed such a test at such atime might be deceptivespoutings might be discovered from our lowboat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon  Imention this circumstance because as if the cows and calves hadbeen purposely locked up in this innermost fold and as if the wideextent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning theprecise cause of its stopping or possibly being so youngunsophisticated and every way innocent and inexperienced however itmay have been these smaller whalesnow and then visiting ourbecalmed boat from the margin of the lakeevinced a wondrousfearlessness and confidence or else a still becharmed panic which itwas impossible not to marvel at  Like household dogs they camesnuffling round us right up to our gunwales and touching them tillit almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated themQueequeg patted their foreheads Starbuck scratched their backs withhis lance but fearful of the consequences for the time refrainedfrom darting itBut far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another andstill stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side  Forsuspended in those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursingmothers of the whales and those that by their enormous girth seemedshortly to become mothers  The lake as I have hinted was to aconsiderable depth exceedingly transparent and as human infantswhile suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast asif leading two different lives at the time and while yet drawingmortal nourishment be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthlyreminiscenceeven so did the young of these whales seem looking uptowards us but not at us as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed intheir newborn sight  Floating on their sides the mothers alsoseemed quietly eyeing us  One of these little infants that fromcertain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old might have measuredsome fourteen feet in length and some six feet in girth  He was alittle frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recoveredfrom that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternalreticule where tail to head and all ready for the final springthe unborn whale lies bent like a Tartars bow  The delicatesidefins and the palms of his flukes still freshly retained theplaited crumpled appearance of a babys ears newly arrived fromforeign partsLine line cried Queequeg looking over the gunwale him fasthim fastWho line him  Who struckTwo whale one big onelittleWhat ails ye man cried StarbuckLooke here said Queequeg pointing downAs when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeled out hundredsof fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he floats up again andshows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spirallingtowards the air so now Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilicalcord of Madame Leviathan by which the young cub seemed stilltethered to its dam  Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of thechase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomesentangled with the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trappedSome of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us inthis enchanted pond  We saw young Leviathan amours in the deepThe sperm whale as with all other species of the Leviathan butunlike most other fish breeds indifferently at all seasons after agestation which may probably be set down at nine months producingbut one at a time though in some few known instances giving birth toan Esau and Jacoba contingency provided for in suckling by twoteats curiously situated one on each side of the anus but thebreasts themselves extend upwards from that  When by chance theseprecious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunters lance themothers pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea forrods  The milk is very sweet and rich it has been tasted by man itmight do well with strawberries  When overflowing with mutualesteem the whales salute MORE HOMINUMAnd thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternationsand affrights did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freelyand fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenelyrevelled in dalliance and delight  But even so amid the tornadoedAtlantic of my being do I myself still for ever centrally disport inmute calm and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve roundme deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternalmildness of joyMeanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden franticspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boatsstill engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host orpossibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundanceof room and some convenient retreats were afforded them  But thesight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting toand fro across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyesIt is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonlypowerful and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were bysundering or maiming his gigantic tailtendon  It is done by dartinga shorthandled cuttingspade to which is attached a rope forhauling it back again  A whale wounded as we afterwards learned inthis part but not effectually as it seemed had broken away fromthe boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and inthe extraordinary agony of the wound he was now dashing among therevolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold at thebattle of Saratoga carrying dismay wherever he wentBut agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appallingspectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which heseemed to inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which atfirst the intervening distance obscured from us  But at length weperceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fisherythis whale had become entangled in the harpoonline that he towed hehad also run away with the cuttingspade in him and while the freeend of the rope attached to that weapon had permanently caught inthe coils of the harpoonline round his tail the cuttingspadeitself had worked loose from his flesh  So that tormented tomadness he was now churning through the water violently flailingwith his flexible tail and tossing the keen spade about himwounding and murdering his own comradesThis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from theirstationary fright  First the whales forming the margin of our lakebegan to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if liftedby half spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintlyto heave and swell the submarine bridalchambers and nurseriesvanished in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the morecentral circles began to swim in thickening clusters  Yes the longcalm was departing  A low advancing hum was soon heard and thenlike to the tumultuous masses of blockice when the great riverHudson breaks up in Spring the entire host of whales came tumblingupon their inner centre as if to pile themselves up in one commonmountain  Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places Starbucktaking the sternOars  Oars he intensely whispered seizing the helmgripe youroars and clutch your souls now  My God men stand by  Shove himoff you Queequegthe whale thereprick himhit him  Standupstand up and stay so  Spring menpull men never mind theirbacksscrape themscrape awayThe boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leavinga narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths  But by desperateendeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving wayrapidly and at the same time earnestly watching for another outletAfter many similar hairbreadth escapes we at last swiftly glidedinto what had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed byrandom whales all violently making for one centre  This luckysalvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequegs hat whowhile standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales had his hattaken clean from his head by the aireddy made by the sudden tossingof a pair of broad flukes close byRiotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soonresolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for havingclumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed theironward flight with augmented fleetness  Further pursuit was uselessbut the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what druggedwhales might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one whichFlask had killed and waifed  The waif is a pennoned pole two orthree of which are carried by every boat and which when additionalgame is at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of adead whale both to mark its place on the sea and also as token ofprior possession should the boats of any other ship draw nearThe result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of thatsagacious saying in the Fisherythe more whales the less fish  Ofall the drugged whales only one was captured  The rest contrived toescape for the time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seenby some other craft than the PequodCHAPTER 88Schools and SchoolmastersThe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of SpermWhales and there was also then given the probable cause inducingthose vast aggregationsNow though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as musthave been seen even at the present day small detached bands areoccasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individualseach  Such bands are known as schools  They generally are of twosorts those composed almost entirely of females and those musteringnone but young vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarlydesignatedIn cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably seea male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarmevinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flightof his ladies  In truth this gentleman is a luxurious Ottomanswimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied byall the solaces and endearments of the harem  The contrast betweenthis Ottoman and his concubines is striking because while he isalways of the largest leviathanic proportions the ladies even atfull growth are not more than onethird of the bulk of anaveragesized male  They are comparatively delicate indeed I daresay not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist  Neverthelessit cannot be denied that upon the whole they are hereditarilyentitled to EMBONPOINTIt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolentramblings  Like fashionables they are for ever on the move inleisurely search of variety  You meet them on the Line in time forthe full flower of the Equatorial feeding season having justreturned perhaps from spending the summer in the Northern seas andso cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth  By thetime they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equatorawhile they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of thecool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature ofthe yearWhen serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strangesuspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on hisinteresting family  Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathancoming that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of theladies with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him and chaseshim away  High times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like himare to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss thoughdo what the Bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious Lotharioout of his bed for alas all fish bed in common  As ashore theladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rivaladmirers just so with the whales who sometimes come to deadlybattle and all for love  They fence with their long lower jawssometimes locking them together and so striving for the supremacylike elks that warringly interweave their antlers  Not a few arecaptured having the deep scars of these encountersfurrowed headsbroken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched anddislocated mouthsBut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away atthe first rush of the harems lord then is it very diverting towatch that lord  Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them againand revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to youngLothario like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousandconcubines  Granting other whales to be in sight the fishermenwill seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks for these GrandTurks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousnessis small  As for the sons and the daughters they beget why those sonsand daughters must take care of themselves at least with only thematernal help  For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers thatmight be named my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery howevermuch for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves hisanonymous babies all over the world every baby an exotic  In goodtime nevertheless as the ardour of youth declines as years anddumps increase as reflection lends her solemn pauses in short as ageneral lassitude overtakes the sated Turk then a love of ease andvirtue supplants the love for maidens our Ottoman enters upon theimpotent repentant admonitory stage of life forswears disbandsthe harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul goes about allalone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers andwarning each young Leviathan from his amorous errorsNow as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school sois the lord and master of that school technically known as theschoolmaster  It is therefore not in strict character howeveradmirably satirical that after going to school himself he shouldthen go abroad inculcating not what he learned there but the follyof it  His title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derivedfrom the name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmisedthat the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale musthave read the memoirs of Vidocq and informed himself what sort of acountryschoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger daysand what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated intosome of his pupilsThe same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whalebetakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged SpermWhales  Almost universally a lone whaleas a solitary Leviathan iscalledproves an ancient one  Like venerable mossbearded DanielBoone he will have no one near him but Nature herself and her hetakes to wife in the wilderness of waters and the best of wives sheis though she keeps so many moody secretsThe schools composing none but young and vigorous males previouslymentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem schools  For whilethose female whales are characteristically timid the young males orfortybarrelbulls as they call them are by far the most pugnaciousof all Leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounterexcepting those wondrous greyheaded grizzled whales sometimes metand these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penalgoutThe Fortybarrelbull schools are larger than the harem schoolsLike a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun andwickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollickingrate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than hewould a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard  They soon relinquish thisturbulence though and when about threefourths grown break up andseparately go about in quest of settlements that is haremsAnother point of difference between the male and female schools isstill more characteristic of the sexes  Say you strike aFortybarrelbullpoor devil all his comrades quit him  But strikea member of the harem school and her companions swim around her withevery token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so longas themselves to fall a preyCHAPTER 89FastFish and LooseFishThe allusion to the waif and waifpoles in the last chapter but onenecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whalefishery of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badgeIt frequently happens that when several ships are cruising incompany a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and befinally killed and captured by another vessel and herein areindirectly comprised many minor contingencies all partaking of thisone grand feature  For exampleafter a weary and perilous chaseand capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship byreason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward beretaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongsidewithout risk of life or line  Thus the most vexatious and violentdisputes would often arise between the fishermen were there not somewritten or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to allcasesPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislativeenactment was that of Holland  It was decreed by the StatesGeneralin AD 1695  But though no other nation has ever had any writtenwhaling law yet the American fishermen have been their ownlegislators and lawyers in this matter  They have provided a systemwhich for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinians Pandects andthe Bylaws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddlingwith other Peoples Business  Yes these laws might be engraven on aQueen Annes forthing or the barb of a harpoon and worn round theneck so small are theyI  A FastFish belongs to the party fast to itII  A LooseFish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch itBut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirablebrevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries toexpound itFirst What is a FastFish  Alive or dead a fish is technicallyfast when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by anymedium at all controllable by the occupant or occupantsa mast anoar a nineinch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb itis all the same  Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears awaif or any other recognised symbol of possession so long as theparty waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take italongside as well as their intention so to doThese are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of thewhalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harderknocksthe CokeuponLittleton of the fist  True among the moreupright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made forpeculiar cases where it would be an outrageous moral injustice forone party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killedby another party  But others are by no means so scrupulousSome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whaletroverlitigated in England wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after ahard chase of a whale in the Northern seas and when indeed they theplaintiffs had succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at lastthrough peril of their lives obliged to forsake not only theirlines but their boat itself  Ultimately the defendants the crew ofanother ship came up with the whale struck killed seized andfinally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs  Andwhen those defendants were remonstrated with their captain snappedhis fingers in the plaintiffs teeth and assured them that by way ofdoxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their lineharpoons and boat which had remained attached to the whale at thetime of the seizure  Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for therecovery of the value of their whale line harpoons and boatMr Erskine was counsel for the defendants Lord Ellenborough was thejudge  In the course of the defence the witty Erskine went on toillustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con casewherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wifesviciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but inthe course of years repenting of that step he instituted an actionto recover possession of her  Erskine was on the other side and hethen supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originallyharpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason ofthe great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandonedher yet abandon her he did so that she became a loosefish andtherefore when a subsequent gentleman reharpooned her the lady thenbecame that subsequent gentlemans property along with whateverharpoon might have been found sticking in herNow in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of thewhale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each otherThese pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard thevery learned Judge in set terms decided to witThat as for theboat he awarded it to the plaintiffs because they had merelyabandoned it to save their lives but that with regard to thecontroverted whale harpoons and line they belonged to thedefendants the whale because it was a LooseFish at the time of thefinal capture and the harpoons and line because when the fish madeoff with them it the fish acquired a property in those articlesand hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to themNow the defendants afterwards took the fish ergo the aforesaidarticles were theirsA common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judgemight possibly object to it  But ploughed up to the primary rock ofthe matter the two great principles laid down in the twin whalinglaws previously quoted and applied and elucidated by LordEllenborough in the above cited case these two laws touchingFastFish and LooseFish I say will on reflection be found thefundamentals of all human jurisprudence for notwithstanding itscomplicated tracery of sculpture the Temple of the Law like theTemple of the Philistines has but two props to stand onIs it not a saying in every ones mouth Possession is half of thelaw that is regardless of how the thing came into possession  Butoften possession is the whole of the law  What are the sinews andsouls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but FastFish whereofpossession is the whole of the law  What to the rapacious landlordis the widows last mite but a FastFish  What is yonder undetectedvillains marble mansion with a doorplate for a waif what is thatbut a FastFish  What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai thebroker gets from poor Woebegone the bankrupt on a loan tokeep Woebegones family from starvation what is that ruinousdiscount but a FastFish  What is the Archbishop of Savesoulsincome of L100000 seized from the scant bread and cheese ofhundreds of thousands of brokenbacked laborers all sure of heavenwithout any of Savesouls help what is that globular L100000 but aFastFish  What are the Duke of Dunders hereditary towns andhamlets but FastFish  What to that redoubted harpooneer John Bullis poor Ireland but a FastFish  What to that apostolic lancerBrother Jonathan is Texas but a FastFish  And concerning allthese is not Possession the whole of the lawBut if the doctrine of FastFish be pretty generally applicable thekindred doctrine of LooseFish is still more widely so  That isinternationally and universally applicableWhat was America in 1492 but a LooseFish in which Columbus struckthe Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master andmistress  What was Poland to the Czar  What Greece to the TurkWhat India to England  What at last will Mexico be to the UnitedStates  All LooseFishWhat are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World butLooseFish  What all mens minds and opinions but LooseFish  Whatis the principle of religious belief in them but a LooseFish  Whatto the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkersbut LooseFish  What is the great globe itself but a LooseFishAnd what are you reader but a LooseFish and a FastFish tooCHAPTER 90Heads or TailsDe balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput et regina caudamBRACTON L 3 C 3Latin from the books of the Laws of England which taken along withthe context means that of all whales captured by anybody on thecoast of that land the King as Honourary Grand Harpooneer must havethe head and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail  Adivision which in the whale is much like halving an apple there isno intermediate remainder  Now as this law under a modified formis to this day in force in England and as it offers in variousrespects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast andLooseFish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the samecourteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at theexpense of a separate car specially reserved for the accommodationof royalty  In the first place in curious proof of the fact thatthe abovementioned law is still in force I proceed to lay beforeyou a circumstance that happened within the last two yearsIt seems that some honest mariners of Dover or Sandwich or some oneof the Cinque Ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing andbeaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar offfrom the shore  Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow underthe jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a LordWarden  Holding the office directly from the crown I believe allthe royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories becomeby assignment his  By some writers this office is called a sinecureBut not so  Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times infobbing his perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that samefobbing of themNow when these poor sunburnt mariners barefooted and with theirtrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauled theirfat fish high and dry promising themselves a good L150 from theprecious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with theirwives and good ale with their cronies upon the strength of theirrespective shares up steps a very learned and most Christian andcharitable gentleman with a copy of Blackstone under his arm andlaying it upon the whales head he saysHands off this fish mymasters is a FastFish  I seize it as the Lord Wardens  Uponthis the poor mariners in their respectful consternationso trulyEnglishknowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching theirheads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to thestranger  But that did in nowise mend the matter or at all softenthe hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of BlackstoneAt length one of them after long scratching about for his ideasmade bold to speakPlease sir who is the Lord WardenThe DukeBut the duke had nothing to do with taking this fishIt is hisWe have been at great trouble and peril and some expense and isall that to go to the Dukes benefit we getting nothing at all forour pains but our blistersIt is hisIs the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode ofgetting a livelihoodIt is hisI thought to relieve my old bedridden mother by part of my share ofthis whaleIt is hisWont the Duke be content with a quarter or a halfIt is hisIn a word the whale was seized and sold and his Grace the Duke ofWellington received the money  Thinking that viewed in someparticular lights the case might by a bare possibility in some smalldegree be deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one anhonest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to hisGrace begging him to take the case of those unfortunate marinersinto full consideration  To which my Lord Duke in substance repliedboth letters were published that he had already done so andreceived the money and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman iffor the future he the reverend gentleman would decline meddlingwith other peoples business  Is this the still militant old manstanding at the corners of the three kingdoms on all hands coercingalms of beggarsIt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of theDuke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign  We mustneeds inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originallyinvested with that right  The law itself has already been set forthBut Plowdon gives us the reason for it  Says Plowdon the whale socaught belongs to the King and Queen because of its superiorexcellence  And by the soundest commentators this has ever beenheld a cogent argument in such mattersBut why should the King have the head and the Queen the tail  Areason for that ye lawyersIn his treatise on QueenGold or Queenpinmoney an old KingsBench author one William Prynne thus discourseth Ye tail is yeQueens that ye Queens wardrobe may be supplied with ye whaleboneNow this was written at a time when the black limber bone of theGreenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies bodices  Butthis same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sadmistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne  But is the Queen amermaid to be presented with a tail  An allegorical meaning maylurk hereThere are two royal fish so styled by the English law writersthewhale and the sturgeon both royal property under certainlimitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crownsordinary revenue  I know not that any other author has hinted of thematter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must bedivided in the same way as the whale the King receiving the highlydense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolicallyregarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumedcongeniality  And thus there seems a reason in all things even inlawCHAPTER 91The Pequod Meets The RoseBudIn vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of thisLeviathan insufferable fetor denying not inquirySIR T BROWNE VEIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and whenwe were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapoury midday sea that themany noses on the Pequods deck proved more vigilant discoverers thanthe three pairs of eyes aloft  A peculiar and not very pleasantsmell was smelt in the seaI will bet something now said Stubb that somewhere hereaboutsare some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day  I thoughtthey would keel up before longPresently the vapours in advance slid aside and there in thedistance lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort ofwhale must be alongside  As we glided nearer the stranger showedFrench colours from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vultureseafowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it wasplain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call ablasted whale that is a whale that has died unmolested on the seaand so floated an unappropriated corpse  It may well be conceivedwhat an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an Assyriancity in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury thedeparted  So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that nocupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it  Yet are therethose who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oilobtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and by nomeans of the nature of attarofroseComing still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that theFrenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemedeven more of a nosegay than the first  In truth it turned out to beone of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with asort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunctbodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil  Neverthelessin the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will everturn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shunblasted whales in generalThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that Stubb vowed herecognised his cutting spadepole entangled in the lines that wereknotted round the tail of one of these whalesTheres a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing inthe ships bows theres a jackal for ye  I well know that theseCrappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimeslowering their boats for breakers mistaking them for Sperm Whalespouts yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their holdfull of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeingthat all the oil they will get wont be enough to dip the Captainswick into aye we all know these things but look ye heres aCrappo that is content with our leavings the drugged whale there Imean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bones of thatother precious fish he has there  Poor devil  I say pass round ahat some one and lets make him a present of a little oil for dearcharitys sake  For what oil hell get from that drugged whalethere wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemnedcell  And as for the other whale why Ill agree to get more oil bychopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than hell getfrom that bundle of bones though now that I think of it it maycontain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris  Iwonder now if our old man has thought of that  Its worth tryingYes Im for it and so saying he started for the quarterdeckBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm so thatwhether or no the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell withno hope of escaping except by its breezing up again  Issuing fromthe cabin Stubb now called his boats crew and pulled off for thestranger  Drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordancewith the fanciful French taste the upper part of her stempiece wascarved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted greenand for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and therethe whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright redcolour  Upon her head boards in large gilt letters he read Boutonde RoseRosebutton or Rosebud and this was the romantic nameof this aromatic shipThough Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscriptionyet the word ROSE and the bulbous figurehead put togethersufficiently explained the whole to himA wooden rosebud eh he cried with his hand to his nose thatwill do very well but how like all creation it smellsNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck hehad to pull round the bows to the starboard side and thus come closeto the blasted whale and so talk over itArrived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose hebawledBoutondeRose ahoy are there any of you BoutondeRosesthat speak EnglishYes rejoined a Guernseyman from the bulwarks who turned out tobe the chiefmateWell then my BoutondeRosebud have you seen the White WhaleWHAT whaleThe WHITE Whalea Sperm WhaleMoby Dick have ye seen himNever heard of such a whale  Cachalot Blanche  White WhalenoVery good then good bye now and Ill call again in a minuteThen rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod and seeing Ahab leaningover the quarterdeck rail awaiting his report he moulded his twohands into a trumpet and shoutedNo Sir  No  Upon which Ahabretired and Stubb returned to the FrenchmanHe now perceived that the Guernseyman who had just got into thechains and was using a cuttingspade had slung his nose in a sortof bagWhats the matter with your nose there said Stubb  Broke itI wish it was broken or that I didnt have any nose at allanswered the Guernseyman who did not seem to relish the job he wasat very much  But what are you holding YOURS forOh nothing  Its a wax nose I have to hold it on  Fine dayaint it  Air rather gardenny I should say throw us a bunch ofposies will ye BoutondeRoseWhat in the devils name do you want here roared the Guernseymanflying into a sudden passionOh keep coolcool yes thats the word why dont you pack thosewhales in ice while youre working at em  But joking aside thoughdo you know Rosebud that its all nonsense trying to get any oilout of such whales  As for that dried up one there he hasnt agill in his whole carcaseI know that well enough but dye see the Captain here wontbelieve it this is his first voyage he was a Cologne manufacturerbefore  But come aboard and mayhap hell believe you if he wontme and so Ill get out of this dirty scrapeAnything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoinedStubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck  There a queerscene presented itself  The sailors in tasselled caps of redworsted were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whalesBut they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed inanything but a good humor  All their noses upwardly projected fromtheir faces like so many jibbooms  Now and then pairs of them woulddrop their work and run up to the masthead to get some fresh airSome thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coaltarand at intervals held it to their nostrils  Others having broken thestems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl were vigorouslypuffing tobaccosmoke so that it constantly filled theirolfactoriesStubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceedingfrom the Captains roundhouse abaft and looking in that directionsaw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajarfrom within  This was the tormented surgeon who after in vainremonstrating against the proceedings of the day had betaken himselfto the Captains roundhouse CABINET he called it to avoid thepest but still could not help yelling out his entreaties andindignations at timesMarking all this Stubb argued well for his scheme and turning tothe Guernseyman had a little chat with him during which thestranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceitedignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitablea pickle  Sounding him carefully Stubb further perceived that theGuernseyman had not the slightest suspicion concerning theambergris  He therefore held his peace on that head but otherwisewas quite frank and confidential with him so that the two quicklyconcocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing theCaptain without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerityAccording to this little plan of theirs the Guernseyman undercover of an interpreters office was to tell the Captain what hepleased but as coming from Stubb and as for Stubb he was to utterany nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interviewBy this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin  He was asmall and dark but rather delicate looking man for a seacaptainwith large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cottonvelvet vest with watchseals at his side  To this gentleman Stubbwas now politely introduced by the Guernseyman who at onceostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between themWhat shall I say to him first said heWhy said Stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and sealsyou may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyishto me though I dont pretend to be a judgeHe says Monsieur said the Guernseyman in French turning to hiscaptain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captainand chiefmate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught froma blasted whale they had brought alongsideUpon this the captain started and eagerly desired to know moreWhat now said the Guernseyman to StubbWhy since he takes it so easy tell him that now I have eyed himcarefully Im quite certain that hes no more fit to command awhaleship than a St Jago monkey  In fact tell him from me hes ababoonHe vows and declares Monsieur that the other whale the dried oneis far more deadly than the blasted one in fine Monsieur heconjures us as we value our lives to cut loose from these fishInstantly the captain ran forward and in a loud voice commanded hiscrew to desist from hoisting the cuttingtackles and at once castloose the cables and chains confining the whales to the shipWhat now said the Guernseyman when the Captain had returned tothemWhy let me see yes you may as well tell him now thatthatinfact tell him Ive diddled him and aside to himself perhapssomebody elseHe says Monsieur that hes very happy to have been of any serviceto usHearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful partiesmeaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting Stubb downinto his cabin to drink a bottle of BordeauxHe wants you to take a glass of wine with him said theinterpreterThank him heartily but tell him its against my principles to drinkwith the man Ive diddled  In fact tell him I must goHe says Monsieur that his principles wont admit of his drinkingbut that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink thenMonsieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away fromthese whales for its so calm they wont driftBy this time Stubb was over the side and getting into his boathailed the Guernseyman to this effectthat having a long towlinein his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling outthe lighter whale of the two from the ships side  While theFrenchmans boats then were engaged in towing the ship one wayStubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other wayostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long towlinePresently a breeze sprang up Stubb feigned to cast off from thewhale hoisting his boats the Frenchman soon increased his distancewhile the Pequod slid in between him and Stubbs whale  WhereuponStubb quickly pulled to the floating body and hailing the Pequod togive notice of his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit ofhis unrighteous cunning  Seizing his sharp boatspade he commencedan excavation in the body a little behind the side fin  You wouldalmost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea andwhen at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was liketurning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loamHis boats crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping theirchief and looking as anxious as goldhuntersAnd all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking andscreaming and yelling and fighting around them  Stubb wasbeginning to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegayincreased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plaguethere stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tideof bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will flowinto and then along with another without at all blending with it fora timeI have it I have it cried Stubb with delight striking somethingin the subterranean regions a purse a purseDropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls ofsomething that looked like ripe Windsor soap or rich mottled oldcheese very unctuous and savory withal  You might easily dent itwith your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour  Andthis good friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to anydruggist  Some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidablylost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been securedwere it not for impatient Ahabs loud command to Stubb to desist andcome on board else the ship would bid them good byeCHAPTER 92AmbergrisNow this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important asan article of commerce that in 1791 a certain Nantucketborn CaptainCoffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons onthat subject  For at that time and indeed until a comparativelylate day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amberitself a problem to the learned  Though the word ambergris is butthe French compound for grey amber yet the two substances are quitedistinct  For amber though at times found on the seacoast is alsodug up in some far inland soils whereas ambergris is never foundexcept upon the sea  Besides amber is a hard transparent brittleodorless substance used for mouthpieces to pipes for beads andornaments but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant andspicy that it is largely used in perfumery in pastiles preciouscandles hairpowders and pomatum  The Turks use it in cooking andalso carry it to Mecca for the same purpose that frankincense iscarried to St Peters in Rome  Some wine merchants drop a fewgrains into claret to flavor itWho would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen shouldregale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of asick whale  Yet so it is  By some ambergris is supposed to be thecause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale  Howto cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administeringthree or four boat loads of Brandreths pills and then running outof harms way as laborers do in blasting rocksI have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergriscertain hard round bony plates which at first Stubb thought mightbe sailors trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that theywere nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in thatmannerNow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should befound in the heart of such decay is this nothing  Bethink thee ofthat saying of St Paul in Corinthians about corruption andincorruption how that we are sown in dishonour but raised in gloryAnd likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it isthat maketh the best musk  Also forget not the strange fact that ofall things of illsavor Colognewater in its rudimentalmanufacturing stages is the worstI should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal butcannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made againstwhalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased mindsmight be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been saidof the Frenchmans two whales  Elsewhere in this volume theslanderous aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whalingis throughout a slatternly untidy business  But there is anotherthing to rebut  They hint that all whales always smell bad  Now howdid this odious stigma originateI opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of theGreenland whaling ships in London more than two centuries agoBecause those whalemen did not then and do not now try out theiroil at sea as the Southern ships have always done but cutting up thefresh blubber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes oflarge casks and carry it home in that manner the shortness of theseason in those Icy Seas and the sudden and violent storms to whichthey are exposed forbidding any other course  The consequence isthat upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whalecemeteries in the Greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhatsimilar to that arising from excavating an old city graveyard forthe foundations of a LyinginHospitalI partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may belikewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland informer times of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenbergwhich latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack inhis great work on Smells a textbook on that subject  As its nameimports smeer fat berg to put up this village was founded inorder to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet tobe tried out without being taken home to Holland for that purposeIt was a collection of furnaces fatkettles and oil sheds and whenthe works were in full operation certainly gave forth no verypleasant savor  But all this is quite different with a South SeaSperm Whaler which in a voyage of four years perhaps aftercompletely filling her hold with oil does not perhaps consumefifty days in the business of boiling out and in the state that itis casked the oil is nearly scentless  The truth is that living ordead if but decently treated whales as a species are by no meanscreatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the peopleof the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company by thenose  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrantwhen as a general thing he enjoys such high health takingabundance of exercise always out of doors though it is trueseldom in the open air  I say that the motion of a Sperm Whalesflukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a muskscented ladyrustles her dress in a warm parlor  What then shall I liken theSperm Whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude  Must it notbe to that famous elephant with jewelled tusks and redolent withmyrrh which was led out of an Indian town to do honour to Alexanderthe GreatCHAPTER 93The CastawayIt was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman that amost significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequodscrew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing thesometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and everaccompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove herownNow in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boatsSome few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province it isto work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale  As ageneral thing these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the mencomprising the boats crews  But if there happen to be an undulyslender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certainto be made a shipkeeper  It was so in the Pequod with the littlenegro Pippin by nickname Pip by abbreviation  Poor Pip ye haveheard of him before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramaticmidnight so gloomyjollyIn outer aspect Pip and DoughBoy made a match like a black ponyand a white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colourdriven in one eccentric span  But while hapless DoughBoy was bynature dull and torpid in his intellects Pip though overtenderhearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasantgenial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which everenjoy all holidays and festivities with finer freer relish than anyother race  For blacks the years calendar should show naught butthree hundred and sixtyfive Fourth of Julys and New Years DaysNor smile so while I write that this little black was brilliant foreven blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebonypanelled in kings cabinets  But Pip loved life and all lifespeaceable securities so that the panicstriking business in which hehad somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurredhis brightness though as ere long will be seen what was thustemporarily subdued in him in the end was destined to be luridlyillumined by strange wild fires that fictitiously showed him off toten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland Countyin Connecticut he had once enlivened many a fiddlers frolic on thegreen and at melodious eventide with his gay haha had turned theround horizon into one starbelled tambourine  So though in theclear air of day suspended against a blueveined neck thepurewatered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunningjeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre helays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by thesun but by some unnatural gases  Then come out those fieryeffulgences infernally superb then the evilblazing diamond oncethe divinest symbol of the crystal skies looks like some crownjewelstolen from the King of Hell  But let us to the storyIt came to pass that in the ambergris affair Stubbs afteroarsmanchanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to become quite maimedand temporarily Pip was put into his placeThe first time Stubb lowered with him Pip evinced much nervousnessbut happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale andtherefore came off not altogether discreditably though Stubbobserving him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish hiscourageousness to the utmost for he might often find it needfulNow upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and asthe fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap whichhappened in this instance to be right under poor Pips seat  Theinvoluntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle inhand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slackwhale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard withhim so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into thewater  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run theline swiftly straightened and presto poor Pip came all foaming upto the chocks of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the linewhich had taken several turns around his chest and neckTashtego stood in the bows  He was full of the fire of the hunt  Hehated Pip for a poltroon  Snatching the boatknife from its sheathhe suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards Stubbexclaimed interrogatively Cut  Meantime Pips blue choked faceplainly looked Do for Gods sake  All passed in a flash  In lessthan half a minute this entire thing happenedDamn him cut roared Stubb and so the whale was lost and Pip wassavedSo soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailedby yells and execrations from the crew  Tranquilly permitting theseirregular cursings to evaporate Stubb then in a plainbusinesslike but still half humorous manner cursed Pip officiallyand that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice  Thesubstance was Never jump from a boat Pip exceptbut all the restwas indefinite as the soundest advice ever is  Now in generalSTICK TO THE BOAT is your true motto in whaling but cases willsometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT is still better  Moreoveras if perceiving at last that if he should give undilutedconscientious advice to Pip he would be leaving him too wide amargin to jump in for the future Stubb suddenly dropped all adviceand concluded with a peremptory command Stick to the boat Pip orby the Lord I wont pick you up if you jump mind that  We cantafford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell forthirty times what you would Pip in Alabama  Bear that in mind anddont jump any more  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted thatthough man loved his fellow yet man is a moneymaking animal whichpropensity too often interferes with his benevolenceBut we are all in the hands of the Gods and Pip jumped again  Itwas under very similar circumstances to the first performance butthis time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whalestarted to run Pip was left behind on the sea like a hurriedtravellers trunk  Alas  Stubb was but too true to his word  Itwas a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calm andcool and flatly stretching away all round to the horizon likegoldbeaters skin hammered out to the extremest  Bobbing up anddown in that sea Pips ebon head showed like a head of cloves  Noboatknife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern  Stubbsinexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged  Inthree minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip andStubb  Out from the centre of the sea poor Pip turned his crispcurling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though theloftiest and the brightestNow in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to thepractised swimmer as to ride in a springcarriage ashore  But theawful lonesomeness is intolerable  The intense concentration of selfin the middle of such a heartless immensity my God who can tell itMark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seamarkhow closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sidesBut had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fateNo he did not mean to at least  Because there were two boats inhis wake and he supposed no doubt that they would of course comeup to Pip very quickly and pick him up though indeed suchconsiderations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their owntimidity is not always manifested by the hunters in all similarinstances and such instances not unfrequently occur almostinvariably in the fishery a coward so called is marked with thesame ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armiesBut it so happened that those boats without seeing Pip suddenlyspying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase andStubbs boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intentupon his fish that Pips ringed horizon began to expand around himmiserably  By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued himbut from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiotsuch at least they said he was  The sea had jeeringly kept hisfinite body up but drowned the infinite of his soul  Not drownedentirely though  Rather carried down alive to wondrous depthswhere strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and frobefore his passive eyes and the misermerman Wisdom revealed hishoarded heaps and among the joyous heartless everjuvenileeternities Pip saw the multitudinous Godomnipresent coralinsects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossalorbs  He saw Gods foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke itand therefore his shipmates called him mad  So mans insanity isheavens sense and wandering from all mortal reason man comes atlast to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd andfrantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent ashis GodFor the rest blame not Stubb too hardly  The thing is common inthat fishery and in the sequel of the narrative it will then beseen what like abandonment befell myselfCHAPTER 94A Squeeze of the HandThat whale of Stubbs so dearly purchased was duly brought to thePequods side where all those cutting and hoisting operationspreviously detailed were regularly gone through even to the balingof the Heidelburgh Tun or CaseWhile some were occupied with this latter duty others were employedin dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the spermand when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefullymanipulated ere going to the tryworks of which anonIt had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when withseveral others I sat down before a large Constantines bath of it Ifound it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling aboutin the liquid part  It was our business to squeeze these lumps backinto fluid  A sweet and unctuous duty  No wonder that in old timesthis sperm was such a favourite cosmetic  Such a clearer such asweetener such a softener such a delicious molifier  Afterhaving my hands in it for only a few minutes my fingers felt likeeels and began as it were to serpentine and spiraliseAs I sat there at my ease crosslegged on the deck after the bitterexertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship underindolent sail and gliding so serenely along as I bathed my handsamong those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues wovenalmost within the hour as they richly broke to my fingers anddischarged all their opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine asI snuffed up that uncontaminated aromaliterally and truly likethe smell of spring violets I declare to you that for the time Ilived as in a musky meadow I forgot all about our horrible oath inthat inexpressible sperm I washed my hands and my heart of it Ialmost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm isof rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger while bathing in thatbath I felt divinely free from all illwill or petulance ormalice of any sort whatsoeverSqueeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long I squeezed thatsperm till I myself almost melted into it I squeezed that sperm tilla strange sort of insanity came over me and I found myselfunwittingly squeezing my colaborers hands in it mistaking theirhands for the gentle globules  Such an abounding affectionatefriendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last I wascontinually squeezing their hands and looking up into their eyessentimentally as much as to sayOh my dear fellow beings whyshould we longer cherish any social acerbities or know the slightestillhumor or envy  Come let us squeeze hands all round nay let usall squeeze ourselves into each other let us squeeze ourselvesuniversally into the very milk and sperm of kindnessWould that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever  For nowsince by many prolonged repeated experiences I have perceived thatin all cases man must eventually lower or at least shift hisconceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in theintellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed thetable the saddle the fireside the country now that I haveperceived all this I am ready to squeeze case eternally  Inthoughts of the visions of the night I saw long rows of angels inparadise each with his hands in a jar of spermacetiNow while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other thingsakin to it in the business of preparing the sperm whale for thetryworksFirst comes whitehorse so called which is obtained from thetapering part of the fish and also from the thicker portions of hisflukes  It is tough with congealed tendonsa wad of musclebutstill contains some oil  After being severed from the whale thewhitehorse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to themincer  They look much like blocks of Berkshire marblePlumpudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts ofthe whales flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubberand often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousnessIt is a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold  Asits name imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with abestreaked snowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepestcrimson and purple  It is plums of rubies in pictures of citronSpite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it  Iconfess that once I stole behind the foremast to try it  It tastedsomething as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louisle Gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed thefirst day after the venison season and that particular venisonseason contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyardsof ChampagneThere is another substance and a very singular one which turns upin the course of this business but which I feel it to be verypuzzling adequately to describe  It is called slobgollion anappellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature ofthe substance  It is an ineffably oozy stringy affair mostfrequently found in the tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezingand subsequent decanting  I hold it to be the wondrously thinruptured membranes of the case coalescingGurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen butsometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen  It designatesthe dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of theGreenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of thoseinferior souls who hunt that ignoble LeviathanNippers  Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whalesvocabulary  But as applied by whalemen it becomes so  A whalemansnipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the taperingpart of Leviathans tail it averages an inch in thickness and forthe rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe  Edgewisemoved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee andby nameless blandishments as of magic allures along with it allimpuritiesBut to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is atonce to descend into the blubberroom and have a long talk with itsinmates  This place has previously been mentioned as the receptaclefor the blanketpieces when stript and hoisted from the whale  Whenthe proper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartmentis a scene of terror to all tyros especially by night  On one sidelit by a dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmenThey generally go in pairsa pikeandgaffman and a spademanThe whalingpike is similar to a frigates boardingweapon of thesame name  The gaff is something like a boathook  With his gaffthe gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold itfrom slipping as the ship pitches and lurches about  Meanwhile thespademan stands on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping itinto the portable horsepieces  This spade is sharp as hone can makeit the spademans feet are shoeless the thing he stands on willsometimes irresistibly slide away from him like a sledge  If hecuts off one of his own toes or one of his assistants would you bevery much astonished  Toes are scarce among veteran blubberroommenCHAPTER 95The CassockHad you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of thispostmortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh thewindlass pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no smallcuriosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would haveseen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers  Not thewondrous cistern in the whales huge head not the prodigy of hisunhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none ofthese would so surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountableconelonger than a Kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter atthe base and jetblack as Yojo the ebony idol of Queequeg  And anidol indeed it is or rather in old times its likeness wasSuch an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah inJudea and for worshipping which King Asa her son did depose herand destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abomination at the brookKedron as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book ofKingsLook at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along andassisted by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as themariners call it and with bowed shoulders staggers off with it asif he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the fieldExtending it upon the forecastle deck he now proceeds cylindricallyto remove its dark pelt as an African hunter the pelt of a boaThis done he turns the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg givesit a good stretching so as almost to double its diameter and atlast hangs it well spread in the rigging to dry  Ere long it istaken down when removing some three feet of it towards the pointedextremity and then cutting two slits for armholes at the other endhe lengthwise slips himself bodily into it  The mincer now standsbefore you invested in the full canonicals of his callingImmemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequatelyprotect him while employed in the peculiar functions of his officeThat office consists in mincing the horsepieces of blubber for thepots an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horseplanted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tubbeneath it into which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheetsfrom a rapt orators desk  Arrayed in decent black occupying aconspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves what a candidate for anarchbishopric what a lad for a Pope were this mincerBible leaves  Bible leaves  This is the invariable cry from themates to the mincer  It enjoins him to be careful and cut his workinto as thin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the businessof boiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantityconsiderably increased besides perhaps improving it in qualityCHAPTER 96The TryWorksBesides her hoisted boats an American whaler is outwardlydistinguished by her tryworks  She presents the curious anomaly ofthe most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting thecompleted ship  It is as if from the open field a brickkiln weretransported to her planksThe tryworks are planted between the foremast and mainmast themost roomy part of the deck  The timbers beneath are of a peculiarstrength fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass ofbrick and mortar some ten feet by eight square and five in heightThe foundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmlysecured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on allsides and screwing it down to the timbers  On the flanks it iscased with wood and at top completely covered by a large slopingbattened hatchway  Removing this hatch we expose the great trypotstwo in number and each of several barrels capacity  When not inuse they are kept remarkably clean  Sometimes they are polishedwith soapstone and sand till they shine within like silverpunchbowls  During the nightwatches some cynical old sailors willcrawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap  Whileemployed in polishing themone man in each pot side by sidemanyconfidential communications are carried on over the iron lips  Itis a place also for profound mathematical meditation  It was in theleft hand trypot of the Pequod with the soapstone diligentlycircling round me that I was first indirectly struck by theremarkable fact that in geometry all bodies gliding along thecycloid my soapstone for example will descend from any point inprecisely the same timeRemoving the fireboard from the front of the tryworks the baremasonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths ofthe furnaces directly underneath the pots  These mouths are fittedwith heavy doors of iron  The intense heat of the fire is preventedfrom communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallowreservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the worksBy a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenishedwith water as fast as it evaporates  There are no external chimneysthey open direct from the rear wall  And here let us go back for amomentIt was about nine oclock at night that the Pequods tryworks werefirst started on this present voyage  It belonged to Stubb tooversee the businessAll ready there  Off hatch then and start her  You cook firethe works  This was an easy thing for the carpenter had beenthrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage  Herebe it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the tryworks hasto be fed for a time with wood  After that no wood is used exceptas a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel  In a word afterbeing tried out the crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps orfritters still contains considerable of its unctuous propertiesThese fritters feed the flames  Like a plethoric burning martyr ora selfconsuming misanthrope once ignited the whale supplies hisown fuel and burns by his own body  Would that he consumed his ownsmoke for his smoke is horrible to inhale and inhale it you mustand not only that but you must live in it for the time  It has anunspeakable wild Hindoo odor about it such as may lurk in thevicinity of funereal pyres  It smells like the left wing of the dayof judgment it is an argument for the pitBy midnight the works were in full operation  We were clear from thecarcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild oceandarkness was intense  But that darkness was licked up by the fierceflames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues andilluminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed Greekfire  The burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned tosome vengeful deed  So the pitch and sulphurfreighted brigs of thebold Hydriote Canaris issuing from their midnight harbors withbroad sheets of flame for sails bore down upon the Turkish frigatesand folded them in conflagrationsThe hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a widehearth in front of them  Standing on this were the Tartarean shapesof the pagan harpooneers always the whaleships stokers  With hugepronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into thescalding pots or stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flamesdarted curling out of the doors to catch them by the feet  Thesmoke rolled away in sullen heaps  To every pitch of the ship therewas a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leapinto their faces  Opposite the mouth of the works on the furtherside of the wide wooden hearth was the windlass  This served for aseasofa  Here lounged the watch when not otherwise employedlooking into the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorchedin their heads  Their tawny features now all begrimed with smokeand sweat their matted beards and the contrasting barbaricbrilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in thecapricious emblazonings of the works  As they narrated to each othertheir unholy adventures their tales of terror told in words ofmirth as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them likethe flames from the furnace as to and fro in their front theharpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks anddippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the shipgroaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further andfurther into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfullychamped the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her onall sides then the rushing Pequod freighted with savages and ladenwith fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness ofdarkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniaccommanders soulSo seemed it to me as I stood at her helm and for long hourssilently guided the way of this fireship on the sea  Wrapped forthat interval in darkness myself I but the better saw the rednessthe madness the ghastliness of others  The continual sight of thefiend shapes before me capering half in smoke and half in firethese at last begat kindred visions in my soul so soon as I began toyield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over meat a midnight helmBut that night in particular a strange and ever sinceinexplicable thing occurred to me  Starting from a brief standingsleep I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong  Thejawbone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in my earswas the low hum of sails just beginning to shake in the wind Ithought my eyes were open I was half conscious of putting my fingersto the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apartBut spite of all this I could see no compass before me to steer bythough it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card bythe steady binnacle lamp illuminating it  Nothing seemed before mebut a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by flashes of rednessUppermost was the impression that whatever swift rushing thing Istood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from allhavens astern  A stark bewildered feeling as of death came overme  Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazyconceit that the tiller was somehow in some enchanted wayinverted  My God what is the matter with me thought I  Lo in mybrief sleep I had turned myself about and was fronting the shipsstern with my back to her prow and the compass  In an instant Ifaced back just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up intothe wind and very probably capsizing her  How glad and how gratefulthe relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and thefatal contingency of being brought by the leeLook not too long in the face of the fire O man  Never dream withthy hand on the helm  Turn not thy back to the compass accept thefirst hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial firewhen its redness makes all things look ghastly  Tomorrow in thenatural sun the skies will be bright those who glared like devilsin the forking flames the morn will show in far other at leastgentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only truelampall others but liarsNevertheless the sun hides not Virginias Dismal Swamp nor Romesaccursed Campagna nor wide Sahara nor all the millions of miles ofdeserts and of griefs beneath the moon  The sun hides not the oceanwhich is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of thisearth  So therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy thansorrow in him that mortal man cannot be truenot true orundeveloped  With books the same  The truest of all men was the Manof Sorrows and the truest of all books is Solomons andEcclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe  All is vanityALL  This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomonswisdom yet  But he who dodges hospitals and jails and walks fastcrossing graveyards and would rather talk of operas than hellcalls Cowper Young Pascal Rousseau poor devils all of sick menand throughout a carefree lifetime swears by Rabelais as passingwise and therefore jollynot that man is fitted to sit down ontombstones and break the green damp mould with unfathomablywondrous SolomonBut even Solomon he says the man that wandereth out of the way ofunderstanding shall remain IE even while living in thecongregation of the dead  Give not thyself up then to fire lestit invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me  There is awisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness  And there isa Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into theblackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible inthe sunny spaces  And even if he for ever flies within the gorgethat gorge is in the mountains so that even in his lowest swoop themountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain eventhough they soarCHAPTER 97The LampHad you descended from the Pequods tryworks to the Pequodsforecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one singlemoment you would have almost thought you were standing in someilluminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors  There theylay in their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselledmuteness a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyesIn merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk ofqueens  To dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble indarkness to his pallet this is his usual lot  But the whaleman ashe seeks the food of light so he lives in light  He makes his berthan Aladdins lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchiestnight the ships black hull still houses an illuminationSee with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful oflampsoften but old bottles and vials thoughto the copper coolerat the tryworks and replenishes them there as mugs of ale at avat  He burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufactured andtherefore unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar orastral contrivances ashore  It is sweet as early grass butter inApril  He goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of itsfreshness and genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie huntsup his own supper of gameCHAPTER 98Stowing Down and Clearing UpAlready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar offdescried from the masthead how he is chased over the watery moorsand slaughtered in the valleys of the deep how he is then towedalongside and beheaded and how on the principle which entitled theheadsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed hisgreat padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner how indue time he is condemned to the pots and like Shadrach Meshachand Abednego his spermaceti oil and bone pass unscathed throughthe firebut now it remains to conclude the last chapter of thispart of the description by rehearsingsinging if I maytheromantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks andstriking them down into the hold where once again leviathan returnsto his native profundities sliding along beneath the surface asbefore but alas never more to rise and blowWhile still warm the oil like hot punch is received into thesixbarrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching androlling this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous casks areslewed round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilouslyscoot across the slippery deck like so many land slides till atlast manhandled and stayed in their course and all round the hoopsrap rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now EXOFFICIO every sailor is a cooperAt length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then thegreat hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship are thrown openand down go the casks to their final rest in the sea  This done thehatches are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walledupIn the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkableincidents in all the business of whaling  One day the planks streamwith freshets of blood and oil on the sacred quarterdeck enormousmasses of the whales head are profanely piled great rusty casks lieabout as in a brewery yard the smoke from the tryworks hasbesooted all the bulwarks the mariners go about suffused withunctuousness the entire ship seems great leviathan himself while onall hands the din is deafeningBut a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears inthis selfsame ship and were it not for the telltale boats andtryworks you would all but swear you trod some silent merchantvessel with a most scrupulously neat commander  The unmanufacturedsperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue  This is thereason why the decks never look so white as just after what they callan affair of oil  Besides from the ashes of the burned scraps ofthe whale a potent lye is readily made and whenever anyadhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the sidethat lye quickly exterminates it  Hands go diligently along thebulwarks and with buckets of water and rags restore them to theirfull tidiness  The soot is brushed from the lower rigging  All thenumerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfullycleansed and put away  The great hatch is scrubbed and placed uponthe tryworks completely hiding the pots every cask is out ofsight all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks and when by thecombined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire shipscompany the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concludedthen the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions shiftthemselves from top to toe and finally issue to the immaculate deckfresh and all aglow as bridegrooms newleaped from out the daintiestHollandNow with elated step they pace the planks in twos and threes andhumorously discourse of parlors sofas carpets and fine cambricspropose to mat the deck think of having hanging to the top objectnot to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle  Tohint to such musked mariners of oil and bone and blubber werelittle short of audacity  They know not the thing you distantlyallude to  Away and bring us napkinsBut mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three menintent on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly willagain soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one smallgreasespot somewhere  Yes and many is the time when after theseverest uninterrupted labors which know no night continuingstraight through for ninetysix hours when from the boat where theyhave swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Linethey onlystep to the deck to carry vast chains and heave the heavy windlassand cut and slash yea and in their very sweatings to be smoked andburned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and theequatorial tryworks when on the heel of all this they havefinally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship and make a spotlessdairy room of it many is the time the poor fellows just buttoningthe necks of their clean frocks are startled by the cry of Thereshe blows and away they fly to fight another whale and go throughthe whole weary thing again  Oh my friends but this ismankilling  Yet this is life  For hardly have we mortals by longtoilings extracted from this worlds vast bulk its small butvaluable sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselvesfrom its defilements and learned to live here in clean tabernaclesof the soul hardly is this done whenTHERE SHE BLOWSthe ghostis spouted up and away we sail to fight some other world and gothrough young lifes old routine againOh the metempsychosis  Oh  Pythagoras that in bright Greece twothousand years ago did die so good so wise so mild I sailed withthee along the Peruvian coast last voyageand foolish as I amtaught thee a green simple boy how to splice a ropeCHAPTER 99The DoubloonEre now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace hisquarterdeck taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle andmainmast but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narrationit has not been added how that sometimes in these walks when mostplunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot andstand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him  Whenhe halted before the binnacle with his glance fastened on thepointed needle in the compass that glance shot like a javelin withthe pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walk heagain paused before the mainmast then as the same riveted glancefastened upon the riveted gold coin there he still wore the sameaspect of nailed firmness only dashed with a certain wild longingif not hopefulnessBut one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newlyattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it asthough now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself insome monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them  Andsome certain significance lurks in all things else all things arelittle worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher exceptto sell by the cartload as they do hills about Boston to fill upsome morass in the Milky WayNow this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out ofthe heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over goldensands the headwaters of many a Pactolus flows  And though nownailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris ofcopper spikes yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness itstill preserved its Quito glow  Nor though placed amongst aruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands and throughthe livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might coverany pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloonwhere the sunset left it last  For it was set apart and sanctifiedto one awestriking end and however wanton in their sailor ways oneand all the mariners revered it as the white whales talismanSometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wonderingwhose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to spenditNow those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of thesun and tropic tokenpieces  Here palms alpacas and volcanoessuns disks and stars ecliptics hornsofplenty and rich bannerswaving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious goldseems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing gloriesby passing through those fancy mints so Spanishly poeticIt so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthyexample of these things  On its round border it bore the lettersREPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR QUITO  So this bright coin came from acountry planted in the middle of the world and beneath the greatequator and named after it and it had been cast midway up theAndes in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn  Zoned by thoseletters you saw the likeness of three Andes summits from one aflame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while archingover all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac the signs allmarked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun enteringthe equinoctial point at LibraBefore this equatorial coin Ahab not unobserved by others was nowpausingTheres something ever egotistical in mountaintops and towers andall other grand and lofty things look herethree peaks as proud asLucifer  The firm tower that is Ahab the volcano that is Ahabthe courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too isAhab all are Ahab and this round gold is but the image of therounder globe which like a magicians glass to each and every manin turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self  Great pains smallgains for those who ask the world to solve them it cannot solveitself  Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face but seeaye he enters the sign of storms the equinox and but six monthsbefore he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries  From storm tostorm  So be it then  Born in throes t is fit that man shouldlive in pains and die in pangs  So be it then  Heres stout stufffor woe to work on  So be it thenNo fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devils claws must haveleft their mouldings there since yesterday murmured Starbuck tohimself leaning against the bulwarks  The old man seems to readBelshazzars awful writing  I have never marked the coininspectingly  He goes below let me read  A dark valley betweenthree mighty heavenabiding peaks that almost seem the Trinity insome faint earthly symbol  So in this vale of Death God girds usround and over all our gloom the sun of Righteousness still shinesa beacon and a hope  If we bend down our eyes the dark vale showsher mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glancehalf way to cheer  Yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if atmidnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him we gazefor him in vain  This coin speaks wisely mildly truly but stillsadly to me  I will quit it lest Truth shake me falselyThere nows the old Mogul soliloquized Stubb by the tryworkshes been twigging it and there goes Starbuck from the same andboth with faces which I should say might be somewhere within ninefathoms long  And all from looking at a piece of gold which did Ihave it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaers Hook Id not look at itvery long ere spending it  Humph in my poor insignificant opinionI regard this as queer  I have seen doubloons before now in myvoyagings your doubloons of old Spain your doubloons of Peru yourdoubloons of Chili your doubloons of Bolivia your doubloons ofPopayan with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles and joes andhalf joes and quarter joes  What then should there be in thisdoubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful  By Golcondalet me read it once  Halloa heres signs and wonders truly  Thatnow

Pequod of Nantucket Meets the Samuel Enderby of LondonShip ahoy  Hast seen the White WhaleSo cried Ahab once more hailing a ship showing English coloursbearing down under the stern  Trumpet to mouth the old man wasstanding in his hoisted quarterboat his ivory leg plainly revealedto the stranger captain who was carelessly reclining in his ownboats bow  He was a darklytanned burly goodnaturedfinelooking man of sixty or thereabouts dressed in a spaciousroundabout that hung round him in festoons of blue pilotcloth andone empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broideredarm of a hussars surcoatHast seen the White WhaleSee you this and withdrawing it from the folds that had hiddenit he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone terminating in awooden head like a malletMan my boat cried Ahab impetuously and tossing about the oarsnear himStand by to lowerIn less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and hiscrew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of thestranger  But here a curious difficulty presented itself  In theexcitement of the moment Ahab had forgotten that since the loss ofhis leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea buthis own and then it was always by an ingenious and very handymechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod and a thing not to berigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moments warning  Nowit is no very easy matter for anybodyexcept those who are almosthourly used to it like whalemento clamber up a ships side from aboat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high uptowards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way downto the kelson  So deprived of one leg and the strange ship ofcourse being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention Ahabnow found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman againhopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hopeto attainIt has before been hinted perhaps that every little untowardcircumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from hisluckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated AhabAnd in the present instance all this was heightened by the sight ofthe two officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by theperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards hima pair of tastefullyornamented manropes for at first they did notseem to bethink them that a onelegged man must be too much of acripple to use their sea bannisters  But this awkwardness onlylasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glancehow affairs stood cried out I see I seeavast heaving thereJump boys and swing over the cuttingtackleAs good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day ortwo previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massivecurved blubberhook now clean and dry was still attached to theend  This was quickly lowered to Ahab who at once comprehending itall slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was likesitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple treeand then giving the word held himself fast and at the same timealso helped to hoist his own weight by pulling handoverhand uponone of the running parts of the tackle  Soon he was carefully swunginside the high bulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan headWith his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captainadvanced and Ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivoryarm like two swordfish blades cried out in his walrus way Ayeaye hearty let us shake bones togetheran arm and a legan armthat never can shrink dye see and a leg that never can run  Wheredidst thou see the White Whalehow long agoThe White Whale said the Englishman pointing his ivory armtowards the East and taking a rueful sight along it as if it hadbeen a telescope there I saw him on the Line last seasonAnd he took that arm off did he asked Ahab now sliding down fromthe capstan and resting on the Englishmans shoulder as he did soAye he was the cause of it at least and that leg tooSpin me the yarn said Ahab how was itIt was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Linebegan the Englishman  I was ignorant of the White Whale at thattime  Well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales andmy boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was toothat went milling and milling round so that my boats crew couldonly trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwalePresently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing greatwhale with a milkywhite head and hump all crows feet andwrinklesIt was he it was he cried Ahab suddenly letting out hissuspended breathAnd harpoons sticking in near his starboard finAye ayethey were mineMY irons cried Ahab exultinglybutonGive me a chance then said the Englishman goodhumoredlyWell this old greatgrandfather with the white head and hump runsall afoam into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at myfastlineAye I seewanted to part it free the fastfishan old trickIknow himHow it was exactly continued the onearmed commander I do notknow but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught theresomehow but we didnt know it then so that when we afterwardspulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead ofthe other whales that went off to windward all fluking  Seeinghow matters stood and what a noble great whale it wasthe noblestand biggest I ever saw sir in my lifeI resolved to capture himspite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in  And thinking thehaphazard line would get loose or the tooth it was tangled tomight draw for I have a devil of a boats crew for a pull on awhaleline seeing all this I say I jumped into my first matesboatMr Mounttops here by the way CaptainMounttopMounttopthe captainas I was saying I jumped into Mounttopsboat which dye see was gunwale and gunwale with mine then andsnatching the first harpoon let this old greatgrandfather have itBut Lord look you sirhearts and souls alive manthe nextinstant in a jiff I was blind as a batboth eyes outall befoggedand bedeadened with black foamthe whales tail looming straight upout of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple  No usesterning all then but as I was groping at midday with a blindingsun all crownjewels as I was groping I say after the secondiron to toss it overboarddown comes the tail like a Lima towercutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and flukesfirst the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was allchips  We all struck out  To escape his terrible flailings Iseized hold of my harpoonpole sticking in him and for a momentclung to that like a sucking fish  But a combing sea dashed me offand at the same instant the fish taking one good dart forwardswent down like a flash and the barb of that cursed second irontowing along near me caught me here clapping his hand just belowhis shoulder yes caught me just here I say and bore me down toHells flames I was thinking when when all of a sudden thank thegood God the barb ript its way along the fleshclear along thewhole length of my armcame out nigh my wrist and up Ifloatedand that gentleman there will tell you the rest by theway captainDr Bunger ships surgeon Bunger my ladthecaptain  Now Bunger boy spin your part of the yarnThe professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been allthe time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denotehis gentlemanly rank on board  His face was an exceedingly round butsober one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt andpatched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attentionbetween a marlingspike he held in one hand and a pillbox held inthe other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbsof the two crippled captains  But at his superiors introduction ofhim to Ahab he politely bowed and straightway went on to do hiscaptains biddingIt was a shocking bad wound began the whalesurgeon and takingmy advice Captain Boomer here stood our old SammySamuel Enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the onearmedcaptain addressing Ahab go on boyStood our old Sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazinghot weather there on the Line  But it was no useI did all I couldsat up with him nights was very severe with him in the matter ofdietOh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenlyaltering his voice Drinking hot rum toddies with me every nighttill he couldnt see to put on the bandages and sending me to bedhalf seas over about three oclock in the morning  Oh ye stars hesat up with me indeed and was very severe in my diet  Oh a greatwatcher and very dietetically severe is Dr Bunger Bunger youdog laugh out why dont ye  You know youre a precious jollyrascal But heave ahead boy Id rather be killed by you than keptalive by any other manMy captain you must have ere this perceived respected sirsaidthe imperturbable godlylooking Bunger slightly bowing to Ahabisapt to be facetious at times he spins us many clever things of thatsort  But I may as well sayen passant as the French remarkthatI myselfthat is to say Jack Bunger late of the reverendclergyam a strict total abstinence man I never drinkWater cried the captain he never drinks it its a sort of fitsto him fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia but go ongo onwith the arm storyYes I may as well said the surgeon coolly  I was aboutobserving sir before Captain Boomers facetious interruption thatspite of my best and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worseand worse the truth was sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeonever saw more than two feet and several inches long  I measured itwith the lead line  In short it grew black I knew what wasthreatened and off it came  But I had no hand in shipping thativory arm there that thing is against all rulepointing at it withthe marlingspikethat is the captains work not mine he orderedthe carpenter to make it he had that clubhammer there put to theend to knock some ones brains out with I suppose as he tried mineonce  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes  Do ye see thisdent sirremoving his hat and brushing aside his hair andexposing a bowllike cavity in his skull but which bore not theslightest scarry trace or any token of ever having been awoundWell the captain there will tell you how that came herehe knowsNo I dont said the captain but his mother did he was bornwith it  Oh you solemn rogue youyou Bunger was there ever suchanother Bunger in the watery world  Bunger when you die you oughtto die in pickle you dog you should be preserved to future agesyou rascalWhat became of the White Whale now cried Ahab who thus far hadbeen impatiently listening to this byplay between the twoEnglishmenOh cried the onearmed captain oh yes  Well after he soundedwe didnt see him again for some time in fact as I before hinted Ididnt then know what whale it was that had served me such a tricktill some time afterwards when coming back to the Line we heardabout Moby Dickas some call himand then I knew it was heDidst thou cross his wake againTwiceBut could not fastenDidnt want to try to aint one limb enough  What should I dowithout this other arm  And Im thinking Moby Dick doesnt bite somuch as he swallowsWell then interrupted Bunger give him your left arm for bait toget the right  Do you know gentlemenvery gravely andmathematically bowing to each Captain in successionDo you knowgentlemen that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutablyconstructed by Divine Providence that it is quite impossible for himto completely digest even a mans arm  And he knows it too  So thatwhat you take for the White Whales malice is only his awkwardnessFor he never means to swallow a single limb he only thinks toterrify by feints  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellowformerly a patient of mine in Ceylon that making believe swallowjackknives once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnestand there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more when I gave him anemetic and he heaved it up in small tacks dye see  No possibleway for him to digest that jackknife and fully incorporate it intohis general bodily system  Yes Captain Boomer if you are quickenough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of

named after the late Samuel Enderbymerchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house ofEnderby  Sons a house which in my poor whalemans opinion comesnot far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons inpoint of real historical interest  How long prior to the year ofour Lord 1775 this great whaling house was in existence my numerousfishdocuments do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fittedout the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the SpermWhale though for some score of years previous ever since 1726 ourvaliant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in largefleets pursued that Leviathan but only in the North and SouthAtlantic not elsewhere  Be it distinctly recorded here that theNantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilizedsteel the great Sperm Whale and that for half a century they werethe only people of the whole globe who so harpooned himIn 1778 a fine ship the Amelia fitted out for the express purposeand at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys boldly rounded CapeHorn and was the first among the nations to lower a whaleboat ofany sort in the great South Sea  The voyage was a skilful and luckyone and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precioussperm the Amelias example was soon followed by other ships Englishand American and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacificwere thrown open  But not content with this good deed theindefatigable house again bestirred itself Samuel and all hisSonshow many their mother only knowsand under their immediateauspices and partly I think at their expense the Britishgovernment was induced to send the sloopofwar Rattler on a whalingvoyage of discovery into the South Sea  Commanded by a navalPostCaptain the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did someservice how much does not appear  But this is not all  In 1819the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to goon a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan  That shipwellcalled the Syrenmade a noble experimental cruise and it was thusthat the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally knownThe Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin aNantucketerAll honour to the Enderbies therefore whose house I think existsto the present day though doubtless the original Samuel must longago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the otherworldThe ship named after him was worthy of the honour being a very fastsailer and a noble craft every way  I boarded her once at midnightsomewhere off the Patagonian coast and drank good flip down in theforecastle  It was a fine gam we had and they were alltrumpsevery soul on board  A short life to them and a jollydeath  And that fine gam I hadlong very long after old Ahabtouched her planks with his ivory heelit minds me of the noblesolid Saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget meand the devil remember me if I ever lose sight of it  Flip  Did Isay we had flip  Yes and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallonsthe hour and when the squall came for its squally off there byPatagonia and all handsvisitors and allwere called to reeftopsails we were so topheavy that we had to swing each other aloftin bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets intothe sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling gale awarning example to all drunken tars  However the masts did not gooverboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had topass the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down theforecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to mytasteThe beef was finetough but with body in it  They said it wasbullbeef others that it was dromedary beef but I do not know forcertain how that was  They had dumplings too small butsubstantial symmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings  Ifancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you afterthey were swallowed  If you stooped over too far forward you riskedtheir pitching out of you like billiardballs  The breadbut thatcouldnt be helped besides it was an antiscorbutic in short thebread contained the only fresh fare they had  But the forecastle wasnot very light and it was very easy to step over into a dark cornerwhen you ate it  But all in all taking her from truck to helmconsidering the dimensions of the cooks boilers including his ownlive parchment boilers fore and aft I say the Samuel Enderby was ajolly ship of good fare and plenty fine flip and strong crackfellows all and capital from boot heels to hatbandBut why was it think ye that the Samuel Enderby and some otherEnglish whalers I know ofnot all thoughwere such famoushospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and thecan and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinkingand laughing  I will tell you  The abounding good cheer of theseEnglish whalers is matter for historical research  Nor have I beenat all sparing of historical whale research when it has seemedneededThe English were preceded in the whale fishery by the HollandersZealanders and Danes from whom they derived many terms still extantin the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashionstouching plenty to eat and drink  For as a general thing theEnglish merchantship scrimps her crew but not so the Englishwhaler  Hence in the English this thing of whaling good cheer isnot normal and natural but incidental and particular andtherefore must have some special origin which is here pointed outand will be still further elucidatedDuring my researches in the Leviathanic histories I stumbled upon anancient Dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it I knewmust be about whalers  The title was Dan Coopman wherefore Iconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdamcooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper  Iwas reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the productionof one Fitz Swackhammer  But my friend Dr Snodhead a verylearned man professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college ofSanta Claus and St Potts to whom I handed the work fortranslation giving him a box of sperm candles for his troublethissame Dr Snodhead so soon as he spied the book assured me that DanCoopman did not mean The Cooper but The Merchant  In shortthis ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce ofHolland and among other subjects contained a very interestingaccount of its whale fishery  And in this chapter it was headedSmeer or Fat that I found a long detailed list of the outfitsfor the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen from whichlist as translated by Dr Snodhead I transcribe the following400000 lbs of beef60000 lbs Friesland pork150000 lbs of stock fish550000 lbs of biscuit72000 lbs of soft bread2800 firkins of butter20000 lbs Texel  Leyden cheese144000 lbs cheese probably an inferior article550 ankers of Geneva10800 barrels of beerMost statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so inthe present case however where the reader is flooded with wholepipes barrels quarts and gills of good gin and good cheerAt the time I devoted three days to the studious digesting of allthis beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts wereincidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental andPlatonic application and furthermore I compiled supplementarytables of my own touching the probable quantity of stockfish etcconsumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland andSpitzbergen whale fishery  In the first place the amount of butterand Texel and Leyden cheese consumed seems amazing  I impute itthough to their naturally unctuous natures being rendered stillmore unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially bytheir pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas on the verycoasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledgeeach other in bumpers of train oilThe quantity of beer too is very large 10800 barrels  Nowas those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summerof that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutchwhalemen including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen seadid not much exceed three months say and reckoning 30 men to eachof their fleet of 180 sail we have 5400 Low Dutch seamen in alltherefore I say we have precisely two barrels of beer per man fora twelve weeks allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that550 ankers of gin  Now whether these gin and beer harpooneers sofuddled as one might fancy them to have been were the right sort ofmen to stand up in a boats head and take good aim at flying whalesthis would seem somewhat improbable  Yet they did aim at them andhit them too  But this was very far North be it remembered wherebeer agrees well with the constitution upon the Equator in oursouthern fishery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy atthe masthead and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue toNantucket and New BedfordBut no more enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalersof two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the Englishwhalers have not neglected so excellent an example  For say theywhen cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out ofthe world get a good dinner out of it at least  And this emptiesthe decanterCHAPTER 102A Bower in the ArsacidesHitherto in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale I havechiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately andin detail upon some few interior structural features  But to a largeand thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now tounbutton him still further and untagging the points of his hoseunbuckling his garters and casting loose the hooks and the eyes ofthe joints of his innermost bones set him before you in hisultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeletonBut how now Ishmael  How is it that you a mere oarsman in thefishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of thewhale  Did erudite Stubb mounted upon your capstan deliverlectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea and by help of the windlasshold up a specimen rib for exhibition  Explain thyself IshmaelCan you land a fullgrown whale on your deck for examination as acook dishes a roastpig  Surely not  A veritable witness have youhitherto been Ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilegeof Jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists andbeams the rafters ridgepole sleepers and underpinnings makingup the framework of leviathan and belike of the tallowvatsdairyrooms butteries and cheeseries in his bowelsI confess that since Jonah few whalemen have penetrated very farbeneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless I have beenblessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature  In a ship Ibelonged to a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to thedeck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of theharpoons and for the heads of the lances  Think you I let thatchance go without using my boathatchet and jackknife and breakingthe seal and reading all the contents of that young cubAnd as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in theirgigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge I amindebted to my late royal friend Tranquo king of Tranque one ofthe Arsacides  For being at Tranque years ago when attached to thetradingship Dey of Algiers I was invited to spend part of theArsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque at his retired palmvilla at Pupella a seaside glen not very far distant from what oursailors called BambooTown his capitalAmong many other fine qualities my royal friend Tranquo beinggifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu hadbrought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingeniousof his people could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderfuldevices chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromaticcanoes and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders thewonderfreighted tributerendering waves had cast upon his shoresChief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale which after anunusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded withhis head against a cocoanut tree whose plumagelike tufteddroopings seemed his verdant jet  When the vast body had at lastbeen stripped of its fathomdeep enfoldings and the bones becomedust dry in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported upthe Pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltereditThe ribs were hung with trophies the vertebrae were carved withArsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull thepriests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystichead again sent forth its vapoury spout while suspended from abough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees likethe hairhung sword that so affrighted DamoclesIt was a wondrous sight  The wood was green as mosses of the IcyGlen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap theindustrious earth beneath was as a weavers loom with a gorgeouscarpet on it whereof the groundvine tendrils formed the warp andwoof and the living flowers the figures  All the trees with alltheir laden branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses themessagecarrying air all these unceasingly were active  Through thelacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weavingthe unwearied verdure  Oh busy weaver unseen weaverpauseonewordwhither flows the fabric what palace may it deck whereforeall these ceaseless toilings  Speak weaverstay thy handbutone single word with thee  Naythe shuttle fliesthe figures floatfrom forth the loom the freshetrushing carpet for ever slidesaway  The weavergod he weaves and by that weaving is he deafenedthat he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who lookon the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hearthe thousand voices that speak through it  For even so it is in allmaterial factories  The spoken words that are inaudible among theflying spindles those same words are plainly heard without thewalls bursting from the opened casements  Thereby have villainiesbeen detected  Ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this dinof the great worlds loom thy subtlest thinkings may be overheardafarNow amid the green liferestless loom of that Arsacidean wood thegreat white worshipped skeleton lay lounginga gigantic idlerYet as the everwoven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummedaround him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself allwoven over with the vines every month assuming greener fresherverdure but himself a skeleton  Life folded Death Death trellisedLife the grim god wived with youthful Life and begat himcurlyheaded gloriesNow when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale and sawthe skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where thereal jet had issued I marvelled that the king should regard a chapelas an object of vertu  He laughed  But more I marvelled that thepriests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine  To and fro Ipaced before this skeletonbrushed the vines asidebroke throughthe ribsand with a ball of Arsacidean twine wandered eddied longamid its many winding shaded colonnades and arbours  But soon myline was out and following it back I emerged from the opening where Ientered  I saw no living thing within naught was there but bonesCutting me a green measuringrod I once more dived within theskeleton  From their arrowslit in the skull the priests perceivedme taking the altitude of the final rib How now they shoutedDarst thou measure this our god  Thats for us  Ayepriestswell how long do ye make him then  But hereupon a fiercecontest rose among them concerning feet and inches they crackedeach others sconces with their yardsticksthe great skullechoedand seizing that lucky chance I quickly concluded my ownadmeasurementsThese admeasurements I now propose to set before you  But first beit recorded that in this matter I am not free to utter any fanciedmeasurement I please  Because there are skeleton authorities youcan refer to to test my accuracy  There is a Leviathanic Museumthey tell me in Hull England one of the whaling ports of thatcountry where they have some fine specimens of finbacks and otherwhales  Likewise I have heard that in the museum of Manchester inNew Hampshire they have what the proprietors call the only perfectspecimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United StatesMoreover at a place in Yorkshire England Burton Constable by namea certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeletonof a Sperm Whale but of moderate size by no means of the fullgrownmagnitude of my friend King TranquosIn both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletonsbelonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similargrounds  King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and SirClifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts  SirCliffords whale has been articulated throughout so that like agreat chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bonycavitiesspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanand swing all dayupon his lower jaw  Locks are to be put upon some of his trapdoorsand shutters and a footman will show round future visitors with abunch of keys at his side  Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopencefor a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepenceto hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence forthe unrivalled view from his foreheadThe skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copiedverbatim from my right arm where I had them tattooed as in my wildwanderings at that period there was no other secure way ofpreserving such valuable statistics  But as I was crowded for spaceand wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for apoem I was then composingat least what untattooed parts mightremainI did not trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeedshould inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of thewhaleCHAPTER 103Measurement of The Whales SkeletonIn the first place I wish to lay before you a particular plainstatement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeletonwe are briefly to exhibit  Such a statement may prove useful hereAccording to a careful calculation I have made and which I partlybase upon Captain Scoresbys estimate of seventy tons for thelargest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length according tomy careful calculation I say a Sperm Whale of the largestmagnitude between eightyfive and ninety feet in length andsomething less than forty feet in its fullest circumference such awhale will weigh at least ninety tons so that reckoning thirteenmen to a ton he would considerably outweigh the combined populationof a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitantsThink you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put tothis leviathan to make him at all budge to any landsmansimaginationHaving already in various ways put before you his skull spoutholejaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts I shall nowsimply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of hisunobstructed bones  But as the colossal skull embraces so very largea proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by farthe most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeatedconcerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in yourmind or under your arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain acomplete notion of the general structure we are about to viewIn length the Sperm Whales skeleton at Tranque measured seventytwoFeet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must havebeen ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about onefifth in length compared with the living body  Of this seventytwofeet his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving somefifty feet of plain backbone  Attached to this backbone forsomething less than a third of its length was the mighty circularbasket of ribs which once enclosed his vitalsTo me this vast ivoryribbed chest with the long unrelieved spineextending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembledthe hull of a great ship newlaid upon the stocks when only sometwenty of her naked bowribs are inserted and the keel is otherwisefor the time but a long disconnected timberThe ribs were ten on a side  The first to begin from the neck wasnearly six feet long the second third and fourth were eachsuccessively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or oneof the middle ribs which measured eight feet and some inches  Fromthat part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and lastonly spanned five feet and some inches  In general thickness theyall bore a seemly correspondence to their length  The middle ribswere the most arched  In some of the Arsacides they are used forbeams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streamsIn considering these ribs I could not but be struck anew with thecircumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeletonof the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form  Thelargest of the Tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied thatpart of the fish which in life is greatest in depth  Now thegreatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale musthave been at least sixteen feet whereas the corresponding ribmeasured but little more than eight feet  So that this rib onlyconveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of thatpart  Besides for some way where I now saw but a naked spine allthat had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in fleshmuscle blood and bowels  Still more for the ample fins I heresaw but a few disordered joints and in place of the weighty andmajestic but boneless flukes an utter blankHow vain and foolish then thought I for timid untravelled man totry to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring overhis dead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood  NoOnly in the heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyingsof his angry flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can thefully invested whale be truly and livingly found outBut the spine  For that the best way we can consider it is with acrane to pile its bones high up on end  No speedy enterprise  Butnow its done it looks much like Pompeys PillarThere are forty and odd vertebrae in all which in the skeleton arenot locked together  They mostly lie like the great knobbed blockson a Gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry  Thelargest a middle one is in width something less than three feetand in depth more than four  The smallest where the spine tapersaway into the tail is only two inches in width and looks somethinglike a white billiardball  I was told that there were still smallerones but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins thepriests children who had stolen them to play marbles with  Thus wesee how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers offat last into simple childs playCHAPTER 104The Fossil WhaleFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereonto enlarge amplify and generally expatiate  Would you you couldnot compress him  By good rights he should only be treated of inimperial folio  Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle totail and the yards he measures about the waist only think of thegigantic involutions of his intestines where they lie in him likegreat cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlopdeckof a lineofbattleshipSince I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan it behooves meto approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise notoverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning himout to the uttermost coil of his bowels  Having already describedhim in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiaritiesit now remains to magnify him in an archaeological fossiliferousand antediluvian point of view  Applied to any other creature thanthe Leviathanto an ant or a fleasuch portly terms might justly bedeemed unwarrantably grandiloquent  But when Leviathan is the textthe case is altered  Fain am I to stagger to this emprise underthe weightiest words of the dictionary  And here be it said thatwhenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of thesedissertations I have invariably used a huge quarto edition ofJohnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famouslexicographers uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile alexicon to be used by a whale author like meOne often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subjectthough it may seem but an ordinary one  How then with me writingof this Leviathan  Unconsciously my chirography expands into placardcapitals  Give me a condors quill  Give me Vesuvius crater for aninkstand  Friends hold my arms  For in the mere act of penning mythoughts of this Leviathan they weary me and make me faint withtheir outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include thewhole circle of the sciences and all the generations of whales andmen and mastodons past present and to come with all therevolving panoramas of empire on earth and throughout the wholeuniverse not excluding its suburbs  Such and so magnifying is thevirtue of a large and liberal theme  We expand to its bulk  Toproduce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme  No great andenduring volume can ever be written on the flea though many there bewho have tried itEre entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales I present mycredentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous timeI have been a stonemason and also a great digger of ditchescanals and wells winevaults cellars and cisterns of all sortsLikewise by way of preliminary I desire to remind the reader thatwhile in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils ofmonsters now almost completely extinct the subsequent relicsdiscovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem theconnecting or at any rate intercepted links between theantichronical creatures and those whose remote posterity are said tohave entered the Ark all the Fossil Whales hitherto discoveredbelong to the Tertiary period which is the last preceding thesuperficial formations  And though none of them precisely answer toany known species of the present time they are yet sufficiently akinto them in general respects to justify their taking rank asCetacean fossilsDetached broken fossils of preadamite whales fragments of theirbones and skeletons have within thirty years past at variousintervals been found at the base of the Alps in Lombardy inFrance in England in Scotland and in the States of LouisianaMississippi and Alabama  Among the more curious of such remains ispart of a skull which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the RueDauphine in Paris a short street opening almost directly upon thepalace of the Tuileries and bones disinterred in excavating thegreat docks of Antwerp in Napoleons time  Cuvier pronounced thesefragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown LeviathanicspeciesBut by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almostcomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year 1842on the plantation of Judge Creagh in Alabama  The awestrickencredulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of thefallen angels  The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile andbestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus  But some specimen bonesof it being taken across the sea to Owen the English Anatomist itturned out that this alleged reptile was a whale though of adeparted species  A significant illustration of the fact again andagain repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishesbut little clue to the shape of his fully invested body  So Owenrechristened the monster Zeuglodon and in his paper read before theLondon Geological Society pronounced it in substance one of themost extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe haveblotted out of existenceWhen I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons skulls tusksjaws ribs and vertebrae all characterized by partial resemblancesto the existing breeds of seamonsters but at the same time bearingon the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronicalLeviathans their incalculable seniors I am by a flood borne backto that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begunfor time began with man  Here Saturns grey chaos rolls over me andI obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities whenwedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropicsand in all the 25000 miles of this worlds circumference not aninhabitable hands breadth of land was visible  Then the whole worldwas the whales and king of creation he left his wake along thepresent lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs  Who can show apedigree like Leviathan  Ahabs harpoon had shed older blood thanthe Pharaohs  Methuselah seems a schoolboy  I look round to shakehands with Shem  I am horrorstruck at this antemosaic unsourcedexistence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale which having beenbefore all time must needs exist after all humane ages are overBut not alone has this Leviathan left his preadamite traces in thestereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed hisancient bust but upon Egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems toclaim for them an almost fossiliferous character we find theunmistakable print of his fin  In an apartment of the great templeof Denderah some fifty years ago there was discovered upon thegranite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere abounding incentaurs griffins and dolphins similar to the grotesque figureson the celestial globe of the moderns  Gliding among them oldLeviathan swam as of yore was there swimming in that planispherecenturies before Solomon was cradledNor must there be omitted another strange attestation of theantiquity of the whale in his own osseous postdiluvian reality asset down by the venerable John Leo the old Barbary travellerNot far from the Seaside they have a Temple the Rafters and Beamsof which are made of WhaleBones for Whales of a monstrous size areoftentimes cast up dead upon that shore  The Common People imaginethat by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple no Whale canpass it without immediate death  But the truth of the Matter isthat on either side of the Temple there are Rocks that shoot twoMiles into the Sea and wound the Whales when they light upon emThey keep a Whales Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle whichlying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost makes an Archthe Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camels BackThis Rib says John Leo is said to have layn there a hundred Yearsbefore I saw it  Their Historians affirm that a Prophet whoprophesyd of Mahomet came from this Temple and some do not standto assert that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at theBase of the TempleIn this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you reader and if you bea Nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship thereCHAPTER 105Does the Whales Magnitude DiminishWill He PerishInasmuch then as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us fromthe headwaters of the Eternities it may be fitly inquired whetherin the long course of his generations he has not degenerated fromthe original bulk of his siresBut upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of thepresent day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains arefound in the Tertiary system embracing a distinct geological periodprior to man but of the whales found in that Tertiary system thosebelonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of itsearlier onesOf all the preadamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is theAlabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less thanseventy feet in length in the skeleton  Whereas we have alreadyseen that the tapemeasure gives seventytwo feet for the skeletonof a large sized modern whale  And I have heard on whalemensauthority that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feetlong at the time of captureBut may it not be that while the whales of the present hour are anadvance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periodsmay it not be that since Adams time they have degeneratedAssuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts ofsuch gentlemen as Pliny and the ancient naturalists generally  ForPliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk andAldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet inlengthRope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales  And even in thedays of Banks and Solander Cookes naturalists we find a Danishmember of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whalesreydansiskur or Wrinkled Bellies at one hundred and twenty yardsthat is three hundred and sixty feet  And Lacepede the Frenchnaturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginningof his work page 3 sets down the Right Whale at one hundredmetres three hundred and twentyeight feet  And this work waspublished so late as AD 1825But will any whaleman believe these stories  No  The whale oftoday is as big as his ancestors in Plinys time  And if ever I gowhere Pliny is I a whaleman more than he was will make bold totell him so  Because I cannot understand how it is that while theEgyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before evenPliny was born do not measure so much in their coffins as a modernKentuckian in his socks and while the cattle and other animalssculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets by therelative proportions in which they are drawn just as plainly provethat the highbred stallfed prize cattle of Smithfield not onlyequal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaohs fat kinein the face of all this I will not admit that of all animals thewhale alone should have degeneratedBut still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the morerecondite Nantucketers  Whether owing to the almost omniscientlookouts at the mastheads of the whaleships now penetrating eventhrough Behrings straits and into the remotest secret drawers andlockers of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances dartedalong all continental coasts the moot point is whether Leviathancan long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whetherhe must not at last be exterminated from the waters and the lastwhale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then himselfevaporate in the final puffComparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds ofbuffalo which not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousandsthe prairies of Illinois and Missouri and shook their iron manes andscowled with their thunderclotted brows upon the sites of populousrivercapitals where now the polite broker sells you land at adollar an inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument wouldseem furnished to show that the hunted whale cannot now escapespeedy extinctionBut you must look at this matter in every light  Though so short aperiod agonot a good lifetimethe census of the buffalo inIllinois exceeded the census of men now in London and though at thepresent day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that regionand though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear ofman yet the far different nature of the whalehunt peremptorilyforbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan  Forty men in one shiphunting the Sperm Whales for fortyeight months think they have doneextremely well and thank God if at last they carry home the oil offorty fish  Whereas in the days of the old Canadian and Indianhunters and trappers of the West when the far west in whose sunsetsuns still rise was a wilderness and a virgin the same number ofmoccasined men for the same number of months mounted on horseinstead of sailing in ships would have slain not forty but fortythousand and more buffaloes a fact that if need were could bestatistically statedNor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of thegradual extinction of the Sperm Whale for example that in formeryears the latter part of the last century say these Leviathans insmall pods were encountered much oftener than at present and inconsequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also muchmore remunerative  Because as has been elsewhere noticed thosewhales influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas inimmense caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitariesyokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated intovast but widely separated unfrequent armies  That is all  Andequally fallacious seems the conceit that because the socalledwhalebone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former yearsabounding with them hence that species also is declining  For theyare only being driven from promontory to cape and if one coast is nolonger enlivened with their jets then be sure some other andremoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliarspectacleFurthermore concerning these last mentioned Leviathans they havetwo firm fortresses which in all human probability will for everremain impregnable  And as upon the invasion of their valleys thefrosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains so hunted from thesavannas and glades of the middle seas the whalebone whales can atlast resort to their Polar citadels and diving under the ultimateglassy barriers and walls there come up among icy fields and floesand in a charmed circle of everlasting December bid defiance to allpursuit from manBut as perhaps fifty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for onecachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded thatthis positive havoc has already very seriously diminished theirbattalions  But though for some time past a number of these whalesnot less than 13000 have been annually slain on the norwestcoast by the Americans alone yet there are considerations whichrender even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposingargument in this matterNatural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning thepopulousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe yet whatshall we say to Harto the historian of Goa when he tells us that atone hunting the King of Siam took 4000 elephants that in thoseregions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperateclimes  And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephantswhich have now been hunted for thousands of years by Semiramis byPorus by Hannibal and by all the successive monarchs of theEastif they still survive there in great numbers much more may thegreat whale outlast all hunting since he has a pasture to expatiatein which is precisely twice as large as all Asia both AmericasEurope and Africa New Holland and all the Isles of the seacombinedMoreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevityof whales their probably attaining the age of a century and moretherefore at any one period of time several distinct adultgenerations must be contemporary  And what that is we may soongain some idea of by imagining all the graveyards cemeteries andfamily vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the menwomen and children who were alive seventyfive years ago and addingthis countless host to the present human population of the globeWherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in hisspecies however perishable in his individuality  He swam the seasbefore the continents broke water he once swam over the site of theTuileries and Windsor Castle and the Kremlin  In Noahs flood hedespised Noahs Ark and if ever the world is to be again floodedlike the Netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whalewill still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of theequatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the skiesCHAPTER 106Ahabs LegThe precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the SamuelEnderby of London had not been unattended with some small violenceto his own person  He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart ofhis boat that his ivory leg had received a halfsplintering shockAnd when after gaining his own deck and his own pivothole there heso vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersmanit was as ever something about his not steering inflexiblyenough then the already shaken ivory received such an additionaltwist and wrench that though it still remained entire and to allappearances lusty yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthyAnd indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all hispervading mad recklessness Ahab did at times give careful heed tothe condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood  For ithad not been very long prior to the Pequods sailing from Nantucketthat he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground andinsensible by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginablecasualty his ivory limb having been so violently displaced that ithad stakewise smitten and all but pierced his groin nor was itwithout extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirelycuredNor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind thatall the anguish of that then present suffering was but the directissue of a former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as themost poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind asinevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove so equally withevery felicity all miserable events do naturally beget their likeYea more than equally thought Ahab since both the ancestry andposterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of JoyFor not to hint of this that it is an inference from certaincanonic teachings that while some natural enjoyments here shall haveno children born to them for the other world but on the contraryshall be followed by the joychildlessness of all hells despairwhereas some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget tothemselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond thegrave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequality inthe deeper analysis of the thing  For thought Ahab while even thehighest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettinesslurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mysticsignificance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do theirdiligent tracingsout not belie the obvious deduction  To trail thegenealogies of these high mortal miseries carries us at last amongthe sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face ofall the glad haymaking suns and soft cymballing roundharvestmoons we must needs give in to this that the godsthemselves are not for ever glad  The ineffaceable sad birthmarkin the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow in the signersUnwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might moreproperly in set way have been disclosed before  With many otherparticulars concerning Ahab always had it remained a mystery tosome why it was that for a certain period both before and afterthe sailing of the Pequod he had hidden himself away with suchGrandLamalike exclusiveness and for that one interval soughtspeechless refuge as it were among the marble senate of the deadCaptain Pelegs bruited reason for this thing appeared by no meansadequate though indeed as touching all Ahabs deeper part everyrevelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatorylight  But in the end it all came out this one matter did atleast  That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporaryrecluseness  And not only this but to that evercontractingdropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed the privilegeof a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the abovehinted casualtyremaining as it did moodily unaccounted for byAhabinvested itself with terrors not entirely underived from theland of spirits and of wails  So that through their zeal for himthey had all conspired so far as in them lay to muffle up theknowledge of this thing from others and hence it was that not tilla considerable interval had elapsed did it transpire upon thePequods decksBut be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in theair or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do ornot with earthly Ahab yet in this present matter of his leg hetook plain practical procedureshe called the carpenterAnd when that functionary appeared before him he bade him withoutdelay set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see himsupplied with all the studs and joists of jawivory Sperm Whalewhich had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that acareful selection of the stoutest clearestgrained stuff might besecured  This done the carpenter received orders to have the legcompleted that night and to provide all the fittings for itindependent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in useMoreover the ships forge was ordered to be hoisted out of itstemporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate the affair theblacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging ofwhatever iron contrivances might be neededCHAPTER 107The CarpenterSeat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn and take highabstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woeBut from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most partthey seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary andhereditary  But most humble though he was and far from furnishingan example of the high humane abstraction the Pequods carpenterwas no duplicate hence he now comes in person on this stageLike all seagoing ship carpenters and more especially thosebelonging to whaling vessels he was to a certain offhandedpractical extent alike experienced in numerous trades and callingscollateral to his own the carpenters pursuit being the ancient andoutbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more orless have to do with wood as an auxiliary material  But besides theapplication to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of thePequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanicalemergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a three orfour years voyage in uncivilized and fardistant seas  For not tospeak of his readiness in ordinary dutiesrepairing stove boatssprung spars reforming the shape of clumsybladed oars insertingbulls eyes in the deck or new treenails in the side planks andother miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his specialbusiness he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner ofconflicting aptitudes both useful and capriciousThe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts somanifold was his vicebench a long rude ponderous table furnishedwith several vices of different sizes and both of iron and of woodAt all times except when whales were alongside this bench wassecurely lashed athwartships against the rear of the TryworksA belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into itshole the carpenter claps it into one of his everready vices andstraightway files it smaller

An oarsman sprains his wristthe carpenter concocts a soothing lotion  Stubb longed forvermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oarscrewing each oar in his big vice of wood the carpentersymmetrically supplies the constellation  A sailor takes a fancy towear sharkbone earrings the carpenter drills his ears  Anotherhas the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping one handupon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellowunmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation whirling roundthe handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap hisjaw in that if he would have him draw the toothThus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alikeindifferent and without respect in all  Teeth he accounted bits ofivory heads he deemed but topblocks men themselves he lightly heldfor capstans  But while now upon so wide a field thus variouslyaccomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too allthis would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence  Butnot precisely so  For nothing was this man more remarkable than fora certain impersonal stolidity as it were impersonal I say for itso shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things that it seemedone with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visibleworld which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes stilleternally holds its peace and ignores you though you digfoundations for cathedrals  Yet was this halfhorrible stolidity inhim involving too as it appeared an allramifyingheartlessnessyet was it oddly dashed at times with an oldcrutchlike antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked nowand then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have servedto pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastleof Noahs ark  Was it that this old carpenter had been a lifelongwanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered nomoss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outwardclingings might have originally pertained to him  He was a striptabstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised as a newborn babeliving without premeditated reference to this world or the next  Youmight almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involveda sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seemto work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he hadbeen tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even oruneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literalprocess  He was a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever hadone must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers  Hewas like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful MULTUM INPARVO Sheffield contrivances assuming the exteriorthough a littleswelledof a common pocket knife but containing not only blades ofvarious sizes but also screwdrivers corkscrews tweezers awlspens rulers nailfilers countersinkers  So if his superiorswanted to use the carpenter for a screwdriver all they had to dowas to open that part of him and the screw was fast or if fortweezers take him up by the legs and there they wereYet as previously hinted this omnitooled openandshut carpenterwas after all no mere machine of an automaton  If he did not havea common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehowanomalously did its duty  What that was whether essence ofquicksilver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling  Butthere it was and there it had abided for now some sixty years ormore  And this it was this same unaccountable cunninglifeprinciple in him this it was that kept him a great part of thetime soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which alsohummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a sentrybox and thissoliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himselfawakeCHAPTER 108Ahab and the CarpenterThe DeckFirst Night WatchCARPENTER STANDING BEFORE HIS VICEBENCH AND BY THE LIGHT OF TWOLANTERNS BUSILY FILING THE IVORY JOIST FOR THE LEG

inconsiderable oil came up with the water the casks below musthave sprung a bad leak  Much concern was shown and Starbuck wentdown into the cabin to report this unfavourable affairIn Spermwhalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board itis a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold anddrench the casks with seawater which afterwards at varyingintervals is removed by the ships pumps  Hereby the casks aresought to be kept damply tight while by the changed character of thewithdrawn water the mariners readily detect any serious leakage inthe precious cargoNow from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosaand the Bashee Isles between which lies one of the tropical outletsfrom the China waters into the Pacific  And so Starbuck found Ahabwith a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before himand another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of theJapanese islandsNiphon Matsmai and Sikoke  With his snowwhitenew ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with along pruninghook of a jackknife in his hand the wondrous old manwith his back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow andtracing his old courses againWhos there hearing the footstep at the door but not turninground to it  On deck  BegoneCaptain Ahab mistakes it is I  The oil in the hold is leakingsir  We must up Burtons and break outUp Burtons and break out  Now that we are nearing Japan heavetohere for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoopsEither do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may makegood in a year  What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worthsaving sirSo it is so it is if we get itI was speaking of the oil in the hold sirAnd I was not speaking or thinking of that at all  Begone  Let itleak  Im all aleak myself  Aye leaks in leaks not only full ofleaky casks but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and thats afar worse plight than the Pequods man  Yet I dont stop to plug myleak for who can find it in the deeploaded hull or how hope toplug it even if found in this lifes howling gale  StarbuckIll not have the Burtons hoistedWhat will the owners say sirLet the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the TyphoonsWhat cares Ahab  Owners owners  Thou art always prating to meStarbuck about those miserly owners as if the owners were myconscience  But look ye the only real owner of anything is itscommander and hark ye my conscience is in this ships keelOndeckCaptain Ahab said the reddening mate moving further into thecabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that italmost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightestoutward manifestation of itself but within also seemed more thanhalf distrustful of itself A better man than I might well pass overin thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man ayeand in a happier Captain AhabDevils  Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think ofmeOn deckNay sir not yet I do entreat  And I do dare sirto beforbearing  Shall we not understand each other better than hithertoCaptain AhabAhab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of mostSouthSeamens cabin furniture and pointing it towards Starbuckexclaimed There is one God that is Lord over the earth and oneCaptain that is lord over the PequodOn deckFor an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate and his fierycheeks you would have almost thought that he had really received theblaze of the levelled tube  But mastering his emotion he halfcalmly rose and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant andsaid Thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that I askthee not to beware of Starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let Ahabbeware of Ahab beware of thyself old manHe waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery thatmurmured Ahab as Starbuck disappeared  Whats that he saidAhabbeware of Ahabtheres something there  Then unconsciously usingthe musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in thelittle cabin but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxedand returning the gun to the rack he went to the deckThou art but too good a fellow Starbuck he said lowly to themate then raising his voice to the crew Furl the tgallantsailsand closereef the topsails fore and aft back the mainyard upBurton and break out in the mainholdIt were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that asrespecting Starbuck Ahab thus acted  It may have been a flash ofhonesty in him or mere prudential policy which under thecircumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of opendisaffection however transient in the important chief officer ofhis ship  However it was his orders were executed and the Burtonswere hoistedCHAPTER 110Queequeg in His CoffinUpon searching it was found that the casks last struck into the holdwere perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off  So itbeing calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing theslumbers of the huge groundtier butts and from that black midnightsending those gigantic moles into the daylight above  So deep didthey go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of thelowermost puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldycornerstone cask containing coins of Captain Noah with copies ofthe posted placards vainly warning the infatuated old world from theflood  Tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef andshooks of staves and iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out tillat last the piled decks were hard to get about and the hollow hullechoed under foot as if you were treading over empty catacombs andreeled and rolled in the sea like an airfreighted demijohnTopheavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle inhis head  Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them thenNow at this time it was that my poor pagan companion and fastbosomfriend Queequeg was seized with a fever which brought himnigh to his endless endBe it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures are unknowndignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be Captain thehigher you rise the harder you toil  So with poor Queequeg who asharpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whalebutas we have elsewhere seenmount his dead back in a rolling seaand finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweatingall day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle theclumsiest casks and see to their stowage  To be short amongwhalemen the harpooneers are the holders so calledPoor Queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you shouldhave stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him therewhere stripped to his woollen drawers the tattooed savage wascrawling about amid that dampness and slime like a green spottedlizard at the bottom of a well  And a well or an icehouse itsomehow proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all theheat of his sweatings he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into afever and at last after some days suffering laid him in hishammock close to the very sill of the door of death  How he wastedand wasted away in those few longlingering days till there seemedbut little left of him but his frame and tattooing  But as all elsein him thinned and his cheekbones grew sharper his eyesnevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of astrange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply looked out at youthere from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal healthin him which could not die or be weakened  And like circles on thewater which as they grow fainter expand so his eyes seemedrounding and rounding like the rings of Eternity  An awe thatcannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of thiswaning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any beheldwho were bystanders when Zoroaster died  For whatever is trulywondrous and fearful in man never yet was put into words or booksAnd the drawing near of Death which alike levels all alikeimpresses all with a last revelation which only an author from thedead could adequately tell  So thatlet us say it againno dyingChaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those whosemysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg ashe quietly lay in his swaying hammock and the rolling sea seemedgently rocking him to his final rest and the oceans invisiblefloodtide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heavenNot a man of the crew but gave him up and as for Queequeg himselfwhat he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour heasked  He called one to him in the grey morning watch when the daywas just breaking and taking his hand said that while in Nantuckethe had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood like therich warwood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learnedthat all whalemen who died in Nantucket were laid in those same darkcanoes and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him forit was not unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming adead warrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to befloated away to the starry archipelagoes for not only do theybelieve that the stars are isles but that far beyond all visiblehorizons their own mild uncontinented seas interflow with the blueheavens and so form the white breakers of the milky way  He addedthat he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammockaccording to the usual seacustom tossed like something vile to thedeathdevouring sharks  No he desired a canoe like those ofNantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that likea whaleboat these coffincanoes were without a keel though thatinvolved but uncertain steering and much leeway adown the dim agesNow when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenterwas at once commanded to do Queequegs bidding whatever it mightinclude  There was some heathenish coffincoloured old lumberaboard which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from theaboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands and from these dark planksthe coffin was recommended to be made  No sooner was the carpenterapprised of the order than taking his rule he forthwith with allthe indifferent promptitude of his character proceeded into theforecastle and took Queequegs measure with great accuracy regularlychalking Queequegs person as he shifted the ruleAh poor fellow hell have to die now ejaculated the Long IslandsailorGoing to his vicebench the carpenter for convenience sake andgeneral reference now transferringly measured on it the exact lengththe coffin was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cuttingtwo notches at its extremities  This done he marshalled the planksand his tools and to workWhen the last nail was driven and the lid duly planed and fitted helightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiringwhether they were ready for it yet in that directionOverhearing the indignant but halfhumorous cries with which thepeople on deck began to drive the coffin away Queequeg to everyones consternation commanded that the thing should be instantlybrought to him nor was there any denying him seeing that of allmortals some dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly sincethey will shortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor fellowsought to be indulgedLeaning over in his hammock Queequeg long regarded the coffin withan attentive eye  He then called for his harpoon had the woodenstock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffinalong with one of the paddles of his boat  All by his own requestalso biscuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask offresh water was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earthscraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sailcloth beingrolled up for a pillow Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into hisfinal bed that he might make trial of its comforts if any it hadHe lay without moving a few minutes then told one to go to his bagand bring out his little god Yojo  Then crossing his arms on hisbreast with Yojo between he called for the coffin lid hatch hecalled it to be placed over him  The head part turned over with aleather hinge and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little buthis composed countenance in view  Rarmai it will do it is easyhe murmured at last and signed to be replaced in his hammockBut ere this was done Pip who had been slily hovering near by allthis while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbingstook him by the hand in the other holding his tambourinePoor rover will ye never have done with all this weary rovingwhere go ye now  But if the currents carry ye to those sweetAntilles where the beaches are only beat with waterlilies will yedo one little errand for me  Seek out one Pip whos now beenmissing long I think hes in those far Antilles  If ye find himthen comfort him for he must be very sad for look hes left histambourine behindI found it  Rigadig dig dig  Now Queequegdie and Ill beat ye your dying marchI have heard murmured Starbuck gazing down the scuttle that inviolent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient tonguesand that when the mystery is probed it turns out always that intheir wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had beenreally spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars  So to myfond faith poor Pip in this strange sweetness of his lunacy bringsheavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes  Where learned he thatbut thereHark he speaks again but more wildly nowForm two and two  Lets make a General of him  Ho wheres hisharpoon  Lay it across hereRigadig dig dig huzza  Oh for agame cock now to sit upon his head and crow  Queequeg diesgamemind ye that Queequeg dies gametake ye good heed of thatQueequeg dies game  I say game game game but base little Pip hedied a coward died all ashiverout upon Pip  Hark ye if ye findPip tell all the Antilles hes a runaway a coward a coward acoward  Tell them he jumped from a whaleboat  Id never beat mytambourine over base Pip and hail him General if he were once moredying here  No no shame upon all cowardsshame upon them  Let emgo drown like Pip that jumped from a whaleboat  Shame shameDuring all this Queequeg lay with closed eyes as if in a dreamPip was led away and the sick man was replaced in his hammockBut now that he had apparently made every preparation for death nowthat his coffin was proved a good fit Queequeg suddenly ralliedsoon there seemed no need of the carpenters box and thereuponwhen some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance saidthat the cause of his sudden convalescence was thisat a criticalmoment he had just recalled a little duty ashore which he wasleaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying hecould not die yet he averred  They asked him then whether to liveor die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure  Heanswered certainly  In a word it was Queequegs conceit that if aman made up his mind to live mere sickness could not kill himnothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernableunintelligent destroyer of that sortNow there is this noteworthy difference between savage andcivilized that while a sick civilized man may be six monthsconvalescing generally speaking a sick savage is almost halfwellagain in a day  So in good time my Queequeg gained strength and atlength after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days buteating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feetthrew out his arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawneda little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boatand poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fightWith a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a seachest andemptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order thereMany spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner ofgrotesque figures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he wasstriving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing onhis body  And this tattooing had been the work of a departedprophet and seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks hadwritten out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and theearth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so thatQueequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrouswork in one volume but whose mysteries not even himself could readthough his own live heart beat against them and these mysteries weretherefore destined in the end to moulder away with the livingparchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to thelast  And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahabthat wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away fromsurveying poor QueequegOh devilish tantalization of the godsCHAPTER 111The PacificWhen gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the greatSouth Sea were it not for other things I could have greeted my dearPacific with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of myyouth was answered that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me athousand leagues of blueThere is one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea whosegently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneathlike those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buriedEvangelist St John  And meet it is that over these seapastureswiderolling watery prairies and Potters Fields of all fourcontinents the waves should rise and fall and ebb and flowunceasingly for here millions of mixed shades and shadows drowneddreams somnambulisms reveries all that we call lives and soulslie dreaming dreaming still tossing like slumberers in their bedsthe everrolling waves but made so by their restlessnessTo any meditative Magian rover this serene Pacific once beheldmust ever after be the sea of his adoption  It rolls the midmostwaters of the world the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but itsarms  The same waves wash the moles of the newbuilt Californiantowns but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men and lavethe faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands older thanAbraham while all between float milkyways of coral isles andlowlying endless unknown Archipelagoes and impenetrable JapansThus this mysterious divine Pacific zones the worlds whole bulkabout makes all coasts one bay to it seems the tidebeating heartof earth  Lifted by those eternal swells you needs must own theseductive god bowing your head to PanBut few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahabs brain as standing like aniron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging withone nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Basheeisles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking and withthe other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found seathat sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimmingLaunched at length upon these almost final waters and glidingtowards the Japanese cruisingground the old mans purposeintensified itself  His firm lips met like the lips of a vice theDelta of his foreheads veins swelled like overladen brooks in hisvery sleep his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull Stern allthe White Whale spouts thick bloodCHAPTER 112The BlacksmithAvailing himself of the mild summercool weather that now reignedin these latitudes and in preparation for the peculiarly activepursuits shortly to be anticipated Perth the begrimed blisteredold blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold againafter concluding his contributory work for Ahabs leg but stillretained it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast beingnow almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen and harpooneers andbowsmen to do some little job for them altering or repairing ornew shaping their various weapons and boat furniture  Often he wouldbe surrounded by an eager circle all waiting to be served holdingboatspades pikeheads harpoons and lances and jealously watchinghis every sooty movement as he toiled  Nevertheless this old manswas a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm  No murmur noimpatience no petulance did come from him  Silent slow andsolemn bowing over still further his chronically broken back hetoiled away as if toil were life itself and the heavy beating ofhis hammer the heavy beating of his heart  And so it wasMostmiserableA peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painfulappearing yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyageexcited the curiosity of the mariners  And to the importunity oftheir persisted questionings he had finally given in and so it cameto pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretchedfateBelated and not innocently one bitter winters midnight on theroad running between two country towns the blacksmith halfstupidlyfelt the deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in aleaning dilapidated barn  The issue was the loss of theextremities of both feet  Out of this revelation part by part atlast came out the four acts of the gladness and the one long and asyet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his lifes dramaHe was an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedlyencountered that thing in sorrows technicals called ruin  He hadbeen an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to do owned ahouse and garden embraced a youthful daughterlike loving wifeand three blithe ruddy children every Sunday went to acheerfullooking church planted in a grove  But one night undercover of darkness and further concealed in a most cunningdisguisement a desperate burglar slid into his happy home androbbed them all of everything  And darker yet to tell theblacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into hisfamilys heart  It was the Bottle Conjuror  Upon the opening ofthat fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shrivelled up his homeNow for prudent most wise and economic reasons the blacksmithsshop was in the basement of his dwelling but with a separateentrance to it so that always had the young and loving healthy wifelistened with no unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure tothe stout ringing of her youngarmed old husbands hammer whosereverberations muffled by passing through the floors and walls cameup to her not unsweetly in her nursery and so to stout Laborsiron lullaby the blacksmiths infants were rocked to slumberOh woe on woe  Oh Death why canst thou not sometimes be timelyHadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruincame upon him then had the young widow had a delicious grief andher orphans a truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in theirafter years and all of them a carekilling competency  But Deathplucked down some virtuous elder brother on whose whistling dailytoil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family and leftthe worse than useless old man standing till the hideous rot of lifeshould make him easier to harvestWhy tell the whole  The blows of the basement hammer every day grewmore and more between and each blow every day grew fainter than thelast the wife sat frozen at the window with tearless eyesglitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children thebellows fell the forge choked up with cinders the house was soldthe mother dived down into the long churchyard grass her childrentwice followed her thither and the houseless familyless old manstaggered off a vagabond in crape his every woe unreverenced hisgrey head a scorn to flaxen curlsDeath seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this butDeath is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried itis but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immenseRemote the Wild the Watery the Unshored therefore to thedeathlonging eyes of such men who still have left in them someinterior compunctions against suicide does the allcontributed andallreceptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain ofunimaginable taking terrors and wonderful newlife adventures andfrom the hearts of infinite Pacifics the thousand mermaids sing tothemCome hither brokenhearted here is another life without theguilt of intermediate death here are wonders supernatural withoutdying for them  Come hither bury thyself in a life which to yournow equally abhorred and abhorring landed world is more obliviousthan death  Come hither put up THY gravestone too within thechurchyard and come hither till we marry theeHearkening to these voices East and West by early sunrise and byfall of eve the blacksmiths soul responded Aye I come  And soPerth went awhalingCHAPTER 113The ForgeWith matted beard and swathed in a bristling sharkskin apron aboutmidday Perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latterplaced upon an ironwood log with one hand holding a pikehead inthe coals and with the other at his forges lungs when Captain Ahabcame along carrying in his hand a small rustylooking leathern bagWhile yet a little distance from the forge moody Ahab paused tillat last Perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammeringit upon the anvilthe red mass sending off the sparks in thickhovering flights some of which flew close to AhabAre these thy Mother Careys chickens Perth they are always flyingin thy wake birds of good omen too but not to alllook herethey burn but thouthou livst among them without a scorchBecause I am scorched all over Captain Ahab answered Perthresting for a moment on his hammer I am past scorching not easilycanst thou scorch a scarWell well no more  Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly sanelywoeful to me  In no Paradise myself I am impatient of all misery inothers that is not mad  Thou shouldst go mad blacksmith say whydost thou not go mad  How canst thou endure without being mad  Dothe heavens yet hate thee that thou canst not go madWhat wertthou making thereWelding an old pikehead sir there were seams and dents in itAnd canst thou make it all smooth again blacksmith after suchhard usage as it hadI think so sirAnd I suppose thou canst smoothe almost any seams and dents nevermind how hard the metal blacksmithAye sir I think I can all seams and dents but oneLook ye here then cried Ahab passionately advancing and leaningwith both hands on Perths shoulders look ye hereHEREcan yesmoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand acrosshis ribbed brow if thou couldst blacksmith glad enough would Ilay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between myeyes  Answer  Canst thou smoothe this seamOh that is the one sir  Said I not all seams and dents but oneAye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable forthough thou only seest it here in my flesh it has worked down intothe bone of my skullTHAT is all wrinkles  But away with childsplay no more gaffs and pikes today  Look ye here jingling theleathern bag as if it were full of gold coins  I too want aharpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not partPerth something that will stick in a whale like his own finboneTheres the stuff flinging the pouch upon the anvil  Look yeblacksmith these are the gathered nailstubbs of the steel shoes ofracing horsesHorseshoe stubbs sir  Why Captain Ahab thou hast here thenthe best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever workI know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue fromthe melted bones of murderers  Quick forge me the harpoon  Andforge me first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist andhammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of atowline  Quick  Ill blow the fireWhen at last the twelve rods were made Ahab tried them one by oneby spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron boltA flaw rejecting the last one  Work that over again PerthThis done Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one whenAhab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron  As thenwith regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil Perth passingto him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressedforge shooting up its intense straight flame the Parsee passedsilently and bowing over his head towards the fire seemed invokingsome curse or some blessing on the toil  But as Ahab looked up heslid asideWhats that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for mutteredStubb looking on from the forecastle  That Parsee smells fire likea fusee and smells of it himself like a hot muskets powderpanAt last the shank in one complete rod received its final heat andas Perth to temper it plunged it all hissing into the cask of waternear by the scalding steam shot up into Ahabs bent faceWouldst thou brand me Perth wincing for a moment with the painhave I been but forging my own brandingiron thenPray God not that yet I fear something Captain Ahab  Is not thisharpoon for the White WhaleFor the white fiend  But now for the barbs thou must make themthyself man  Here are my razorsthe best of steel here and makethe barbs sharp as the needlesleet of the Icy SeaFor a moment the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he wouldfain not use themTake them man I have no need for them for I now neither shavesup nor pray tillbut hereto workFashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by Perth to theshank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as theblacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat prior totempering them he cried to Ahab to place the watercask nearNo nono water for that I want it of the true deathtemperAhoy there  Tashtego Queequeg Daggoo  What say ye pagans  Willye give me as much blood as will cover this barb holding it highup  A cluster of dark nods replied Yes  Three punctures were madein the heathen flesh and the White Whales barbs were then temperedEgo non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diabolideliriously howled Ahab as the malignant iron scorchingly devouredthe baptismal bloodNow mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one ofhickory with the bark still investing it Ahab fitted the end to thesocket of the iron  A coil of new towline was then unwound andsome fathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a greattension  Pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like aharpstring then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandingsAhab exclaimed Good and now for the seizingsAt one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spreadyarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon thepole was then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end therope was traced halfway along the poles length and firmly securedso with intertwistings of twine  This done pole iron andropelike the Three Fatesremained inseparable and Ahab moodilystalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and thesound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plankBut ere he entered his cabin light unnatural halfbantering yetmost piteous sound was heard  Oh Pip thy wretched laugh thyidle but unresting eye all thy strange mummeries not unmeaninglyblended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked itCHAPTER 114The GilderPenetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanesecruising ground the Pequod was soon all astir in the fisheryOften in mild pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen andtwenty hours on the stretch they were engaged in the boats steadilypulling or sailing or paddling after the whales or for aninterlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprisingthough with but small success for their painsAt such times under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slowheaving swells seated in his boat light as a birch canoe and sosociably mixing with the soft waves themselves that likehearthstone cats they purr against the gunwale these are the timesof dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancyof the oceans skin one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneathit and would not willingly remember that this velvet paw butconceals a remorseless fangThese are the times when in his whaleboat the rover softly feels acertain filial confident landlike feeling towards the sea that heregards it as so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealingonly the tops of her masts seems struggling forward not throughhigh rolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prairieas when the western emigrants horses only show their erected earswhile their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdureThe longdrawn virgin vales the mild blue hillsides as over thesethere steals the hush the hum you almost swear that playweariedchildren lie sleeping in these solitudes in some glad Maytime whenthe flowers of the woods are plucked  And all this mixes with yourmost mystic mood so that fact and fancy halfway meetinginterpenetrate and form one seamless wholeNor did such soothing scenes however temporary fail of at least astemporary an effect on Ahab  But if these secret golden keys didseem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries yet did hisbreath upon them prove but tarnishingOh grassy glades oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul inyethough long parched by the dead drought of the earthylifein ye men yet may roll like young horses in new morningclover and for some few fleeting moments feel the cool dew of thelife immortal on them  Would to God these blessed calms would lastBut the mingled mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woofcalms crossed by storms a storm for every calm  There is no steadyunretracing progress in this life we do not advance through fixedgradations and at the last one pausethrough infancys unconsciousspell boyhoods thoughtless faith adolescence doubt the commondoom then scepticism then disbelief resting at last in manhoodspondering repose of If  But once gone through we trace the roundagain and are infants boys and men and Ifs eternally  Where liesthe final harbor whence we unmoor no more  In what rapt ether sailsthe world of which the weariest will never weary  Where is thefoundlings father hidden  Our souls are like those orphans whoseunwedded mothers die in bearing them the secret of our paternitylies in their grave and we must there to learn itAnd that same day too gazing far down from his boats side intothat same golden sea Starbuck lowly murmuredLoveliness unfathomable as ever lover saw in his young brideseyeTell me not of thy teethtiered sharks and thy kidnappingcannibal ways  Let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory I lookdeep down and do believeAnd Stubb fishlike with sparkling scales leaped up in that samegolden lightI am Stubb and Stubb has his history but here Stubb takes oathsthat he has always been jollyCHAPTER 115The Pequod Meets The BachelorAnd jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearingdown before the wind some few weeks after Ahabs harpoon had beenweldedIt was a Nantucket ship the Bachelor which had just wedged in herlast cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now inglad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vaingloriouslysailing round among the widelyseparated ships on the groundprevious to pointing her prow for homeThe three men at her masthead wore long streamers of narrow redbunting at their hats from the stern a whaleboat was suspendedbottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the longlower jaw of the last whale they had slain  Signals ensigns andjacks of all colours were flying from her rigging on every sideSideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrelsof sperm above which in her topmast crosstrees you saw slenderbreakers of the same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck wasa brazen lampAs was afterwards learned the Bachelor had met with the mostsurprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruisingin the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire monthswithout securing a single fish  Not only had barrels of beef andbread been given away to make room for the far more valuable spermbut additional supplemental casks had been bartered for from theships she had met and these were stowed along the deck and in thecaptains and officers staterooms  Even the cabin table itselfhad been knocked into kindlingwood and the cabin mess dined off thebroad head of an oilbutt lashed down to the floor for acentrepiece  In the forecastle the sailors had actually caulkedand pitched their chests and filled them it was humorously addedthat the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and filledit that the steward had plugged his spare coffeepot and filled itthat the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filledthem that indeed everything was filled with sperm except thecaptains pantaloons pockets and those he reserved to thrust hishands into in selfcomplacent testimony of his entire satisfactionAs this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod thebarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle anddrawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round herhuge trypots which covered with the parchmentlike POKE or stomachskin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of theclenched hands of the crew  On the quarterdeck the mates andharpooneers were dancing with the olivehued girls who had elopedwith them from the Polynesian Isles while suspended in anornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast andmainmast three Long Island negroes with glittering fiddlebows ofwhale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig  Meanwhileothers of the ships company were tumultuously busy at the masonry ofthe tryworks from which the huge pots had been removed  You wouldhave almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille suchwild cries they raised as the now useless brick and mortar werebeing hurled into the seaLord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on theships elevated quarterdeck so that the whole rejoicing drama wasfull before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individualdiversionAnd Ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and blackwith a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each otherswakesone all jubilations for things passed the other allforebodings as to things to cometheir two captains in themselvesimpersonated the whole striking contrast of the sceneCome aboard come aboard cried the gay Bachelors commanderlifting a glass and a bottle in the airHast seen the White Whale gritted Ahab in replyNo only heard of him but dont believe in him at all said theother goodhumoredly  Come aboardThou art too damned jolly  Sail on  Hast lost any menNot enough to speak oftwo islanders thats allbut come aboardold hearty come along  Ill soon take that black from your browCome along will ye merrys the play a full ship andhomewardboundHow wondrous familiar is a fool muttered Ahab then aloud Thouart a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call mean empty ship and outwardbound  So go thy ways and I will mineForward there  Set all sail and keep her to the windAnd thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze theother stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels partedthe crew of the Pequod looking with grave lingering glances towardsthe receding Bachelor but the Bachelors men never heeding theirgaze for the lively revelry they were in  And as Ahab leaning overthe taffrail eyed the homewardbound craft he took from his pocket asmall vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vialseemed thereby bringing two remote associations together for thatvial was filled with Nantucket soundingsCHAPTER 116The Dying WhaleNot seldom in this life when on the right side fortunes favouritessail close by us we though all adroop before catch somewhat of therushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out  Soseemed it with the Pequod  For next day after encountering the gayBachelor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them byAhabIt was far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of thecrimson fight were done and floating in the lovely sunset sea andsky sun and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetnessand such plaintiveness such inwreathing orisons curled up in thatrosy air that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep greenconvent valleys of the Manilla isles the Spanish landbreezewantonly turned sailor had gone to sea freighted with these vesperhymnsSoothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom Ahab who hadsterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final waningsfrom the now tranquil boat  For that strange spectacle observable inall sperm whales dyingthe turning sunwards of the head and soexpiringthat strange spectacle beheld of such a placid eveningsomehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown beforeHe turns and turns him to ithow slowly but how steadfastly hishomagerendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions  Hetoo worships fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of thesunOh that these toofavouring eyes should see these toofavouringsights  Look here far waterlocked beyond all hum of human wealor woe in these most candid and impartial seas where to traditionsno rocks furnish tablets where for long Chinese ages the billowshave still rolled on speechless and unspoken to as stars that shineupon the Nigers unknown source here too life dies sunwards fullof faith but see no sooner dead than death whirls round thecorpse and it heads some other wayOh thou dark Hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hastbuilded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of theseunverdured seas thou art an infidel thou queen and too trulyspeakest to me in the wideslaughtering Typhoon and the hushedburial of its after calm  Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned hisdying head and then gone round again without a lesson to meOh trebly hooped and welded hip of power  Oh high aspiringrainbowed jetthat one strivest this one jettest all in vain  Invain oh whale dost thou seek intercedings with yon allquickeningsun that only calls forth life but gives it not again  Yet dostthou darker half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith  Allthy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here I am buoyed bybreaths of once living things exhaled as air but water nowThen hail for ever hail O sea in whose eternal tossings the wildfowl finds his only rest  Born of earth yet suckled by the seathough hill and valley mothered me ye billows are myfosterbrothersCHAPTER 117The Whale WatchThe four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far towindward one less distant to leeward one ahead one asternThese last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but thewindward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that hadkilled it lay by its side all night and that boat was AhabsThe waifpole was thrust upright into the dead whales spoutholeand the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickeringglare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnightwaves which gently chafed the whales broad flank like soft surfupon a beachAhab and all his boats crew seemed asleep but the Parsee whocrouching in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally playedround the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tailsA sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgivenghosts of Gomorrah ran shuddering through the airStarted from his slumbers Ahab face to face saw the Parsee andhooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in aflooded world  I have dreamed it again said heOf the hearses  Have I not said old man that neither hearse norcoffin can be thineAnd who are hearsed that die on the seaBut I said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage twohearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made bymortal hands and the visible wood of the last one must be grown inAmericaAye aye a strange sight that Parseea hearse and its plumesfloating over the ocean with the waves for the pallbearers  HaSuch a sight we shall not soon seeBelieve it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old manAnd what was that saying about thyselfThough it come to the last I shall still go before thee thy pilotAnd when thou art so gone beforeif that ever befallthen ere Ican follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me stillWas itnot so  Well then did I believe all ye say oh my pilot  I havehere two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive itTake another pledge old man said the Parsee as his eyes lightedup like fireflies in the gloomHemp only can kill theeThe gallows ye meanI am immortal then on land and on seacried Ahab with a laugh of derisionImmortal on land and on seaBoth were silent again as one man  The grey dawn came on and theslumbering crew arose from the boats bottom and ere noon the deadwhale was brought to the shipCHAPTER 118The QuadrantThe season for the Line at length drew near and every day when Ahabcoming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsmanwould ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager marinersquickly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyescentrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order topoint the ships prow for the equator  In good time the order cameIt was hard upon high noon and Ahab seated in the bows of hishighhoisted boat was about taking his wonted daily observation ofthe sun to determine his latitudeNow in that Japanese sea the days in summer are as freshets ofeffulgences  That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazingfocus of the glassy oceans immeasurable burningglass  The skylooks lacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and thisnakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors ofGods throne  Well that Ahabs quadrant was furnished with colouredglasses through which to take sight of that solar fire  Soswinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with hisastrologicallooking instrument placed to his eye he remained inthat posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when thesun should gain its precise meridian  Meantime while his wholeattention was absorbed the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on theships deck and with face thrown up like Ahabs was eyeing the samesun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs andhis wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness  At lengththe desired observation was taken and with his pencil upon his ivoryleg Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that preciseinstant  Then falling into a moments revery he again looked uptowards the sun and murmured to himself Thou seamark thou highand mighty Pilot thou tellest me truly where I AMbut canst thoucast the least hint where I SHALL be  Or canst thou tell where someother thing besides me is this moment living  Where is Moby DickThis instant thou must be eyeing him  These eyes of mine look intothe very eye that is even now beholding him aye and into the eyethat is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknownthither side of thee thou sunThen gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other itsnumerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and mutteredFoolish toy babies plaything of haughty Admirals and Commodoresand Captains the world brags of thee of thy cunning and might butwhat after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point wherethou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand thatholds thee no not one jot more  Thou canst not tell where one dropof water or one grain of sand will be tomorrow noon and yet withthy impotence thou insultest the sun  Science  Curse thee thouvain toy and cursed be all the things that cast mans eyes aloft tothat heaven whose live vividness but scorches him as these old eyesare even now scorched with thy light O sun  Level by nature to thisearths horizon are the glances of mans eyes not shot from thecrown of his head as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmamentCurse thee thou quadrant dashing it to the deck no longer will Iguide my earthly way by thee the level ships compass and the leveldeadreckoning by log and by line THESE shall conduct me and showme my place on the sea  Aye lighting from the boat to the deckthus I trample on thee thou paltry thing that feebly pointest onhigh thus I split and destroy theeAs the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live anddead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab and afatalistic despair that seemed meant for himselfthese passed overthe mute motionless Parsees face  Unobserved he rose and glidedaway while awestruck by the aspect of their commander the seamenclustered together on the forecastle till Ahab troubledly pacingthe deck shouted outTo the braces  Up helmsquare inIn an instant the yards swung round and as the ship halfwheeledupon her heel her three firmseated graceful masts erectly poisedupon her long ribbed hull seemed as the three Horatii pirouettingon one sufficient steedStanding between the knightheads Starbuck watched the Pequodstumultuous way and Ahabs also as he went lurching along the deckI have sat before the dense coal

thatin these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direstof all storms the Typhoon  It will sometimes burst from out thatcloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy townTowards evening of that day the Pequod was torn of her canvas andbarepoled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directlyahead  When darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with thethunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabledmasts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury ofthe tempest had left for its after sportHolding by a shroud Starbuck was standing on the quarterdeck atevery flash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what additionaldisaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there while Stubband Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmerlashing of the boats  But all their pains seemed naught  Thoughlifted to the very top of the cranes the windward quarter boatAhabs did not escape  A great rolling sea dashing high upagainst the reeling ships high teetering side stove in the boatsbottom at the stern and left it again all dripping through like asieveBad work bad work  Mr Starbuck said Stubb regarding the wreckbut the sea will have its way  Stubb for one cant fight it  Yousee Mr Starbuck a wave has such a great long start before itleaps all round the world it runs and then comes the spring  Butas for me all the start I have to meet it is just across the deckhere  But never mind its all in fun so the old songsaysSINGSOh jolly is the galeAnd a joker is the whaleA flourishin his

strike hisharp here in our rigging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt holdthy peaceBut I am not a brave man never said I was a brave man I am acoward and I sing to keep up my spirits  And I tell you what it isMr Starbuck theres no way to stop my singing in this world but tocut my throat  And when thats done ten to one I sing ye thedoxology for a windupMadman look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine ownWhat how can you see better of a dark night than anybody elsenever mind how foolishHere cried Starbuck seizing Stubb by the shoulder and pointinghis hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the galecomes from the eastward the very course Ahab is to run for MobyDick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boatthere where is that stove  In the sternsheets man where he iswont to standhis standpoint is stove man  Now jump overboardand sing away if thou mustI dont half understand ye whats in the windYes yes round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way toNantucket soliloquized Starbuck suddenly heedless of Stubbsquestion  The gale that now hammers at us to stave us we can turnit into a fair wind that will drive us towards home  Yonder towindward all is blackness of doom but to leeward homewardI seeit lightens up there but not with the lightningAt that moment in one of the intervals of profound darknessfollowing the flashes a voice was heard at his side and almost atthe same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overheadWhos thereOld Thunder said Ahab groping his way along the bulwarks to hispivothole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him byelbowed lances of fireNow as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carryoff the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at seasome ships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into thewater  But as this conductor must descend to considerable depththat its end may avoid all contact with the hull and as moreover ifkept constantly towing there it would be liable to many mishapsbesides interfering not a little with some of the rigging and moreor less impeding the vessels way in the water because of all thisthe lower parts of a ships lightningrods are not always overboardbut are generally made in long slender links so as to be the morereadily hauled up into the chains outside or thrown down into thesea as occasion may requireThe rods the rods cried Starbuck to the crew suddenly admonishedto vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been dartingflambeaux to light Ahab to his post  Are they overboard drop themover fore and aft  QuickAvast cried Ahab lets have fair play here though we be theweaker side  Yet Ill contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs andAndes that all the world may be secured but out on privileges  Letthem be sirLook aloft cried Starbuck  The corpusants the corpusantsAll the yardarms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at eachtripointed lightningrodend with three tapering white flames eachof the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous airlike three gigantic wax tapers before an altarBlast the boat let it go cried Stubb at this instant as aswashing sea heaved up under his own little craft so that itsgunwale violently jammed his hand as he was passing a lashingBlast itbut slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eyescaught the flames and immediately shifting his tone he criedThecorpusants have mercy on us allTo sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the tranceof the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecatecurses from the topsailyardarms when most they teeter over to aseething sea but in all my voyagings seldom have I heard a commonoath when Gods burning finger has been laid on the ship when HisMene Mene Tekel Upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and thecordageWhile this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard fromthe enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastleall their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a far awayconstellation of stars  Relieved against the ghostly light thegigantic jet negro Daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature andseemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come  The partedmouth of Tashtego revealed his sharkwhite teeth which strangelygleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up bythe preternatural light Queequegs tattooing burned like Satanicblue flames on his bodyThe tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and oncemore the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pallA moment or two passed when Starbuck going forward pushed againstsome one  It was Stubb  What thinkest thou now man I heard thycry it was not the same in the songNo no it wasnt I said the corpusants have mercy on us all and Ihope they will still  But do they only have mercy on longfaceshave they no bowels for a laugh  And look ye MrStarbuckbut its too dark to look  Hear me then I take thatmasthead flame we saw for a sign of good luck for those masts arerooted in a hold that is going to be chock a block with spermoildye see and so all that sperm will work up into the masts likesap in a tree  Yes our three masts will yet be as three spermaceticandlesthats the good promise we sawAt that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubbs face slowly beginningto glimmer into sight  Glancing upwards he cried See see andonce more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemedredoubled supernaturalness in their pallorThe corpusants have mercy on us all cried Stubb againAt the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and theflame the Parsee was kneeling in Ahabs front but with his headbowed away from him while near by from the arched and overhangingrigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a numberof the seamen arrested by the glare now cohered together and hungpendulous like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twigIn various enchanted attitudes like the standing or stepping orrunning skeletons in Herculaneum others remained rooted to the deckbut all their eyes upcastAye aye men cried Ahab  Look up at it mark it well the whiteflame but lights the way to the White Whale  Hand me those mainmastlinks there I would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat againstit blood against fire  SoThen turningthe last link held fast in his left hand he put hisfoot upon the Parsee and with fixed upward eye and highflung rightarm he stood erect before the lofty tripointed trinity of flamesOh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these seas I as

panicstricken crew instantly ran to thebracesthough not a sail was left aloft  For the moment all theaghast mates thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinouscry  But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck andsnatching the burning harpoon Ahab waved it like a torch among themswearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose aropes end  Petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking fromthe fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and Ahabagain spokeAll your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine andheart soul and body lungs and

pound that knot there as much as you please butyou will never pound into me what you were just now saying  And howlong ago is it since you said the very contrary  Didnt you once saythat whatever ship Ahab sails in that ship should pay somethingextra on its insurance policy just as though it were loaded withpowder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward  Stop now didntyou say soWell suppose I did  What then  Ive part changed my flesh sincethat time why not my mind  Besides supposing we ARE loaded withpowder barrels aft and lucifers forward how the devil could thelucifers get afire in this

see then that for theseextra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guaranteesHere are hydrants Flask  But hark again and Ill answer ye theother thing  First take your leg off from the crown of the anchorhere though so I can pass the rope now listen  Whats the mightydifference between holding a masts lightningrod in the storm andstanding close by a mast that hasnt got any lightningrod at all ina storm  Dont you see you timberhead that no harm can come tothe holder of the rod unless the mast is first struck  What are youtalking about then  Not one ship in a hundred carries rods andAhabaye man and all of uswere in no more danger then in mypoor opinion than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailingthe seas  Why you KingPost you I suppose you would have everyman in the

why dont ye then any man with half an eye canbe sensibleI dont know that Stubb  You sometimes find it rather hardYes when a fellows soaked through its hard to be sensiblethats a fact  And I am about

MusketDuring the most violent shocks of the Typhoon the man at thePequods jawbone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled tothe deck by its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles hadbeen attached to itfor they were slackbecause some play to thetiller was indispensableIn a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossedshuttlecock to the blast it is by no means uncommon to see theneedles in the compasses at intervals go round and round  It wasthus with the Pequods at almost every shock the helmsman had notfailed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved uponthe cards it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without somesort of unwonted emotionSome hours after midnight the Typhoon abated so much that throughthe strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubbone engaged forwardand the other aftthe shivered remnants of the jib and fore andmaintopsails were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying awayto leeward like the feathers of an albatross which sometimes arecast to the winds when that stormtossed bird is on the wingThe three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and astormtrysail was set further aft so that the ship soon went throughthe water with some precision again and the coursefor the presentEastsoutheastwhich he was to steer if practicable was once moregiven to the helmsman  For during the violence of the gale he hadonly steered according to its vicissitudes  But as he was nowbringing the ship as near her course as possible watching thecompass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed coming roundastern aye the foul breeze became fairInstantly the yards were squared to the lively song of HO THE FAIRWIND OHYEHO CHEERLY MEN the crew singing for joy that sopromising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portentspreceding itIn compliance with the standing order of his commanderto reportimmediately and at any one of the twentyfour hours any decidedchange in the affairs of the deckStarbuck had no sooner trimmedthe yards to the breezehowever reluctantly and gloomilythan hemechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstanceEre knocking at his stateroom he involuntarily paused before it amoment  The cabin lamptaking long swings this way and thatwasburning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the old mansbolted doora thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place ofupper panels  The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made acertain humming silence to reign there though it was hooped round byall the roar of the elements  The loaded muskets in the rack wereshiningly revealed as they stood upright against the forwardbulkhead  Starbuck was an honest upright man but out of Starbucksheart at that instant when he saw the muskets there strangelyevolved an evil thought but so blent with its neutral or goodaccompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itselfHe would have shot me once he murmured yes theres the verymusket that he pointed at methat one with the studded stock letme touch itlift it  Strange that I who have handled so manydeadly lances strange that I should shake so now  Loaded  I mustsee  Aye aye and powder in the panthats not good  Best

fair for that accursed fishThe very tube hepointed at methe very one THIS oneI hold it here he would havekilled me with the very thing I handle nowAye and he would fainkill all his crew  Does he not say he will not strike his spars toany gale  Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these sameperilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of theerrorabounding log and in this very Typhoon did he not swear thathe would have no lightningrods  But shall this crazed old man betamely suffered to drag a whole ships company down to doom withhimYes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men andmore if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harmmy soul swears this ship will if Ahab have his way  If then hewere this instantput aside that crime would not be his  Ha is hemuttering in his sleep  Yes just therein there hes sleepingSleeping aye but still alive and soon awake again  I cantwithstand thee then old man  Not reasoning not remonstrance

even knotted all over with ropes and hawserschained down to ringbolts on this cabin floor he would be morehideous than a caged tiger then  I could not endure the sightcould not possibly fly his

upon an open sea withtwo oceans and a whole continent between me and lawAye aye tissoIs heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a wouldbemurderer in his bed tindering sheets and skin togetherAnd would Ibe a murderer then ifand slowly stealthily and half sidewayslooking he placed the loaded muskets end against the doorOn this level Ahabs hammock swings within his head this way  Atouch and

crew  Great God where art Thou  ShallI shall IThe wind has gone down and shifted sir the fore andmain topsails are reefed and set she heads her courseStern all  Oh Moby Dick I clutch thy heart at lastSuch were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old manstormented sleep as if Starbucks voice had caused the long dumbdream to speakThe yet levelled musket shook like a drunkards arm against thepanel Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from thedoor he placed the deathtube in its rack and left the placeHes too sound asleep Mr Stubb go thou down and wake him andtell him  I must see to the deck here  Thou knowst what to sayCHAPTER 124The NeedleNext morning the notyetsubsided sea rolled in long slow billows ofmighty bulk and striving in the Pequods gurgling track pushed heron like giants palms outspread  The strong unstaggering breezeabounded so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails thewhole world boomed before the wind  Muffled in the full morninglight the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity ofhis place where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks  Emblazoningsas of crowned Babylonian kings and queens reigned over everythingThe sea was as a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leaps withlight and heatLong maintaining an enchanted silence Ahab stood apart and everytime the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit heturned to eye the bright suns rays produced ahead and when sheprofoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the sunsrearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with hisundeviating wakeHa ha my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the seachariotof the sun  Ho ho all ye nations before my prow I bring the sunto ye  Yoke on the further billows hallo a tandem I drive theseaBut suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towardsthe helm huskily demanding how the ship was headingEastsoueast sir said the frightened steersmanThou liest smiting him with his clenched fist  Heading East atthis hour in the morning and the sun asternUpon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just thenobserved by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but itsvery blinding palpableness must have been the causeThrusting his head half way into the binnacle Ahab caught oneglimpse of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a momenthe almost seemed to stagger  Standing behind him Starbuck lookedand lo the two compasses pointed East and the Pequod was asinfallibly going WestBut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew theold man with a rigid laugh exclaimed I have it  It has happenedbefore  Mr Starbuck last nights thunder turned ourcompassesthats all  Thou hast before now heard of such a thing Itake itAye but never before has it happened to me sir said the palemate gloomilyHere it must needs be said that accidents like this have in morethan one case occurred to ships in violent storms  The magneticenergy as developed in the mariners needle is as all knowessentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it isnot to be much marvelled at that such things should be  Instanceswhere the lightning has actually struck the vessel so as to smitedown some of the spars and rigging the effect upon the needle has attimes been still more fatal all its loadstone virtue beingannihilated so that the before magnetic steel was of no more usethan an old wifes knitting needle  But in either case the needlenever again of itself recovers the original virtue thus marred orlost and if the binnacle compasses be affected the same fatereaches all the others that may be in the ship even were thelowermost one inserted into the kelsonDeliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing thetranspointed compasses the old man with the sharp of his extendedhand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that theneedles were exactly inverted shouted out his orders for the shipscourse to be changed accordingly  The yards were hard up and oncemore the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind forthe supposed fair one had only been juggling herMeanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts Starbuck saidnothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while Stubb andFlaskwho in some small degree seemed then to be sharing hisfeelingslikewise unmurmuringly acquiesced  As for the men thoughsome of them lowly rumbled their fear of Ahab was greater than theirfear of Fate  But as ever before the pagan harpooneers remainedalmost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with acertain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexibleAhabsFor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries  Butchancing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed coppersighttubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deckThou poor proud heavengazer and suns pilot yesterday I wreckedthee and today the compasses would fain have wrecked me  So soBut Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet  Mr Starbucka lancewithout a pole a topmaul and the smallest of the sailmakersneedles  QuickAccessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was nowabout to do were certain prudential motives whose object might havebeen to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtileskill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compassesBesides the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needlesthough clumsily practicable was not a thing to be passed over bysuperstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portentsMen said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handedhim the things he had demanded my men the thunder turned oldAhabs needles but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of hisown that will point as true as anyAbashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors asthis was said and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magicmight follow  But Starbuck looked awayWith a blow from the topmaul Ahab knocked off the steel head of thelance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining badehim hold it upright without its touching the deck  Then with themaul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod heplaced the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less stronglyhammered that several times the mate still holding the rod asbefore  Then going through some small strange motions withitwhether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merelyintended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertainhe called forlinen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped out the tworeversed needles there and horizontally suspended the sailneedle byits middle over one of the compasscards  At first the steel wentround and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at lastit settled to its place when Ahab who had been intently watchingfor this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointinghis stretched arm towards it exclaimedLook ye for yourselvesif Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone  The sun is East andthat compass swears itOne after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyescould persuade such ignorance as theirs and one after another theyslunk awayIn his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph you then saw Ahab in all hisfatal prideCHAPTER 125The Log and LineWhile now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage thelog and line had but very seldom been in use  Owing to a confidentreliance upon other means of determining the vessels place somemerchantmen and many whalemen especially when cruising whollyneglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequentlymore for forms sake than anything else regularly putting down uponthe customary slate the course steered by the ship as well as thepresumed average rate of progression every hour  It had been thuswith the Pequod  The wooden reel and angular log attached hung longuntouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks  Rains andspray had damped it sun and wind had warped it all the elementshad combined to rot a thing that hung so idly  But heedless of allthis his mood seized Ahab as he happened to glance upon the reelnot many hours after the magnet scene and he remembered how hisquadrant was no more and recalled his frantic oath about the levellog and line  The ship was sailing plungingly astern the billowsrolled in riotsForward there  Heave the logTwo seamen came  The goldenhued Tahitian and the grizzly ManxmanTake the reel one of ye Ill heaveThey went towards the extreme stern on the ships lee side wherethe deck with the oblique energy of the wind was now almost dippinginto the creamy sidelongrushing seaThe Manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projectinghandleends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolvedso stood with the angular log hanging downwards till Ahab advancedto himAhab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or fortyturns to form a preliminary handcoil to toss overboard when the oldManxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold tospeakSir I mistrust it

now southeastward by Ahabs levelled steel and herprogress solely determined by Ahabs level log and line the Pequodheld on her path towards the Equator  Making so long a passagethrough such unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere longsideways impelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonouslymild all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotousand desperate sceneAt last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of theEquatorial fishingground and in the deep darkness that goes beforethe dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watchthenheaded by Flaskwas startled by a cry so plaintively wild andunearthlylike halfarticulated wailings of the ghosts of allHerods murdered Innocentsthat one and all they started from theirreveries and for the space of some moments stood or sat or leanedall transfixedly listening like the carved Roman slave while thatwild cry remained within hearing  The Christian or civilized part ofthe crew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the paganharpooneers remained unappalled  Yet the grey Manxmanthe oldestmariner of alldeclared that the wild thrilling sounds that wereheard were the voices of newly drowned men in the seaBelow in his hammock Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn whenhe came to the deck it was then recounted to him by Flask notunaccompanied with hinted dark meanings  He hollowly laughed andthus explained the wonderThose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of greatnumbers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams orsome dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship andkept company with her crying and sobbing with their human sort ofwail  But this only the more affected some of them because mostmariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arisingnot only from their peculiar tones when in distress but also fromthe human look of their round heads and semiintelligent faces seenpeeringly uprising from the water alongside  In the sea undercertain circumstances seals have more than once been mistaken formenBut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausibleconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning  Atsunrise this man went from his hammock to his masthead at the foreand whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep forsailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it wasthus with the man there is now no telling but be that as it mayhe had not been long at his perch when a cry was hearda cry and arushingand looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air andlooking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue ofthe seaThe lifebuoya long slender caskwas dropped from the stern whereit always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose toseize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it hadshrunken so that it slowly filled and that parched wood alsofilled at its every pore and the studded ironbound cask followedthe sailor to the bottom as if to yield him his pillow though insooth but a hard oneAnd thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to lookout for the White Whale on the White Whales own peculiar groundthat man was swallowed up in the deep  But few perhaps thought ofthat at the time  Indeed in some sort they were not grieved atthis event at least as a portent for they regarded it not as aforeshadowing of evil in the future but as the fulfilment of anevil already presaged  They declared that now they knew the reasonof those wild shrieks they had heard the night before  But again theold Manxman said nayThe lost lifebuoy was now to be replaced Starbuck was directed tosee to it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found andas in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis ofthe voyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what wasdirectly connected with its final end whatever that might prove tobe therefore they were going to leave the ships stern unprovidedwith a buoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeghinted a hint concerning his coffinA lifebuoy of a coffin cried Starbuck startingRather queer that I should say said StubbIt will make a good enough one said Flask the carpenter here canarrange it easilyBring it up theres nothing else for it said Starbuck after amelancholy pause  Rig it carpenter do not look at me sothecoffin I mean  Dost thou hear me  Rig itAnd shall I nail down the lid sir moving his hand as with ahammerAyeAnd shall I caulk the seams sir moving his

Flask come forward with meHe goes off in a huff  The whole he can endure at the parts hebaulks  Now I dont like this  I make a leg for Captain Ahab andhe wears it like a gentleman but I make a bandbox for Queequeg andhe wont put his head into it  Are all my pains to go for nothingwith that coffin  And now Im ordered to make a lifebuoy of itIts like turning an old coat going to bring the flesh on

with men  Atthe time the Pequod was making good speed through the water but asthe broadwinged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastfulsails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst and alllife fled from the smitten hullBad news she brings bad news muttered the old Manxman  But ereher commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in his boat erehe could hopefully hail Ahabs voice was heardHast seen the White WhaleAye yesterday  Have ye seen a whaleboat adriftThrottling his joy Ahab negatively answered this unexpectedquestion and would then have fain boarded the stranger when thestranger captain himself having stopped his vessels way was seendescending her side  A few keen pulls and his boathook soonclinched the Pequods mainchains and he sprang to the deckImmediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew  Butno formal salutation was exchangedWhere was henot killednot killed cried Ahab closelyadvancing  How was itIt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previouswhile three of the strangers boats were engaged with a shoal ofwhales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship andwhile they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump andhead of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water not veryfar to leeward whereupon the fourth rigged boata reservedonehad been instantly lowered in chase  After a keen sail beforethe wind this fourth boatthe swiftest keeled of allseemed tohave succeeded in fasteningat least as well as the man at themasthead could tell anything about it  In the distance he saw thediminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling whitewater and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that thestricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers asoften happens  There was some apprehension but no positive alarmas yet  The recall signals were placed in the rigging darkness cameon and forced to pick up her three far to windward boatsere goingin quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite directiontheship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fatetill near midnight but for the time to increase her distance fromit  But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowdedall sailstunsail on stunsailafter the missing boat kindling afire in her trypots for a beacon and every other man aloft on thelookout  But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distanceto gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen thoughshe then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her andnot finding anything had again dashed on again paused and loweredher boats and though she had thus continued doing till daylightyet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seenThe story told the stranger Captain immediately went on to revealhis object in boarding the Pequod  He desired that ship to unitewith his own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or fivemiles apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon asit wereI will wager something now whispered Stubb to Flask that someone in that missing boat wore off that Captains best coat mayhaphis watchhes so cursed anxious to get it back  Who ever heard oftwo pious whaleships cruising after one missing whaleboat in theheight of the whaling season  See Flask only see how pale helookspale in the very buttons of his eyeslookit wasnt thecoatit must have been theMy boy my own boy is among them  For Gods sakeI beg Iconjurehere exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab who thus farhad but icily received his petition  For eightandforty hours letme charter your shipI will gladly pay for it and roundly pay foritif there be no other wayfor eightandforty hours onlyonlythatyou must oh you must and you SHALL do this thingHis son cried Stubb oh its his son hes lost  I take back thecoat and watchwhat says Ahab  We must save that boyHes drowned with the rest on em last night said the old Manxsailor standing behind them I heard all of ye heard theirspiritsNow as it shortly turned out what made this incident of theRachels the more melancholy was the circumstance that not only wasone of the Captains sons among the number of the missing boatscrew but among the number of the other boats crews at the sametime but on the other hand separated from the ship during the darkvicissitudes of the chase there had been still another son as thatfor a time the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of thecruellest perplexity which was only solved for him by his chiefmates instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whaleshipin such emergencies that is when placed between jeopardized butdivided boats always to pick up the majority first  But thecaptain for some unknown constitutional reason had refrained frommentioning all this and not till forced to it by Ahabs iciness didhe allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad but twelve yearsold whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of aNantucketers paternal love had thus early sought to initiate him inthe perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destinyof all his race  Nor does it unfrequently occur that Nantucketcaptains will send a son of such tender age away from them for aprotracted three or four years voyage in some other ship than theirown so that their first knowledge of a whalemans career shall beunenervated by any chance display of a fathers natural but untimelypartiality or undue apprehensiveness and concernMeantime now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon ofAhab and Ahab still stood like an anvil receiving every shock butwithout the least quivering of his ownI will not go said the stranger till you say aye to me  Do tome as you would have me do to you in the like case  For YOU too havea boy Captain Ahabthough but a child and nestling safely at homenowa child of your old age tooYes yes you relent I seeitrun run men now and stand by to square in the yardsAvast cried Ahabtouch not a ropeyarn then in a voice thatprolongingly moulded every wordCaptain Gardiner I will not do itEven now I lose time  Goodbye goodbye  God bless ye man andmay I forgive myself but I must go  Mr Starbuck look at thebinnacle watch and in three minutes from this present instant warnoff all strangers then brace forward again and let the ship sailas beforeHurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabinleaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional andutter rejection of his so earnest suit  But starting from hisenchantment Gardiner silently hurried to the side more fell thanstepped into his boat and returned to his shipSoon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strangevessel was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thither at everydark spot however small on the sea  This way and that her yardswere swung round starboard and larboard she continued to tacknow she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her before itwhile all the while her masts and yards were thickly clustered withmen as three tall cherry trees when the boys are cherrying amongthe boughsBut by her still halting course and winding woeful way you plainlysaw that this ship that so wept with spray still remained withoutcomfort  She was Rachel weeping for her children because they werenotCHAPTER 129The CabinAHAB

to slay him the more securelythere now that he found himself hard by the very latitude andlongitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that avessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actuallyencountered Moby Dickand now that all his successive meetings withvarious ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniacindifference with which the white whale tore his hunters whethersinning or sinned against now it was that there lurked a somethingin the old mans eyes which it was hardly sufferable for feeblesouls to see  As the unsetting polar star which through thelivelong arctic six months night sustains its piercing steadycentral gaze so Ahabs purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon theconstant midnight of the gloomy crew  It domineered above them sothat all their bodings doubts misgivings fears were fain to hidebeneath their souls and not sprout forth a single spear or leafIn this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or naturalvanished  Stubb no more strove to raise a smile Starbuck no morestrove to check one  Alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemedground to finest dust and powdered for the time in the clampedmortar of Ahabs iron soul  Like machines they dumbly moved aboutthe deck ever conscious that the old mans despot eye was on themBut did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hourswhen he thought no glance but one was on him then you would haveseen that even as Ahabs eyes so awed the crews the inscrutableParsees glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way attimes affected it  Such an added gliding strangeness began toinvest the thin Fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook himthat the men looked dubious at him half uncertain as it seemedwhether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadowcast upon the deck by some unseen beings body  And that shadow wasalways hovering there  For not by night even had Fedallah evercertainly been known to slumber or go below  He would stand stillfor hours but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eyes didplainly sayWe two watchmen never restNor at any time by night or day could the mariners now step uponthe deck unless Ahab was before them either standing in hispivothole or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviatinglimitsthe mainmast and the mizen or else they saw him standingin the cabinscuttlehis living foot advanced upon the deck as ifto step his hat slouched heavily over his eyes so that howevermotionless he stood however the days and nights were added on thathe had not swung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouchinghat they could never tell unerringly whether for all this his eyeswere really closed at times or whether he was still intentlyscanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for awhole hour on the stretch and the unheeded nightdamp gathered inbeads of dew upon that stonecarved coat and hat  The clothes thatthe night had wet the next days sunshine dried upon him and soday after day and night after night he went no more beneath theplanks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent forHe ate in the same open air that is his two only mealsbreakfastand dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard whichdarkly grew all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown overwhich still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upperverdure  But though his whole life was now become one watch on deckand though the Parsees mystic watch was without intermission as hisown yet these two never seemed to speakone man to theotherunless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter madeit necessary  Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join thetwain openly and to the awestruck crew they seemed polelikeasunder  If by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumbmen were both so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchangeAt times for longest hours without a single hail they stood farparted in the starlight Ahab in his scuttle the Parsee by themainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in theParsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow in Ahab the Parsee hisabandoned substanceAnd yet somehow did Ahabin his own proper self as daily hourlyand every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinatesAhabseemed an independent lord the Parsee but his slave  Still againboth seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them thelean shade siding the solid rib  For be this Parsee what he may allrib and keel was solid AhabAt the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice washeard from aftMan the mastheadsand all through the daytill after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour atthe striking of the helmsmans bell was heardWhat dyeseesharp sharpBut when three or four days had slided by after meeting thechildrenseeking Rachel and no spout had yet been seen themonomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crews fidelity atleast of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers he seemed todoubt even whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook thesight he sought  But if these suspicions were really his hesagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them however hisactions might seem to hint themI will have the first sight of the whale myselfhe said  AyeAhab must have the doubloon and with his own hands he rigged a nestof basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheavedblock to secure to the mainmast head he received the two ends ofthe downwardreeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared apin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail  This donewith that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he lookedround upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing hisglance long upon Daggoo Queequeg Tashtego but shunning Fedallahand then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief matesaidTake the rope sirI give it into thy hands StarbuckThen arranging his person in the basket he gave the word for them tohoist him to his perch Starbuck being the one who secured the ropeat last and afterwards stood near it  And thus with one handclinging round the royal mast Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea formiles and milesahead astern this side and thatwithin thewide expanded circle commanded at so great a heightWhen in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place inthe rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at seais hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope underthese circumstances its fastened end on deck is always given instrict charge to some one man who has the special watch of itBecause in such a wilderness of running rigging whose variousdifferent relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned bywhat is seen of them at the deck and when the deckends of theseropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings itwould be but a natural fatality if unprovided with a constantwatchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crewbe cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea  So Ahabsproceedings in this matter were not unusual the only strange thingabout them seemed to be that Starbuck almost the one only man whohad ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degreeapproaching to decisionone of those too whose faithfulness on thelookout he had seemed to doubt somewhatit was strange that thiswas the very man he should select for his watchman freely giving hiswhole life into such an otherwise distrusted persons handsNow the first time Ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there tenminutes one of those redbilled savage seahawks which so often flyincommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in theselatitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round hishead in a maze of untrackably swift circlings  Then it darted athousand feet straight up into the air then spiralized downwardsand went eddying again round his headBut with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon Ahab seemednot to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else havemarked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almostthe least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning inalmost every sightYour hat your hat sir suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman whobeing posted at the mizenmasthead stood directly behind Ahabthough somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of airdividing themBut already the sable wing was before the old mans eyes the longhooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk darted awaywith his prizeAn eagle flew thrice round Tarquins head removing his cap toreplace it and thereupon Tanaquil his wife declared that Tarquinwould be king of Rome  But only by the replacing of the cap was thatomen accounted good  Ahabs hat was never restored the wild hawkflew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at lastdisappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minuteblack spot was dimly discerned falling from that vast height intothe seaCHAPTER 131The Pequod Meets The DelightThe intense Pequod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by thelifebuoycoffin still lightly swung and another ship mostmiserably misnamed the Delight was descried  As she drew nigh alleyes were fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in somewhalingships cross the quarterdeck at the height of eight or ninefeet serving to carry the spare unrigged or disabled boatsUpon the strangers shears were beheld the shattered white ribs andsome few splintered planks of what had once been a whaleboat butyou now saw through this wreck as plainly as you see through thepeeled halfunhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horseHast seen the White WhaleLook replied the hollowcheeked captain from his taffrail andwith his trumpet he pointed to the wreckHast killed himThe harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that answered theother sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck whosegathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing togetherNot forged and snatching Perths levelled iron from the crotchAhab held it out exclaimingLook ye Nantucketer here in thishand I hold his death  Tempered in blood and tempered by lightningare these barbs and I swear to temper them triply in that hot placebehind the fin where the White Whale most feels his accursed lifeThen God keep thee old manseest thou thatpointing to thehammockI bury but one of five stout men who were alive onlyyesterday but were dead ere night  Only THAT one I bury the restwere buried before they died you sail upon their tomb  Thenturning to his crewAre ye ready there place the plank then on therail and lift the body so thenOh  Godadvancing towards thehammock with uplifted handsmay the resurrection and the lifeBrace forward  Up helm cried Ahab like lightning to his menBut the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape thesound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the seanot so quick indeed but that some of the flying bubbles might havesprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptismAs Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight the strange lifebuoyhanging at the Pequods stern came into conspicuous reliefHa yonder look yonder men cried a foreboding voice in her wakeIn vain oh ye strangers ye fly our sad burial ye but turn usyour taffrail to show us your coffinCHAPTER 132The SymphonyIt was a clear steelblue day  The firmaments of air and sea werehardly separable in that allpervading azure only the pensive airwas transparently pure and soft with a womans look and the robustand manlike sea heaved with long strong lingering swells asSamsons chest in his sleepHither and thither on high glided the snowwhite wings of smallunspeckled birds these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine airbut to and fro in the deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushedmighty leviathans swordfish and sharks and these were the strongtroubled murderous thinkings of the masculine seaBut though thus contrasting within the contrast was only in shadesand shadows without those two seemed one it was only the sex as itwere that distinguished themAloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentleair to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom  And at thegirdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motionmost seenhere at the Equatordenoted the fond throbbing trust the lovingalarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom awayTied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardlyfirm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow inthe ashes of ruin untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness ofthe morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girlsforehead of heavenOh immortal infancy and innocency of the

to gaze over on the other side but started attwo reflected fixed eyes in the water there  Fedallah wasmotionlessly leaning over the same railCHAPTER 133The ChaseFirst DayThat night in the midwatch when the old manas his wont atintervalsstepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned andwent to his pivothole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercelysnuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ships dog will in drawingnigh to some barbarous isle  He declared that a whale must be nearSoon that peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth bythe living sperm whale was palpable to all the watch nor was anymariner surprised when after inspecting the compass and then thedogvane and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor asnearly as possible Ahab rapidly ordered the ships course to beslightly altered and the sail to be shortenedThe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficientlyvindicated at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the seadirectly and lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in thepleated watery wrinkles bordering it the polished metalliclikemarks of some swift tiderip at the mouth of a deep rapid streamMan the mastheads  Call all handsThundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on theforecastle deck Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment clapsthat they seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously didthey appear with their clothes in their handsWhat dye see cried Ahab flattening his face to the skyNothing nothing sir was the sound hailing down in replyTgallant sailsstunsails alow and aloft and on both sidesAll sail being set he now cast loose the lifeline reserved forswaying him to the main royalmast head and in a few moments theywere hoisting him thither when while but two thirds of the wayaloft and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy betweenthe maintopsail and topgallantsail he raised a gulllike cry inthe air  There she blowsthere she blows  A hump like asnowhill  It is Moby DickFired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the threelookouts the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famouswhale they had so long been pursuing  Ahab had now gained his finalperch some feet above the other lookouts Tashtego standing justbeneath him on the cap of the topgallantmast so that the Indianshead was almost on a level with Ahabs heel  From this height thewhale was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the searevealing his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silentspout into the air  To the credulous mariners it seemed the samesilent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic andIndian OceansAnd did none of ye see it before cried Ahab hailing the perchedmen all around himI saw him almost that same instant sir that Captain Ahab did andI cried out said TashtegoNot the same instant not the sameno the doubloon is mine Fatereserved the doubloon for me  I only none of ye could have raisedthe White Whale

awayfrom us cannot have seen the ship yetBe dumb man  Stand by the braces  Hard down the helmbrace upShiver hershiver herSo well that  Boats boatsSoon all the boats but Starbucks were dropped all the boatsailssetall the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting toleeward and Ahab heading the onset  A pale deathglimmer lit upFedallahs sunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouthLike noiseless nautilus shells their light prows sped through thesea but only slowly they neared the foe  As they neared him theocean grew still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over its wavesseemed a noonmeadow so serenely it spread  At length thebreathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that hisentire dazzling hump was distinctly visible sliding along the sea asif an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring offinest fleecy greenish foam  He saw the vast involved wrinkles ofthe slightly projecting head beyond  Before it far out on the softTurkishrugged waters went the glistening white shadow from hisbroad milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying theshade and behind the blue waters interchangeably flowed over intothe moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand brightbubbles arose and danced by his side  But these were broken again bythe light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the seaalternate with their fitful flight and like to some flagstaffrising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but shatteredpole of a recent lance projected from the white whales back and atintervals one of the cloud of softtoed fowls hovering and to andfro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perched and rockedon this pole the long tail feathers streaming like pennonsA gentle joyousnessa mighty mildness of repose in swiftnessinvested the gliding whale  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming awaywith ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovelyleering eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitchingfleetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete notJove not that great majesty Supreme did surpass the glorified WhiteWhale as he so divinely swamOn each soft sidecoincident with the parted swell that but onceleaving him then flowed so wide awayon each bright side the whaleshed off enticings  No wonder there had been some among the hunterswho namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity hadventured to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but thevesture of tornadoes  Yet calm enticing calm oh whale thouglidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no matter howmany in that same way thou mayst have bejuggled and destroyedbeforeAnd thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical seaamong waves whose handclappings were suspended by exceeding raptureMoby Dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors ofhis submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of hisjaw  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water foran instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch likeVirginias Natural Bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukesin the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and went out ofsight  Hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the whiteseafowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he leftWith oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adriftthe three boats now stilly floated awaiting Moby DicksreappearanceAn hour said Ahab standing rooted in his boats stern and hegazed beyond the whales place towards the dim blue spaces and widewooing vacancies to leeward  It was only an instant for again hiseyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circleThe breeze now freshened the sea began to swellThe birdsthe birds cried TashtegoIn long Indian file as when herons take wing the white birds werenow all flying towards Ahabs boat and when within a few yards beganfluttering over the water there wheeling round and round withjoyous expectant cries  Their vision was keener than mans Ahabcould discover no sign in the sea  But suddenly as he peered downand down into its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot nobigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising andmagnifying as it rose till it turned and then there were plainlyrevealed two long crooked rows of white glistening teeth floatingup from the undiscoverable bottom  It was Moby Dicks open mouth andscrolled jaw his vast shadowed bulk still half blending with theblue of the sea  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat likean opendoored marble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with hissteering oar Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendousapparition  Then calling upon Fedallah to change places with himwent forward to the bows and seizing Perths harpoon commanded hiscrew to grasp their oars and stand by to sternNow by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axisits bow by anticipation was made to face the whales head while yetunder water  But as if perceiving this stratagem Moby Dick withthat malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplantedhimself as it were in an instant shooting his pleated headlengthwise beneath the boatThrough and through through every plank and each rib it thrilledfor an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the mannerof a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full withinhis mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled highup into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock  Thebluish pearlwhite of the inside of the jaw was within six inches ofAhabs head and reached higher than that  In this attitude theWhite Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat hermouse  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed and crossed his armsbut the tigeryellow crew were tumbling over each others heads togain the uttermost sternAnd now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out asthe whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way andfrom his body being submerged beneath the boat he could not bedarted at from the bows for the bows were almost inside of him asit were and while the other boats involuntarily paused as before aquick crisis impossible to withstand then it was that monomaniacAhab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placedhim all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied withall this he seized the long bone with his naked hands and wildlystrove to wrench it from its gripe  As now he thus vainly strovethe jaw slipped from him the frail gunwales bent in collapsed andsnapped as both jaws like an enormous shears sliding further aftbit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast againin the sea midway between the two floating wrecks  These floatedaside the broken ends drooping the crew at the sternwreck clingingto the gunwales and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash themacrossAt that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped Ahab thefirst to perceive the whales intent by the crafty upraising of hishead a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that momenthis hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the biteBut only slipping further into the whales mouth and tilting oversideways as it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jawspilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fellflatfaced upon the seaRipplingly withdrawing from his prey Moby Dick now lay at a littledistance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down inthe billows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindledbody so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rosesome twenty ormore feet out of the waterthe now rising swells with all theirconfluent waves dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossingtheir shivered spray still higher into the air  So in a gale thebut half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of theEddystone triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scudThis motion is peculiar to the sperm whale  It receives itsdesignation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminaryupanddown poise of the whalelance in the exercise calledpitchpoling previously described  By this motion the whale mustbest and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encirclinghimBut soon resuming his horizontal attitude Moby Dick swam swiftlyround and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in hisvengeful wake as if lashing himself up to still another and moredeadly assault  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to maddenhim as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochusselephants in the book of Maccabees  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered inthe foam of the whales insolent tail and too much of a cripple toswimthough he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such awhirlpool as that helpless Ahabs head was seen like a tossedbubble which the least chance shock might burst  From the boatsfragmentary stern Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him theclinging crew at the other drifting end could not succor him morethan enough was it for them to look to themselves  For sorevolvingly appalling was the White Whales aspect and soplanetarily swift the evercontracting circles he made that heseemed horizontally swooping upon them  And though the other boatsunharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into theeddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instantdestruction of the jeopardized castaways Ahab and all nor in thatcase could they themselves hope to escape  With straining eyesthen they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whosecentre had now become the old mans headMeantime from the beginning all this had been descried from theships mast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down uponthe scene and was now so nigh that Ahab in the water hailedherSail on thebut that moment a breaking sea dashed on himfrom Moby Dick and whelmed him for the time  But struggling out ofit again and chancing to rise on a towering crest heshoutedSail on the whaleDrive him offThe Pequods prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circleshe effectually parted the white whale from his victim  As hesullenly swam off the boats flew to the rescueDragged into Stubbs boat with bloodshot blinded eyes the whitebrine caking in his wrinkles the long tension of Ahabs bodilystrength did crack and helplessly he yielded to his bodys doom fora time lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubbs boat like onetrodden under foot of herds of elephants  Far inland nameless wailscame from him as desolate sounds from out ravinesBut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much themore abbreviate it  In an instants compass great hearts sometimescondense to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow painskindly diffused through feebler mens whole lives  And so suchhearts though summary in each one suffering still if the godsdecree it in their lifetime aggregate a whole age of woe whollymade up of instantaneous intensities for even in their pointlesscentres those noble natures contain the entire circumferences ofinferior soulsThe harpoon said Ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning onone bended armis it safeAye sir for it was not darted this is it said Stubb showingitLay it before meany missing menOne two three four fivethere were five oars sir and hereare five menThats goodHelp me man I wish to stand  So so I see himthere there going to leeward still what a leaping spoutHandsoff from me  The eternal sap runs up in Ahabs bones again  Set thesail out oars the helmIt is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew beingpicked up by another boat help to work that second boat and thechase is thus continued with what is called doublebanked oars  Itwas thus now  But the added power of the boat did not equal theadded power of the whale for he seemed to have treblebanked hisevery fin swimming with a velocity which plainly showed that ifnow under these circumstances pushed on the chase would prove anindefinitely prolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crewendure for so long a period such an unintermitted intense strainingat the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some one briefvicissitude  The ship itself then as it sometimes happens offeredthe most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chaseAccordingly the boats now made for her and were soon swayed up totheir cranesthe two parts of the wrecked boat having beenpreviously secured by herand then hoisting everything to her sideand stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching it withstunsails like the doublejointed wings of an albatross the Pequodbore down in the leeward wake of MobyDick  At the well knownmethodic intervals the whales glittering spout was regularlyannounced from the manned mastheads and when he would be reportedas just gone down Ahab would take the time and then pacing thedeck binnaclewatch in hand so soon as the last second of theallotted hour expired his voice was heardWhose is the doubloonnow  Dye see him and if the reply was No sir straightway hecommanded them to lift him to his perch  In this way the day woreon Ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing theplanksAs he was thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the menaloft or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one toa still greater breadththus to and fro pacing beneath his slouchedhat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had beendropped upon the quarterdeck and lay there reversed broken bow toshattered stern  At last he paused before it and as in an alreadyoverclouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail acrossso over the old mans face there now stole some such added gloom asthisStubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though toevince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant placein his Captains mind he advanced and eyeing the wreckexclaimedThe thistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth tookeenly sir ha haWhat soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck  Man mandid I not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical Icould swear thou wert a poltroon  Groan nor laugh should be heardbefore a wreckAye sir said Starbuck drawing near tis a solemn sight anomen and an ill oneOmen omenthe dictionary  If the gods think to speak outright toman they will honourably speak outright not shake their heads andgive an old wives darkling hintBegone  Ye two are the oppositepoles of one thing Starbuck is Stubb reversed and Stubb isStarbuck and ye two are all mankind and Ahab stands alone among themillions of the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neighbors  ColdcoldI shiverHow now  Aloft there  Dye see him  Sing out forevery spout though he spout ten times a secondThe day was nearly done only the hem of his golden robe wasrustling  Soon it was almost dark but the lookout men stillremained unsetCant see

We must not run over himbefore morning hes making a passage now and may heaveto a whileHelm there keep her full before the windAloft come downMrStubb send a fresh hand to the foremast head and see it

he placed himself half way within the scuttle andslouching his hat stood there till dawn except when at intervalsrousing himself to see how the night wore onCHAPTER 134The ChaseSecond DayAt daybreak the three mastheads were punctually manned afreshDye see him cried Ahab after allowing a little space for thelight to spreadSee nothing sirTurn up all hands and make sail he travels faster than I thoughtforthe topgallant sailsaye they should have been kept on herall night  But no mattertis but resting for the rushHere be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particularwhale continued through day into night and through night into dayis a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery  Forsuch is the wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincibleconfidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among theNantucket commanders that from the simple observation of a whalewhen last descried they will under certain given circumstancespretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he willcontinue to swim for a time while out of sight as well as hisprobable rate of progression during that period  And in thesecases somewhat as a pilot when about losing sight of a coast whosegeneral trending he well knows and which he desires shortly toreturn to again but at some further point like as this pilot standsby his compass and takes the precise bearing of the cape at presentvisible in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote unseenheadland eventually to be visited so does the fisherman at hiscompass with the whale for after being chased and diligentlymarked through several hours of daylight then when night obscuresthe fish the creatures future wake through the darkness is almostas established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the pilotscoast is to him  So that to this hunters wondrous skill theproverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to alldesired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land  And asthe mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarlyknown in its every pace that with watches in their hands men timehis rate as doctors that of a babys pulse and lightly say of itthe up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot atsuch or such an hour even so almost there are occasions when theseNantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep according to theobserved humor of his speed and say to themselves so many hourshence this whale will have gone two hundred miles will have aboutreached this or that degree of latitude or longitude  But to renderthis acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and the seamust be the whalemans allies for of what present avail to thebecalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he isexactly ninetythree leagues and a quarter from his port  Inferablefrom these statements are many collateral subtile matters touchingthe chase of whalesThe ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea as when acannonball missent becomes a ploughshare and turns up the levelfieldBy salt and hemp cried Stubb but this swift motion of the deckcreeps up ones legs and tingles at the heart  This ship and I aretwo brave fellowsHa ha  Some one take me up and launch mespinewise on the seafor by liveoaks my spines a keel  Haha we go the gait that leaves no dust behindThere she blowsshe blowsshe blowsright ahead was now themasthead cryAye aye cried Stubb I knew itye cant escapeblow on andsplit your spout O whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blowyour trumpblister your lungsAhab will dam off your blood as amiller shuts his watergate upon the streamAnd Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew  Thefrenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly uplike old wine worked anew  Whatever pale fears and forebodings someof them might have felt before these were not only now kept out ofsight through the growing awe of Ahab but they were broken up andon all sides routed as timid prairie hares that scatter before thebounding bison  The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls andby the stirring perils of the previous day the rack of the pastnights suspense the fixed unfearing blind reckless way in whichtheir wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark by all thesethings their hearts were bowled along  The wind that made greatbellies of their sails and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible asirresistible this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which soenslaved them to the raceThey were one man not thirty  For as the one ship that held themall though it was put together of all contrasting thingsoak andmaple and pine wood iron and pitch and hempyet all these raninto each other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way bothbalanced and directed by the long central keel even so all theindividualities of the crew this mans valor that mans fear guiltand guiltiness all varieties were welded into oneness and were alldirected to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel didpoint toThe rigging lived  The mastheads like the tops of tall palms wereoutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs  Clinging to a spar withone hand some reached forth the other with impatient wavingsothers shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight sat far out onthe rocking yards all the spars in full bearing of mortals readyand ripe for their fate  Ah how they still strove through thatinfinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy themWhy sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried Ahab when afterthe lapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had beenheard  Sway me up men ye have been deceived not Moby Dick castsone odd jet that way and then disappearsIt was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistakensome other thing for the whalespout as the event itself soonproved for hardly had Ahab reached his perch hardly was the ropebelayed to its pin on deck when he struck the keynote to anorchestra that made the air vibrate as with the combined dischargesof rifles  The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heardasmuch nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet lessthan a mile aheadMoby Dick bodily burst into view  For not by anycalm and indolent spoutings not by the peaceable gush of that mysticfountain in his head did the White Whale now reveal his vicinitybut by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching  Rising withhis utmost velocity from the furthest depths the Sperm Whale thusbooms his entire bulk into the pure element of air and piling up amountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the distance of sevenmiles and more  In those moments the torn enraged waves he shakesoff seem his mane in some cases this breaching is his act ofdefianceThere she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in hisimmeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmonlike toHeaven  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relievedagainst the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raisedfor the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier andstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparklingintensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a valeAye breach your last to the sun Moby Dick cried Ahab thy hourand thy harpoon are at handDown down all of ye but one man atthe fore  The boatsstand byUnmindful of the tedious ropeladders of the shrouds the men likeshooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstays andhalyards while Ahab less dartingly but still rapidly was droppedfrom his perchLower away he cried so soon as he had reached his boata spareone rigged the afternoon previous  Mr Starbuck the ship isthinekeep away from the boats but keep near them  Lower allAs if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being thefirst assailant himself Moby Dick had turned and was now coming forthe three crews  Ahabs boat was central and cheering his men hetold them he would take the whale headandheadthat is pullstraight up to his foreheada not uncommon thing for when within acertain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from thewhales sidelong vision  But ere that close limit was gained andwhile yet all three boats were plain as the ships three masts to hiseye the White Whale churning himself into furious speed almost inan instant as it were rushing among the boats with open jaws and alashing tail offered appalling battle on every side and heedless ofthe irons darted at him from every boat seemed only intent onannihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made  Butskilfully manoeuvred incessantly wheeling like trained chargers inthe field the boats for a while eluded him though at times but bya planks breadth while all the time Ahabs unearthly slogan toreevery other cry but his to shredsBut at last in his untraceable evolutions the White Whale so crossedand recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of thethree lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and ofthemselves warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons inhim though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little as if torally for a more tremendous charge  Seizing that opportunity Ahabfirst paid out more line and then was rapidly hauling and jerkingin upon it againhoping that way to disencumber it of somesnarlswhen loa sight more savage than the embattled teeth ofsharksCaught and twistedcorkscrewed in the mazes of the line looseharpoons and lances with all their bristling barbs and points cameflashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahabs boatOnly one thing could be done  Seizing the boatknife he criticallyreached withinthroughand then withoutthe rays of steeldragged in the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman andthen twice sundering the rope near the chocksdropped theintercepted fagot of steel into the sea and was all fast againThat instant the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remainingtangles of the other lines by so doing irresistibly dragged themore involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes dashedthem together like two rolling husks on a surfbeaten beach andthen diving down into the sea disappeared in a boiling maelstromin which for a space the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks dancedround and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl ofpunchWhile the two crews were yet

dreaded jaws of sharks andStubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up and whilethe old mans linenow partingadmitted of his pulling into thecreamy pool to rescue whom he couldin that wild simultaneousnessof a thousand concreted perilsAhabs yet unstricken boat seemeddrawn up towards Heaven by invisible wiresas arrowlike shootingperpendicularly from the sea the White Whale dashed his broadforehead against its bottom and sent it turning over and over intothe air till it fell againgunwale downwardsand Ahab and his menstruggled out from under it like seals from a seaside caveThe first uprising momentum of the whalemodifying its direction ashe struck the surfaceinvoluntarily launched him along it to alittle distance from the centre of the destruction he had made andwith his back to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with hisflukes from side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank theleast chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swiftlydrew back and came sideways smiting the sea  But soon as ifsatisfied that his work for that time was done he pushed his pleatedforehead through the ocean and trailing after him the intertangledlines continued his leeward way at a travellers methodic paceAs before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight againcame bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up thefloating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught atand safely landed them on her decks  Some sprained shoulderswrists and ankles livid contusions wrenched harpoons and lancesinextricable intricacies of rope shattered oars and planks allthese were there but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to havebefallen any one  As with Fedallah the day before so Ahab was nowfound grimly clinging to his boats broken half which afforded acomparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him as the previousdays mishapBut when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fastened upon himas instead of standing by himself he still halfhung upon theshoulder of Starbuck who had thus far been the foremost to assisthim  His ivory leg had been snapped off leaving but one short sharpsplinterAye aye Starbuck tis sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner whohe will and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he hasThe ferrule has not stood sir said the carpenter now coming upI put good work into that legBut no bones broken sir I hope said Stubb with true concernAye and all splintered to pieces Stubbdye see itBut evenwith a broken bone old Ahab is untouched and I account no livingbone of mine one jot more me than this dead one

again ere I could perishHowsthatTheres a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed bythe ghosts of the whole line of judgeslike a hawks beak it pecksmy brain  ILL ILL solve it thoughWhen dusk descended the whale was still in sight to leewardSo once more the sail was shortened and everything passed nearly ason the previous night only the sound of hammers and the hum of thegrindstone was heard till nearly daylight as the men toiled bylanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats andsharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow  Meantime of thebroken keel of Ahabs wrecked craft the carpenter made him anotherleg while still as on the night before slouched Ahab stood fixedwithin his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gonebackward on its dial sat due eastward for the earliest sunCHAPTER 135The ChaseThird DayThe morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more thesolitary nightman at the foremasthead was relieved by crowds ofthe daylight lookouts who dotted every mast and almost every sparDye see him cried Ahab but the whale was not yet in sightIn his infallible wake though but follow that wake thats allHelm there steady as thou goest and hast been going  What alovely day again were it a newmade world and made for asummerhouse to the angels and this morning the first of itsthrowing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that worldHeres food for thought had Ahab time to think but Ahab neverthinks he only feels feels feels THATS tingling enough formortal man to thinks audacity  God only has that right andprivilege  Thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a calmnessand our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much forthat  And yet Ive sometimes thought my brain was very calmfrozencalm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the contentsturned to ice and shiver it  And still this hair is growing nowthis moment growing and heat must breed it but no its like thatsort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthyclefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava  How the wild winds blowit they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash thetossed ship they cling to  A vile wind that has no doubt blown erethis through prison corridors and cells and wards of hospitals andventilated them and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleecesOut upon itits tainted  Were I the wind Id blow no more onsuch a wicked miserable world  Id crawl somewhere to a cave andslink there  And yet tis a noble and heroic thing the wind whoever conquered it  In every fight it has the last and bitterestblow  Run tilting at it and you but run through it  Ha a cowardwind that strikes stark naked men but will not stand to receive asingle blow  Even Ahab is a braver thinga nobler thing than THATWould now the wind but had a body but all the things that mostexasperate and outrage mortal man all these things are bodiless butonly bodiless as objects not as agents  Theres a most special amost cunning oh a most malicious difference  And yet I say againand swear it now that theres something all glorious and gracious inthe wind  These warm Trade Winds at least that in the clearheavens blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous mildnessand veer not from their mark however the baser currents of the seamay turn and tack and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift andswerve about uncertain where to go at last  And by the eternalPoles these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on theseTrades or something like themsomething so unchangeable and fullas strong blow my keeled soul along  To it  Aloft there  Whatdye seeNothing sirNothing and noon at hand  The doubloon goes abegging  See thesun  Aye aye it must be so  Ive oversailed him  How got thestart  Aye hes chasing ME now not I HIMthats bad I mighthave known it too  Fool the linesthe harpoons hes towing  Ayeaye I have run him by last night  About about  Come down all ofye but the regular look outs  Man the bracesSteering as she had done the wind had been somewhat on the Pequodsquarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direction thebraced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream inher own white wakeAgainst the wind he now steers for the open jaw murmured Starbuckto himself as he coiled the newhauled mainbrace upon the railGod keep us but already my bones feel damp within me and from theinside wet my flesh  I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeyinghimStand by to sway me up cried Ahab advancing to the hempen basketWe should meet him soonAye aye sir and straightway Starbuck did Ahabs bidding andonce more Ahab swung on highA whole hour now passed goldbeaten out to ages  Time itself nowheld long breaths with keen suspense  But at last some three pointsoff the weather bow Ahab descried the spout again and instantlyfrom the three mastheads three shrieks went up as if the tongues offire had voiced itForehead to forehead I meet thee this third time Moby Dick  Ondeck therebrace sharper up crowd her into the winds eye  Hestoo far off to lower yet Mr Starbuck  The sails shake  Stand overthat helmsman with a topmaul  So so he travels fast and I mustdown  But let me have one more good round look aloft here at thesea theres time for that  An old old sight and yet somehow soyoung aye and not changed a wink since I first saw it a boy fromthe sandhills of Nantucket  The samethe samethe same to Noahas to me  Theres a soft shower to leeward  Such lovelyleewardings  They must lead somewhereto something else than commonland more palmy than the palms  Leeward the white whale goes thatway look to windward then the better if the bitterer quarter  Butgood bye good bye old masthead  Whats thisgreen aye tinymosses in these warped cracks  No such green weather stains onAhabs head  Theres the difference now between mans old age andmatters  But aye old mast we both grow old together sound in ourhulls though are we not my ship  Aye minus a leg thats allBy heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every wayI cant compare with it and Ive known some ships made of dead treesoutlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vitalfathers  Whats that he said he should still go before me mypilot and yet to be seen again  But where  Will I have eyes at thebottom of the sea supposing I descend those endless stairs and allnight Ive been sailing from him wherever he did sink to  Aye ayelike many more thou toldst direful truth as touching thyself OParsee but Ahab there thy shot fell short  Goodbyemastheadkeep a good eye upon the whale the while Im gone  Welltalk tomorrow nay tonight when the white whale lies down theretied by head and tailHe gave the word and still gazing round him was steadily loweredthrough the cloven blue air to the deckIn due time the boats were lowered but as standing in his shallopsstern Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved tothe matewho held one of the tackleropes on deckand bade himpauseStarbuckSirFor the third time my souls ship starts upon this voyageStarbuckAye sir thou wilt have it soSome ships sail from their ports and ever afterwards are missingStarbuckTruth sir saddest truthSome men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of thefloodand I feel now like a billow thats all one crested combStarbuck  I am oldshake hands with me manTheir hands met their eyes fastened Starbucks tears the glueOh my captain my captainnoble heartgo notgo notsee itsa brave man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion thenLower awaycried Ahab tossing the mates arm from him  Standby the crewIn an instant the boat was pulling round close under the sternThe sharks the sharks cried a voice from the low cabinwindowthere O master my master come backBut Ahab heard nothing for his own voice was highlifted then andthe boat leaped onYet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the shipwhen numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark watersbeneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oarsevery time they dipped in the water and in this way accompanied theboat with their bites  It is a thing not uncommonly happening to thewhaleboats in those swarming seas the sharks at times apparentlyfollowing them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over thebanners of marching regiments in the east  But these were the firstsharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale hadbeen first descried and whether it was that Ahabs crew were allsuch tigeryellow barbarians and therefore their flesh more musky tothe senses of the sharksa matter sometimes well known to affectthemhowever it was they seemed to follow that one boat withoutmolesting the othersHeart of wrought steel murmured Starbuck gazing over the side andfollowing with his eyes the receding boatcanst thou yet ringboldly to that sightlowering thy keel among ravening sharks andfollowed by them openmouthed to the chase and this the criticalthird dayFor when three days flow together in one continuousintense pursuit be sure the first is the morning the second thenoon and the third the evening and the end of that thingbe thatend what it may  Oh my God what is this that shoots through meand leaves me so deadly calm yet expectantfixed at the top of ashudder  Future things swim before me as in empty outlines andskeletons all the past is somehow grown dim  Mary girl thoufadest in pale glories behind me boy  I seem to see but thy eyesgrown wondrous blue  Strangest problems of life seem clearing butclouds

boys hand on thehillCrazedaloft therekeep thy keenest eye upon the boatsmark well the whaleHo againdrive off that hawk see hepeckshe tears the vanepointing to the red flag flying at themaintruckHa he soars away with itWheres the old man nowseest thou that sight oh Ahabshudder shudderThe boats had not gone very far when by a signal from themastheadsa downward pointed arm Ahab knew that the whale hadsounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held onhis way a little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crewmaintaining the profoundest silence as the headbeat waves hammeredand hammered against the opposing bowDrive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermost headsdrive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin andno hearse can be mineand hemp only can kill me  Ha haSuddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles thenquickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg ofice swiftly rising to the surface  A low rumbling sound was hearda subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggledwith trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shotlengthwise but obliquely from the sea  Shrouded in a thin droopingveil of mist it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and thenfell swamping back into the deep  Crushed thirty feet upwards thewaters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenlysank in a shower of flakes leaving the circling surface creamed likenew milk round the marble trunk of the whaleGive way cried Ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forwardto the attack but maddened by yesterdays fresh irons that corrodedin him Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels thatfell from heaven  The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading hisbroad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knittedtogether as head on he came churning his tail among the boats andonce more flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances fromthe two mates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part oftheir bows but leaving Ahabs almost without a scarWhile Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks and asthe whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flankas he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up  Lashedround and round to the fishs back pinioned in the turns upon turnsin which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutionsof the lines around him the half torn body of the Parsee was seenhis sable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned fullupon old AhabThe harpoon dropped from his handBefooled befooleddrawing in a long lean breathAye ParseeI see thee againAye and thou goest before and this THIS then isthe hearse that thou didst promise  But I hold thee to the lastletter of thy word  Where is the second hearse  Away mates to theship those boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time andreturn to me if not Ahab is enough to dieDown men the firstthing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in that thing Iharpoon  Ye are not other men but my arms and my legs and so obeymeWheres the whale gone down againBut he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escaping withthe corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the lastencounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage Moby Dick wasnow again steadily swimming forward and had almost passed theshipwhich thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction tohim though for the present her headway had been stopped  He seemedswimming with his utmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuinghis own straight path in the seaOh  Ahab cried Starbuck not too late is it even now the thirdday to desist  See  Moby Dick seeks thee not  It is thou thouthat madly seekest himSetting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelledto leeward by both oars and canvas  And at last when Ahab wassliding by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish Starbucksface as he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vesselabout and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious intervalGlancing upwards he saw Tashtego Queequeg and Daggoo eagerlymounting to the three mastheads while the oarsmen were rocking inthe two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side andwere busily at work in repairing them  One after the other throughthe portholes as he sped he also caught flying glimpses of Stubband Flask busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons andlances  As he saw all this as he heard the hammers in the brokenboats far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart  Buthe rallied  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from themainmasthead he shouted to Tashtego who had just gained thatperch to descend again for another flag and a hammer and nails andso nail it to the mastWhether fagged by the three days running chase and the resistanceto his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was somelatent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the WhiteWhales way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat sorapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whales last starthad not been so long a one as before  And still as Ahab glided overthe waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him and so pertinaciouslystuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oars thatthe blades became jagged and crunched and left small splinters inthe sea at almost every dipHeed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars  Pullon tis the better rest the sharks jaw than the yielding waterBut at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smallerThey will last long enough pull onBut who can tellhemutteredwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or onAhabBut pull on  Aye all alive nowwe near him  The helmtake the helm let me passand so saying two of the oarsmen helpedhim forward to the bows of the still flying boatAt length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging alongwith the White Whales flank he seemed strangely oblivious of itsadvanceas the whale sometimes willand Ahab was fairly within thesmoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whales spout curledround his great Monadnock hump he was even thus close to him whenwith body arched back and both arms lengthwise highlifted to thepoise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into thehated whale  As both steel and curse sank to the socket as ifsucked into a morass Moby Dick sideways writhed spasmodicallyrolled his nigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole init so suddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for theelevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung Ahab would oncemore have been tossed into the sea  As it was three of theoarsmenwho foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and weretherefore unprepared for its effectsthese were flung out but sofell that in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again andrising to its level on a combing wave hurled themselves bodilyinboard again the third man helplessly dropping astern but stillafloat and swimmingAlmost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduatedinstantaneous swiftness the White Whale darted through the welteringsea  But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns withthe line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round ontheir seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment thetreacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in theempty airWhat breaks in me  Some sinew crackstis whole again oarsoars  Burst in upon himHearing the tremendous rush of the seacrashing boat the whalewheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but in thatevolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the shipseemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions bethinkingitit may bea larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore downupon its advancing prow smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foamAhab staggered his hand smote his forehead  I grow blind handsstretch out before me that I may yet grope my way  Ist nightThe whale  The ship cried the cringing oarsmenOars oars  Slope downwards to thy depths O sea that ere it befor ever too late Ahab may slide this last last time upon hismark  I see the ship the ship  Dash on my men  Will ye notsave my shipBut as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through thesledgehammering seas the before whalesmitten bowends of twoplanks burst through and in an instant almost the temporarilydisabled boat lay nearly level with the waves its halfwadingsplashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouringwaterMeantime for that one beholding instant Tashtegos masthead hammerremained suspended in his hand and the red flag halfwrapping himas with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him as hisown forwardflowing heart while Starbuck and Stubb standing uponthe bowsprit beneath caught sight of the downcoming monster just assoon as heThe whale the whale  Up helm up helm  Oh all ye sweet powers ofair now hug me close  Let not Starbuck die if die he must in awomans fainting fit  Up helm I sayye fools the jaw

her for the voyage is upFrom the ships bows nearly all the seamen now hung inactivehammers bits of plank lances and harpoons mechanically retainedin their hands just as they had darted from their variousemployments all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale whichfrom side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent abroad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as

timbers reeled  Some fell flat upon their faces  Likedislodged trucks the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on theirbulllike necks  Through the breach they heard the waters pour asmountain torrents down a flumeThe ship  The hearsethe second hearse cried Ahab from theboat its wood could only be AmericanDiving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along itskeel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again faroff the other bow but within a few yards of Ahabs boat where fora time he lay quiescentI turn my body from the sun  What ho Tashtego let me hear thyhammer  Oh ye

at thee for hatessake I spit my last breath at thee  Sink all coffins and all hearsesto one common pool and since neither can be mine let me then tow topieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damnedwhale  THUS I give up the spearThe harpoon was darted the stricken whale flew forward withigniting velocity the line ran through the groovesran foul  Ahabstooped to clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught himround the neck and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring theirvictim he was shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was goneNext instant the heavy eyesplice in the ropes final end flew outof the starkempty tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the seadisappeared in its depthsFor an instant the tranced boats crew stood still then turnedThe ship  Great God where is the ship  Soon they through dimbewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in thegaseous Fata Morgana only the uppermost masts out of water whilefixed by infatuation or fidelity or fate to their once loftyperches the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinkinglookouts on the sea  And now concentric circles seized the loneboat itself and all its crew and each floating oar and everylancepole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and roundin one vortex carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sightBut as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over thesunken head of the Indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches ofthe erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of theflag which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over thedestroying billows they almost touchedat that instant a red armand a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the actof nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar  Askyhawk that tauntingly had followed the maintruck downwards fromits natural home among the stars pecking at the flag andincommoding Tashtego there this bird now chanced to intercept itsbroad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood andsimultaneously feeling that etherial thrill the submerged savagebeneath in his deathgasp kept his hammer frozen there and so thebird of heaven with archangelic shrieks and his imperial beakthrust upwards and his whole captive form folded in the flag ofAhab went down with his ship which like Satan would not sink tohell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her andhelmeted herself with itNow small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullenwhite surf beat against its steep sides then all collapsed and thegreat shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand yearsagoEpilogueAND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEEJobThe dramas done  Why then here does any one step forthBecauseone did survive the wreckIt so chanced that after the Parsees disappearance I was he whomthe Fates ordained to take the place of Ahabs bowsman when thatbowsman assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last daythe three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat was droppedastern  So floating on the margin of the ensuing scene and in fullsight of it when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached meI was then but slowly drawn towards the closing vortex  When Ireached it it had subsided to a creamy pool  Round and round thenand ever contracting towards the buttonlike black bubble at the axisof that slowly wheeling circle like another Ixion I did revolveTill gaining that vital centre the black bubble upward burst andnow liberated by reason of its cunning spring and owing to itsgreat buoyancy rising with great force the coffin lifebuoy shotlengthwise from the sea fell over and floated by my side  Buoyedup by that coffin for almost one whole day and night I floated on asoft and dirgelike main  The unharming sharks they glided by as ifwith padlocks on their mouths the savage seahawks sailed withsheathed beaks  On the second day a sail drew near nearer andpicked me up at last
