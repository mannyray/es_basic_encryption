#Important to Note:

encryptTextFiles.sh encrypts all .txt files in current directory using encryptFile.cc, word by word with the help of crypto++ 5.6.3.

The encrypted words are stored in hex format in order to avoid nasty characters and ease of storage on elasticsearch.

Program avoids encrypting .txt files that begin with "encrypted" as those are treated as have already been encrypted in case multiple reruns are made in the same directory.

The libary for encryption is from crypto++. Make sure when you are running all encryption/decryption related code that you compile the code correctly which is demonstrated in encryptTextFiles.sh. In addition, make sure that you have a copy of the correct crypto++ library on your machine with the #include statements of crypto++ library code matching the location of the code itself.
