In addition to storing the original text files on the client side, the client must generate the encrypted text files to store on the server. The text encryption was timed to the following:


real	24m7.172s
user	20m20.564s
sys	0m17.848s

and expanded the data to 8.1G (6.3 gb additional).

The upload took about
real	44m44.151s
user	5m48.472s
sys	1m56.124s
in time and caused the data directory in elasticsearch to inflate to 11G.
