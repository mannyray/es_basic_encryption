Data was generated using the code from text_generator (./a.out dd/mywords.txt 2000 100000) to give about 1.8G of generated data (du -sh * -c). The mywords.txt file was /usr/share/dict/words without the words that contain apostrophes was used as a word bank for random word selection when generating 2000 text files with 100000 random words per file.

In addition to storing the original text files on the client side, the client must generate the encrypted text files to store on the server. The text encryption was timed to the following:


real	24m7.172s
user	20m20.564s
sys	0m17.848s

and expanded the data to 8.1G (6.3 gb additional).

The upload of the encrypted data took about
real	44m44.151s
user	5m48.472s
sys	1m56.124s
in time and caused the data directory in elasticsearch to inflate to a total 11G.

In the regular_encrypt/searchDocuments the encrypt then search was put to the test
